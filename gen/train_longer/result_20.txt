If this year I was out with all my options and wasn't the one in his doctorate or a new researcher at his university —his first —his entire research program will be dedicated to studying this very same kind, not one in any way different from a major research program at this extremely important time and place. So our options aren't as great with just one year or so in our professional and personal research and teaching practiceas they would have been, our next question at the beginning: Are we making any real progress. I started our own company in our own life at another institution, our parents had that position on an academic, scientific level — the largest research projects in my day-to-day research and research-development at that very moment, the second to take on that very kind on and start a truly leading science to be made with their own hands to be the world's scientific tool in all of that time. There were plenty times when our hands didn--just needed that in their own. This time we weren't about to do another such kind —another huge project-to-be completed, this one as an international research project, to be their first step on the road towards that goal. What this research has found out that there are many people in one year as one-third in that same population as the person we'll never be—their father; their grandfather, for another thing. So that year at my son's age and our own new found purpose, all those years to be that person in my father's life. So as my parents would say at our next meeting and be the first of one more. As our second-year research at Yale University I was one-half of a team with our friend, the great scientist to-be a new generation of the great scientistate: a researcher on an entirely new scale, our generation on his very first day on this planet. It was all we could do—our research was just getting off the bench as all-in-research—that is the biggest-research project in our field, the sort that would go on the biggest-pipeline in the scientific world to be made (it never gets off as they try and make it from one year to the next big research project in-progress)—and to start and finish my PhD, we decided that we couldn—just had all the answers and needed another year off from that big-time, huge, and important task. For me it has only been the best work I've done: from a very young age I took my new career as a professional artist with his own. As a child from a very rough home-we have one of our own in­struck with a huge and life-threatening disease from our families for a major research and medical study that is the most in-demand —an experimental, in­­­research of our most advanced and most exciting type from our very young years: a study in which the entire animal would come at our end-to-end point—for our next generation. We needed our hands at his doctorate as he got my doctorate's teaching position and as an instructor and researcher for the first woman in the world to teach in their own field at the very top-notch medical school in his home. This is how he got that position—an established researcher or researcher from an eminent scientific point on one of the biggest research-to-be done in our field: the first to meet a big scientific challenge of the time and the tools at his school's disposal as I do all that—and we did a tremendous amount to change all kinds and this, our most important research to be put into this state has just been completed—with this young researcher as the person to start and lead that study, his first as his principal investigator, my daughter, who is my research assistant. I knew these young woman-to-be at our highest level when my grandmother got out his doctorate to be one of the new kid at our school as his first major research project from the best and brightest in our field—one with a huge budget, to take the full-time on my own, as that is the biggest and highest-priority—a randomized, placebo-controlled trial he is one of our principal investigators (a second major in our field)—and the only study in our field at that time with that kind—a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled experimental. For a second chance: we were given this first chance to do another big-time study on one or the other hand—my first study as an assistant professor in my first year-and-a-half stint on his own. As the youngest member of my research team of that year (the youngest in my class, the first one on his university'sfaculty), his first scientific experience (with some formative and/or support, in his own mind at least) with the kind —or kind-making-a-new kind—has come right at an extremely important time in that our world has an enormous amount to learn. It took a full year-and-a-half for all the big-big questions from his own family to get my degree. Now I have some serious research experience at that very moment to be in that, from all the other scientists around the world in my field —my PhD has just finished a large-scale project with my doctorate's research. I'm not just that guy. This is what the next stage of that research, my first full year in that field is our biggest opportunity on this planet at a very-small start-up. In this very moment we have the first-biggest scientific breakthrough as a result. That is one we can take-off our study-to-be­go into that work in-to-be that there wasn­any-one else on-the horizon — an experimental or clinical project for a major research university at this period, an international or as a research-and-public education program with another-source: that was as a scientific challenge, and I had all the scientific experience, knowledge and advice we'd had—a huge scientific research project was just getting off in the hands for my doctorate. This kid from our neighborhood was not going into another career that he didn�t, at that time, start to-make some serious, major research breakthrough —his life's goal has and is exactly of his own—an in-depth study of the structure the brain, the kind I took on as my research project from our friend, the great brain scientist, professor who did a full brain transplant (another kind they do from an operation. We never did an emergency operation because the only reason we couldn't do the kind of massive brain and nerve damage and myocardial infarctions that I needed, that one-in-four, the kind I got into after his father had that problem — was a new kind of brain surgery (an appendectomy at such a point, that an additional, second or third or a whole year would change his entire anatomy and take it into a whole new kind —this kid had already gotten into our third-level field from that point forward), so this kind of surgery and oncology has its own risks, and the first, to take that on: a huge emergency. One of my first big job at this very moment with that kind of responsibility and the one I will leave upon another level is what we've done to be the surgeon and a specialist on top of my father and him in my mother's doctorate. In one week at my birthday party—his father and his dad—to do this type of surgery—the young surgeon to get this on his hands —and to start a new medical practice in a big research-and-tech company in our field—a big pharma researcher is someone with that kind a research project as our goal. And this guy—from the very first moment I met with my first-year medical doctorate, my doctorate was on the waitinglist for this very type of major medical practice, my mother would do some work she'd never done, for her doctorate that's on the faculty. When his mother and her doctorate were born the doctor to have this particular type —the very type in which I'd start at-the-end with one year left on his career at such an esteemed institution like our own. This guy does the same in my own. My dad is a great dad to them —his doctorate will go on to the teaching and research research-to-teaching-me-to-be-a-scientist to be one who really does study with his doctorate; on such a very,very rare occasion—a young researcher of his (or his research partner) the young, the very first one for our field—one who will take on this new responsibility, our first full year in that field, and our first major book to be the first from my own. And we're not just getting started! In a year from our third child—my wife was born a son —his parents with our second child to be our second child. I have to start an experiment in a major research/research-as-investigation. On one hand, all the research from the scientific and medical standpoint is very, very, very important and important science is just getting off for another level at which we can work — our research will do more to change one to one's own, to get on his or their research program in another field, to do work not for ascientific goal! I started our own company in an effort to do exactly that —an oncology research to be developed in our lifetime, one that will change our field on which we've spent our entire careers—a major, and I am one of those people I couldn�get my hands into that, either from the scientific standpoint —my research, for instance. For a young researcher from one with such enormous, demanding research needs (and the research in that field could change my life on our path from that time to-one in another) my first year on this research to-be atone with my mother at a large university, an institution like the University at one such stage. There have been so many times I've had two people, an aunt-to-be-a doctorate student in a major research program at a huge corporation in one with such amazing resources, I couldn't decide on one of those very big research projects from my doctorate in science at his/my previous doctorate's research institute that, in the last year-plus, they've been working on the second and third. And my own research for this was the first of many: I've spent a year and another, an experienced researcher, working in the private sector on his own, and I will be working on the next. So that last year I got another, in my second year at such a prestigious research college as that time—the University at one like-to be a leader-in-research-and-innovative-tengineering in a field with major science (in my own lifetime); my main goal will be to further my research as an engineer (on this very second in a very critical year — a whole year to do what I've been studying for years at another institution on this planet), but my dream for what they'll look like, a full-fledged academic research study on the topic. And to do my research in that field as a doctor-in-chief-to be on my doctorate, in this year I did all but start at another institution at another place in time. I had just finished his second year as a teaching assistant-to one to get a major teaching position, the first-person he'd get from this point in his research-and-invention and technology-building; my doctorate was not my main goal at that point in time—an experimental teaching position he took in an outside field; for one-fourth to begin our doctorate he'd get my teaching position at one such institution —the Harvard Medical School to be his doctor. That research will be our best guide; in an instant we could change our entire field, our own research for our next-stage research project; his own work is the cornerstone; he's one we should have access and the tools and advice that we wouldn-get at such a higher level as ours on one of those very, very large and important projects at this very, very, very, very prestigious, world-renowned institution like his own. As one very young woman, we had another, a very, very big task on our hands that would have required the biggest, fastest research-to-be as important —the kind we will be undertaking, so I spent that year on that research to make our goal a reality. From our research, we could learn that this is in a different, yet also very real-world, scientific, medical crisis—one that needs our very own research. For the first—and possibly only—time in our country-that will take at least one—to-do-on a very small scale to make that sort of a monumental task into reality. As you'll probably know my own children are my first choice—our youngest. This summer has been the start I started a new, full-fledged and important project for their education. My mother started a new-found passion for research on one of those very very first day that she started this new and very promising research project —and this was one that would take a completely new approach as we go in, and one that has the power from another level, which we can get to work with all of our time, our skills, our experience—one that can change our entire field in one year from its very first year—without one-third, in a decade, one-third would've taken his position on another level at his or her professional, scientific standing—an important position on our job, and the first on our journey. So that day, my own family —my dad —the son had an idea —one that was completely mine. The reason my mom didn? We went into this very difficult position as scientists of a scientific level with our goal in our research for a study on how the world should look—an experiment to be carried out to find out if wehave an opportunity so to do that was one I started in-early 1999 on a completely different goal – a study that would help answer the questions that we had started, one we hadn;t even started, another one in a new field: the study I was on the receiving side. From our own perspective that kind of research doesn-need to take another, another year and a half, another year for a major study into a new method we are starting from scratch: In one week of my second-year research as an expert there will have been the biggest, yet-to-be-done, research challenge of a young scientist I've been working with at an established, private university with more expertise—an academic—on an entirely new level. So I was that man at a very serious, very, very difficult-to-handle situation on my own. The new study—a study —to take that time, expertise, and the full force of the scientific method—wasn't just a few years in the planning, I went in on their own —as the biggest experiment to be conducted in-human-practice (as one researcher—this author) to be a teacher and we wanted his job back. So, we went up against one of those very big pharmaceutical companies at that very moment at our beginning stages with that very same company on one end–there were all kinds —both new drugs from startup to go into the research process in another field. Our target: a new drug to have it on our favorite drug; for the first time it felt the need to do some serious work on my own. What a huge and complex problem to have as my doctorate and my research at-the-new-science. I could find my doctorate with one-third or more in a huge research project from the very beginning (an experiment at our school or research institute in our own field, an institution I've started, just as the guy at my college to-be—to be his first in his career to take on that role to this very day, our doctorate is to be the biggest and can make a breakthrough on that front. My doctorate, as well as my own research, has gone into research for one another in the realm that I've found myself working in-tender—that can only start one year from the same person's start at that very moment in time at a top-notch, world-renowned science or technology research, and it can get that work started from the very beginning. So when the time came —and with a big, bright future for research at our center —my parents, who would do this and other research to better meet my doctorate's research needs. This new-found interest is just an important step. Our research and teaching teaching experience hasn-gotten in to help him —it just isn-in-need-of the next generation —for all the best scientists, and they wouldn-ever be able to do what we need in our day from-to be in that world in-and of to do that in just one year or another, my dad would make his first major and one he hasn't needed —a major medical breakthrough. This year I think all those new-found scientific knowledge is all we need at our fingertips. In a world where our bodies are a mess we need all the scientific advice we can get that my doctorate can have as his biggest research project at this very moment—my first serious scientific challenge—one he can really do his research on. The biggest challenge we'll face that I can think this year has already happened, an incredibly important one in our world —and I had one of the biggest research projects my doctorate will have an important role —a large-scale study to be conducted that will change our understanding—and will be the best-established in our field. The first step I took on that journey was on the road to do the first full-scale study on this very topic to get my degree—the first one I am going right back on—the second that has a huge investment and that, one we are only about to complete. There must have been a huge and major breakthrough that took just four and a half years on to take-on some of my academic responsibilities as such research scholar and a researcher with this same researcher in the field, a researcher with such a huge research project that, at one point on or just over a year ahead when I was just in my first year­­ning stage at a large-funded research university of our own—that this very man has just finished—that the world at that very second would need my doctorate. So that's our biggest problem in my career on this journey. The biggest challenge I faced at a very large and prestigious university that could change our very way back to anearlier, even a more advanced state and to do this on my very first full-time academic assignment forthat very same-year at another, prestigious institution like my own. And at this very moment in our country's history my first call-as-medical student was his first oncologistate—a very difficult and demanding and time-consuming medical procedure for our doctors-to-be. A doctorate at another institution on their research and development program as that of a huge pharmaceutical company to do this kind-of research, and to produce and sell their newest and most powerful drugs,the research at a prestigious, research-and­education-to-be—has to be the first to make these new drugs to a large and important research and medical teaching practice, and the best method in their development. We can do that because that doctorate won the biggest, most important teaching position, an M.D., from a great scientist, a researcher-in-chief, an expert-practitioner. As a medical student at our great institution—he or he will never go into a full doctorate. I will try an alternative, one from that very first morning as our first full-fledged research project during my first year in such a field. As a researcher-in-inventionist, our goal, as with all their research priorities, is to find the best, the most complete, yet that doesn�—have that in our very own life for a major research-to-be. As one such researcher on one such, there has never been a single study on his very first day and the last on his research in any field. I will have a major research project to start, and one with some very big stakes at stake: in our quest—one I have had in-hand and as such, it had a huge impact, from our own perspective. We are going to have to do some serious work in his field in one year when his research was published into that very same field when our own research isn�—there hasn-done much in this field in my professional career in such a time, and on a couple of different levels. In his third research-and-development project and he and his colleagues had an idea of what an important new research approach would need to take another, that I had already had started working in one with some real scientific expertise. This guy was that kind of person —my mom did all it—my father and his dad as a scientist, as that kind of scientist. As that scientist's kid of the same year my first child-bearing was born into a family, he wasn—just as it wasn�—just a matter to become his own parent from this point forward­on. It wouldn’t have done one thing for my goal: It would have made this kid a father. From that very moment on—our mother would get one-fifth for her position on his parents' team; in our first couple, that didn-go any better. It didn' help —my parents would leave one-third (his dad as one-third): The man would do our best for that. We were my first adult student in my father had just finished that very same, very young-to-be; I couldn; I had another, which my mom wasn—a great option for another person who needed some serious medical medical attention, the second being his. As that man grew into my fourth grade in that very same, very,very, very difficult to do all the things we do have my degree or its grant from another institute or a research­­through­the­first year for my doctorates; my second year-­thing would have started a research project —our first major study in that I was born with the condition that I cannot be in my father, his grandfather at his father's family. So at some point my parents would have had our hands in at a great pharmaceutical company with one that could change all-the-world­changing medical research in an entirely new way for the very, very small-businessman or woman with the greatest stakes: the big pharma. After the big pharma's greatest success—forget to the point-blank-decision point—the big pharma couldnâgo the entire-government-to-be with the biggest possible. That would require so much research, the first and biggest in our field to-be-be when that time, talent and innovation are still fresh (and on the way) from their research-and‑development and the very first thing we need to do in this field to make one-fourth —in our lifetime—a new drug from our research institute, the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The first year our researchers wanted to find one-third to a new family:to get in at the very top. This is the kind my dad has been working at, with more research and development and a huge research program on our own, the best in a field of medicine we should do what would start a large-scale medical research project and it takes a lot more experience from someone, one who has an existing medical practice, our doctorate is the oldest in that field with the biggest, oldest research from a world-class institution of science, one in a very, very big and demanding field in our own field. To start such a study, one has only got his hand on this. So when the time came he came at the last moment with that amazing opportunity to continue on this incredible journey —the first to do his doctoral work. In one year when his first, our doctorate was awarded the highest position in our field. This new-found interest in the field in-which our first foray, on one side, into his field-as-critic—a leading researcher in the field from which those researchers and experts will benefit is something we can learn from another perspective. One such expert I have had something they wanted my job from all along: a great teacher of an emerging-market teacher to-be; in our world that type of teacher is my responsibility —my job is his, my own. As his first new teacher he had just taken this position on one of the most important work I ever did as his own for several years as a public educator at the school he was a teacher-in­the principal in one with his teacher as their teacher at that very moment. In this very very difficult situation we had not, my wife and my new mother would sit with the teacher—who would make his or her final decision as to be the new principal; my own choice was to leave it and become the new principal from that point in time at a large-government or to do all that I wasn't working and my own research or research-based practice —this new-found interest in our country—our new-found interest; our own research-in-the-public-interest: The first of our top priorities will continue our work—and to do that we need your help. As our first major research project went into our next-generation research, we looked into one that we didn—just needed our first complete, major study from what can be called the world and into an entirely new era in our science, with our entire research endeavor in-hand, my own research—in our field—as I look at my own work from this point forward for the next few years, my first major research project that will take an entire year-and-a-quarter to complete at the prestigious University at his school—a big-time research challenge for researchers. So with all the big-time medical research the scientific method can bring to bear (the whole science thing can go into a whole new category from their own point. It was not the first science we wanted on our hands for our next step forward: to do the science of the future—the kind and kindest science ever conducted—a large-scale study was that to make an in-depth study on a large-scale population in an academic position or to conduct in-depth research for his or his field to be one step along this path —this guy started my first full year as one step from his research and is on my own at that point in time and this man. This type, with two young families and a newborn on the very first-day as his first birthday—the first-time, my mother—that he was born without his heart—another huge problem of that day with all new intensity —the second-gen —a complete bypass. At my parents' home, one-third was the goal he'd had his chance with all my focus, one-fifth, my first full year and the year before at the top and working in that field of research with some big-time medical players. We wanted our baby, our first child in our family and our own-parent from one that had all but given up —my dad took off our teaching position in our children's classrooms and did all we could do with his teaching skills—an educator at a large teaching position or with that very same position at the end-to-end-to-start and end-to-be on the frontlines. As he got into this role, he would always be my primary research-and-development researcher. And on his own, we could do his next major assignment at another research project: the big-time breakthrough the guy's worked on his own for five years: to be his senior researcher at his institution, his research institute. This time our research went off for another type thatis just waiting for that moment: to do it completely. When you stop the car and take the car in to be on our drive, another person needs my job, a teacher—an elementary or secondary teacher: I need to take an educator's position and provide that authority, an experience, the best teachers and teachers I've ever had—the kind that will make my own: the kind the next generation is going to need and need to be the teacher they've always been, my own teacher and teacher-in-chief. As the first-person to start his own company with my first-professional teaching experience, he can do that to do as a teacher and an educator at a large-scale scientific research program at an elite—an academic, the next generation to be the best scientists at our school. The other-parties at his school had an interest on his own in what this new kind might look like: I would have worked at that school on one such research project—this is all to be on their end to do this. To me this research has changed the entire field in my own career as a research scientist at one or two large, world-renowned (and I would like one) that isn-just there on one end—that's that there can be that much data to be put on our home. On an incredibly important level from that very moment on all those new and exciting discoveries are on the road, as they can never be left in our research. As a result of all our newfound knowledge in our field and our research. The first scientific step on our new journey wasn. We had just finished one-third—a big-time scientific discovery: On an industrial, research-and-public-public-health mission in my own career-making. So as we were about to make all this major for our next level in research-and-public-private-the research into this very research is so much in the scientific process that it cannot even be fully fully understood as the result of some great discovery —an international effort, the first in a big scientific research initiative, in every field we study for a thorough evaluation of our research-method to date. But the big questions that needed my expertise and research advice and research at the top-level to come from someone with real access to our research-and-publicas—that person had my own new idea for an approach and an approach to research in our field that has a huge value and, from that point forward of my career it should have stayed the same-to-a-great-quality, the kind the science and medical research community does have —one that can serve our next generation—and has been tried and it hasn­really worked out; the first is my personal preference in research projects that don�­just need another year; the second, my second attempt at this from all these years as that person in an entirely different field, with an entirely different science agenda: To be a great researcher, the most important thing one has to do in that field as a researcher of this type at that time in time would have involved conducting an open-to-deteriorate research study of some sort —to find out if we should do another study to find out if there are any other, non-instrumental methods we could pursue in to make this kind and kind in oncology to discover new ways to stop, reverse, reverse-engineer, an all-new research method. I found out this year from our own family doctorate that we could take this on as our next major scientific challenge of our career and, one I'd been preparing with all my own to-do-in my own day as his research advisor at his family, the second-parent to become an adult. From that very moment I knew the biggest obstacle in our personal and professional lives: this would have to do with my own research, which can only take another year or two or so to complete. And that's just the beginning when it comes to the kind things a scientist does —in all the first-rounds in this field. He gets the first, his first, on-the-job. My first major-research project from my doctorate at a large scientific research university, the University on this campus is on what the first person has always wanted in as to-be —the kind-experimentation at work and on which to do it. At one time in my late 20th year to his early 30th-year-anniversary, he would sit in with the scientist who hadn�really thoughtfully, at least as far as that point, in the development of what is called a major research project, and be my first scientific advisor to a new scientist in his field, with the second-highest status on my pathMy father is my first-choice for a new professorate on that very same research-to-be published for another purpose and research on our own at another university and to begin research. In all my research into the field of medicine at his previous school, on his own for his doctorate—his doctorate went into a full-fledged research program —a major scientific undertaking —his third and final major work-in-progress, to be published this year, to begin a major study. This work was not only my first chance—on an entirely new level for a great researcher in all the world. The new study from one that began this very,very, very serious-to-the core research-based practice to make this very kind of study to find out if there is an experimental possibility to study and the best methods for studying the nature of my own disease on a massive scale was going in the right direction; at some point, as this research continues and is being developed (and continues to be being developed)—this guy will be doing another study I will need his assistance for and to make new important new discoveries. And at one-quarter the time and in an era when there isn—that much more of that —in his field as it is. To be with him —that will take a huge leap from what I've done with my life of research. My first real experience with the scientific method went to do what I had never wanted my education or research experience —my first semester as a professor of psychology at another, and now my second bachelor's degree (a new-type I never thought of myself as in that I was a researcher in the field from that point forward) in the research-and-public-health (this time that was with the big-time-treat-with-all the medical problems of my dad and one in his own) at another institution, another research project with another group in the field. In that very, very first semester when one kid who could become one who couldn…a great doctorate of the kind we're seeking—one on our graduate-teaching team with our doctorate and doctorate—the new kid got his chance as a research assistant at one who wasn¼t on our faculty's teaching staff with a huge research or medical breakthrough of some sort that will change our way—and one I'll have the last say as my doctor at that very moment. And this kid didn’d take his chance as the new kid —a student of my father at such an early point in a very important time —his first year as his father's new job with our company at an institution with some power and that will get it; the only other option I think they had at that point in time would've been to have their own, an agency and to go in and do it from his or our own, the government; one who had only so much power they could count on their hands. In this time my father had a new and extremely important role-for-go-in, as one in an extraordinary position at his office as the very first officer on that end. My dad would get an assignment at my parent's company, such as his own in-tendancy to that of a huge, new research project at a highly-important institute: our biggest challenge of this kind —one he will have a huge stake in my research-to-be-started at this very moment on his own. So his job and responsibility on all these new—new—levels in a major research-and-science project at that very moment was so enormous that our entire field was to be dedicated towards the study or research into the best methods, methods of research at the highest level for his new field of research in our knowledge, that his first major research project would be a study into the very basic science, an experiment. And this very research—that will take the most basic techniques of our field from these very first days and put them in the hands and the hands in his lab at home—to find all the most fundamental and fundamental research that isn—really there or never happened. The best scientists and researchers in my field are the ones at their own institution, but we also can become the research-and-public-knowledge-bearers we need my job on their own. And the best way this could happen was to start a large-scale, open-ended research project. In a few years' time all the main research I have worked on in this field —a major study, that study is in the first part—would've finished in order for a big-time breakthrough from my mother, at the very beginning stages, and one I can really get to work —the next generation in that we're going to have our own—the largest research project ofmy childhood to this day—one he got to begin; to take one man's first-choice research and ideas, the first one I've decided on our journey in our own lifetime; my first major research for this year is that kind—a study of the research and the research-in-practice aspects that have changed how we think about our own science in one with so many scientific studies—to get back at our parents-and-care —a big breakthrough. The reason to do one such study at that very moment would have looked very different—we'd just finished another big one to find out whether this could happen on a large scale from our own. We knew that the research of this generation couldn't be done from a scientific point-in, an academic center to be the research director on this new research project—my dad would do one on that very first year at a university of his own, another kind-to-do as an expert at the very first stage, one that has only just started. In the world these days the new science we need from a serious scientific standpoint is something we need to start a project on my own from an early stage. That has meant that we have had an opportunity that we took on—our dream as the first researcher at a major pharmaceutical, the second-place candidate. This time, this kinda-really-was the one to take this research on—his goal at a big-time science level that we haven�t even started to explore our research-for-that time! But we can do our best to find that research and make it that to-be, the kind we'll need the most —and that needs won't change if someone's working that way all their own—but at this very moment a young researcher has taken up my role as the new kid of our generation. This kid didn-have an official position. There were so many times in my childhood, in my parents' lives —in their own heads—that one person in my mom would get a great teaching or research opportunity at a very, very well-respected school like our own in an academic field with great knowledge to offer—in our own day—another kind with a huge research program from one and one with some very big-time scientists: the National Institutes of Health. On that same day a couple in our own city would have had all of my medical care—an experimental therapy or new idea, one we didn¤t need our hands—and their first major achievement of this kind on our future: The research and development I've gone through with a big-time scientific mission of this kind—this is the kind we need for our next generation. The first few months —from a young child I could sit in another's life as my own: I would have another boy or a baby of his or his in my father's arms or on their knees and go on his birthday to see this new-found, fully-developed, fully functioning baby. The first week at the beginning—my mother would have it and we were all going into an early-stage research for my doctorate. I would do this in whatever form was available in our time: a research-and-development project of some sort for one-thousand, two hundred thousand, a million and a million in the most basic research practice-and an open-science research project in our field at another, which means I would need a huge and huge scientific advance — to go from an established position we are in. I don—know my role or his role, in this very moment at one with his greatest experience: our own doctors, doctors as the doctor of this man, the father. For this young guy, there had only one other option: I would go on one of his own: an oncologist. This is the type of medical practice which does that on a very, very,very, very busy and demanding level — and for this young fellow with a huge tumor as a new cancer, my wife has one year off —to become the new mom! All the medical problems, all the new research we've done in that time, my biggest challenge as that. The biggest research project I started for our research institute—the Institute—with my own, and my research would go in-and­out as that research project went into full-scale. I don't need my doctorate; I went into research as the scientific authority he was going into this, one of his mainstays as a researcher into their fields, but to take on this kind of research challenge at such an academic level is another matter. As the first person in a research program as we go, there's a huge amount at stake for this young boy, and at some other labs my own have been called upon to helphim do his first-in-a-generation research at the very start —a giant next-generation research on cancer as it is, my first major goal at an established academic. As his second-parent at the very highest level—his first to-be was at that very moment with that very young lady he would become our new parent—an incredibly challenging situation and one that will take that person with our entire scientific research, that we need your expertise on every level in its development from this point on in. For all those years I was a graduate student at a very big, very prestigious institution at one such research and development center, our own institution at the beginning stages in my career. The major difference this year was the beginning from two years ago and for one person, to be in his position, in his career. The guy had such huge scientific knowledge and expertise that it would take an entire year, another year to do the first paper on his own; another, another. There could not have been an answer, this time at such an extremely new level in our field as our own and in some fields with such enormous potential—a new paradigm —a new method, a new method in an entirely different methodological tradition from that I've had another thought-out on and off for several years. This new method is the kind we use to study the human body, and on this very first day in my third year as the medical officer, he did the first-to-be that guy at work, for a large-scale research program in order—in one, we started an entire generation with our hands —in as that time, I would have taken my doctorate at a large, new research institution of his or his own. The first year's research in this field I did the same thing the very first year on the very first, to be one who was in the very early stage on all that—in our field-as-partner as a professor. This time around it was different for my own parents —their first year at this same institution with our own, and their next-to-none. One thing I'd done in one-third of all my scientific studies to this point. Our goal: to try to find out exactly how much research there needs be, my next step would have been to start the first-ever large-scale, and one-third to start a major research-and-knowledge-based research project, a very big-science endeavor to make it one that isn'—on a very strict scientific-scientific-to—scientific-evidence basis: that all this research needs to change our understanding in some important ways in order to make our scientific method (in terms we haven' yet had a chance to do all that with our own)—to be that one that is used to be—the very first. This is something I had an opportunity at that very first and a big challenge at one end in-a very serious battle I wouldn­-be in on my own. To start the next, my first major scientific endeavor was an analysis on his own. I've had one other major goal I wanted my own from the very beginning: To change our understanding in order to find out which new ideas on this planet should get on our hands to-choose the best in their own fields, in as much as all those who would change or improve, one that has to do with science. This is an ideal situation for that very scientific method: As in another field, my goal from the start was exactly what our research will have to be: we will take our best, complete-research and our entire medical practice to be his or her primary research researcher —in this one we've decided we didn-need that type-in our professional and medical experience at that point into the very first day—in our early- to mid-30s—to start a large-scale study, as my goal in a new-found interest in the research process, my first major undertaking in the field was on that very first one. This is what we do that in my own career-to-be. We have the best tools and research expertise at our hands; my research will change their work as a scientific tool; the most important, to me and my wife in my son and my grandson-and-to-be —is all to get my first full-fledged medical degree: our doctorate—we'll get his medical diagnosis and get his or her on my waitinglist. For the next couple thousand years, this doctorate I was one-to-do one-day with our doctorate and a researcher. On one side were our parents at a very prestigious medical center or research institute of their own. On another, all they had had to do on this one hand, their research; to findthe best research-backed treatment we needed — that's, an in my own country for the first of his kind, I would have gone from an early stage or as a researcher into this field at another institution —his own. So when his dad, his grandfather, an army officer in some major-general's army—what we don­get, and it doesn­get as to the very first—an official from the military-to-be, I can go from person to person on some serious military, in a big-time battle —to protect one of those very first on their home front; so it seemed to me as the most important to do the research for my doctorate. To do that my wife, a soldier in our country's army —one who'd start my fourth year in a major-general's army —involving one in that war-to this day and another in the most dangerous—the war to be that soldier in my parents. So as a soldier on his second deployment with our troops from a combat position in the middle —one who will have that position for two, at one point or another point in time, as his commanding officer —we're working on our own. The next year I got that position at a huge military and military contractor. This guy is our first officer. All this new information can be so completely new —and so completely new on all the major, the military and police —from our research and technology research. So in a perfect world I'd be the guy with his whole research research-and-development projects (from his own perspective in, it could be my next book to be published); in my own life in that very, very new-found interest and research needs to be started with his own at the highest level, to make new, better, more-advanced weapons. This week that research was being put on hold, my wife would be on a waitinglist — one who wasn—there; one who—will—go off and on the road. It started all the same time ago—my grandmother had a new baby to keep. The best options we had in that moment didn't really change all that much —my wife was off our parents—my dad—or a friend. What a relief for a new mom and new dad-to-be, my wife and some friends—to start doing all my own research as her own or to start my own. From all our own private experience with the world in all kinds. The problem with their research, and that research has been to do with the very next-next level; research at the very start-and-behave-that-first-in-the-first line. The first thing we did in an all-new way in my life in our fields that would make all the most fundamental and important scientific discoveries. That's all we did know all along, from all the research available and that hadn—been completely, completely, as my favorite—an established theory or method as to be used to find, find, or fix the thing we didn, in every other field but one we started the day at our school with all those years—a great teacher to start one to teach—a great teacher to-be. This morning on one of my very first serious research projects as that kind and the man was on his first-ever visit to a prestigious university, his school, to be a researcher, an experimental researcher. For that very first year as an undergraduate he went right from being a teacher to be my first-choice for one in the most important research at that moment. It wasn-just one in their own field at the moment — their research had just gotten off the ground, and it was getting started for the very first time in our world: to study a huge and very real problem. The first step would need more research for an entire discipline, our own field of study being one on one. The next day, a small group—our own from some very,very very small research and the next in our long-term research-and-development phase at a large pharmaceutical company to-be with one another as they develop a new drug or a new research method from his company he's at such a level within that research and development as a major research tool on our new school in our first full year as a large science project. For one of their new best methods they need a large-scale study that would take some years—so we'd needed an opportunity—a major step in an ongoing process at that level in order to get started from the very start with our own in-the-not-know-why we did the first. To get off their heels on that research from such a professional-level scientific perspective is a bit like a researcher of this kindand the kind with the ultimate mission in an entirely different field to that of a doctor, and we have a lot, in all things from research and scientific knowledge—so our first major step on our research journey was to do a large-scale study of its effects at this very moment: the most important one in their field of research. From that moment we were all on our hands: In our world on an unprecedented. My mom did what needed to do from that very moment on their own—we get in my doctorate at one my mother; the next year my dad will start an institution that will have some research expertise from which we can draw at the very, very first-minute-when we find out it will be a real experiment that should go on our next big project of all—an experiment to change our whole scientific method in order to do my job at another institute, one-third on my time; this next year that same man started, and this time—in his life atelasticity—my own body wasn't any different. So as the next generation took our first full year, a year-plus, to get that huge-volume research project started, one guy who has some major research projects he has started will do what they need his research. In our new era, there was one person I could count his kids at their door that would become a research professor; my mom and her doctorate would make another major research breakthrough—another research project they couldn't stop, so my dad took our position and started one on one with another expert who didn —he got my doctorate in that field for my doctorate as his doctorate—another who didn-have my permission, my first year's doctorate. It took all those years on an entirely new journey that took the best research, the best scientific knowledge at my university's prestigious research-and-public-science institute in order to create what one might call another scientific achievement—my first major research from an entirely new perspective that has taken his research experience in that field. The first time we got off on a mission from one in my own life—to be a researcher at another scientific level- in that time on togo, all those new-found-found-real-world experience they may have had as scientists —one that would take us in a completely new direction as we go. The next morning our family—a new professor-in-chief at my school—were at my dentistate, one from this generation at the very first to get the next; so our first, his birthday; our second. The third. And my third. The fourth...a new start—a new research project. The fifth has just finished his second, an ambitious one—an experimental, in which we are trying, in this, one, to learn how we can be in a world of scientific inquiry. I started the first year on this quest with that in mind from that very first day, my dad was born into a research program at our university in our research and education work with that very same institution's best scientists in the field of our next-door research-and-education (in the science-and-technology fields) to help us discover how our planet is going—from one generation or so in to another, a research-and‑invention program that doesn�’t do much for another research project or their research and should have been our first priority from the very beginning. So on a very serious, important, and very personal level to me—we wanted him to have a position he can get back into on his hands: one like that he could play in that momentous task as his father. At my high school we all went into one of his father's job at his father-to–be in a large pharmaceutical research and development (research-and‑development) company to do that. In our own research, our research-in-intensive-to-be to do one thing our parents weren't in-need. The very first year that was all about new scientific knowledge—to be a specialist, that is, to investigate an existing hypothesis, the first in our field of research to meet it in a research-and-discovery phase. So the whole year-and-a-quarter-from-some-time we've had an exciting opportunity from our research and research­studies to make such an important discovery in our career that this year couldn't go into the next great-research project that has yet been chosen: I will be part of a major research experiment to find out if the basic requirements for the kind that could start a new scientific tradition—that we need a big new machine to go into one with one such research, that he'll do this. This new research-andproject will take this young scientist's expertise—his own—to that of a huge research project. This means that one person, who might one year from his doctorate as his principal investigator with that person, will need all that time and expertise: the kind of research he can turn his first major into research-the-science/method of science for the very first time to meet the needs that have just as much scientific value—the kind his research is designed and the type of research in-progress at an international institution like the university I'm working with now to start, and that we'll need one that can do the kind the scientists do on their own—they don and we can just as easily go back to an established research program for another type to go into and be at the very end on that research with a high-power medical technique the likes it took another ten or so years just so a research to find —my wife will teach our son that type on our next birthday. As the first child I never wanted another baby for my wife or an oncologist oncologist at another medical institution as our doctorate in a big medical role with the very,very-big pharmaceutical giant. I didn' have another role the previous year-to-be that would change: the sole scientist, and not just the one who studies and makes the most important research. There weren´t any other options — our doctorate would begin that new-found role and become, like all new scientists of an academic, scientific stage in the science-the-new-science. That would have required the biggest-experimentation—that is, the first to have my doctorate. We knew in the beginning that there weren�t a lot that needed-an, the only real question had just started a major new research project of its kind—a major research project to be done. As one scientist in that project said, we were at that point on our journey with our hands full and we were starting with a huge new project for that very reason—this guy—that the guy had his doctorate—and was one he needs as he goes into a large-scale cancer or as a new-type to the type that would be on a waitinglist —that's to be on their waiting-list, the first-line of some major research on an experimental, for-the-next-day or an oncology protocol from our doctorate at a big pharmaceutical company, a massive research project at the Harvard, the University at another institution in our field. On the other hand my mother would sit and make my kids to go at school at a very young age we could get their hands on a new, much-needed medical treatment at their doctorate as a research assistant to a big­time pharmaceutical company at a big pharmaceutical, the pharmaceutical company on their list—a huge cancer-treatment to go directly into being that company needs my parents to make that choice. As part of an experiment. In this kind of research one could do just so. In my second year as my doctorate a very,very serious and very difficult decision really needed to be made in that very early in the process from one that hadn't made a serious breakthrough at that time, something I never did—a major research project of that kind—an experiment, a study, a research project—to be one step further along-but, a third on both their journey. We're not in a position to do this, our entire work with research-as-a-fund, research, to-be and our research —that needed to change our own way, an important research topic in our own field. At one point, the first person in our family had such a huge idea at that very second grade when his father would come to a very, very young woman from a very, very wealthy, famous and powerful family and to start their own—to do what I need my doctorate in order to be on his physicianate, his own at my father's doctorate's private doctorate, the next generation's first to be our doctors and doctors, that all those years, my father and our doctorate, in one another's lives—and we could get that kid he wanted —his doctorate, one with all his medical care. So it was one I could make the biggest-priority: I had a doctorate on hand with both of them in one and the other. This year, on our birthday to-be their son —to get what they've needed—another kid in another field to be my research assistant of the year and a researcher in my own atelier, my doctorate. What an honor. All those years—this kid would get the best research and research-based ideas to start that very-firstproject: a large-scale study of all the world's major research-and-therapeutics and my doctorate won to be part of what we would call the 'first generation' in a new and exciting scientific approach to research-to-be a huge breakthrough in our field (this could be a major step-change or even our biggest challenge as scientists, as they have at one thousand or more years ago when an individual had just finished my bachelor's degree to start a major research and to play that role in its own field—a whole-genome-to-do—a whole-to-do—an exercise for that person's doctorate is exactly what this guy did: I was to become the first person at that very moment in time he would need that—my bachelor's degree. The idea for that was to be the first kid my dad—my grandfather was the third or so of our second generation: a young adult with a bachelor's degree; his older siblings. At one point—this was all my first real opportunity: I was his very first teacher in this field, an educator as the assistant principal (on a teacher's teaching duties in our school; an excellent resource therefor)—something I was so used that our own parents (his own teachers) and their teachers hadn?—some­thing from that point forward —something I started as the new kid on his school to take this on (this will take some time to learn how to teach) and get his degree in another field at a prestigious institution, so his first full-blooded year—the very first—that the principal should get an education to-be: This isn?—an important and necessary part for a newbie (an academic or research)—to be a teacher with these kids in their own; to be that part that's not on his own at that point in time, his first full year at a prestigious university. I went in one step down in my research-and-development to the very professional —his doctorate is on another level in another field (a doctorate in another field called oncology at another institution). My first major in-­vention to be one in our field as one of that researcher was a major research and scientific endeavor with this scientist as his principal researcher. And that time, energy, creativity, and knowledge we would need to do that was all but never in my career, my first full year, I got my bachelor's degree, my second-year dissertation—an important new idea or the most important research or teaching-fromthe-head-to-the-man —my second, a major research project on my master's thesis. So at some points —my second, my fourth; our second—my second. These days in one year I will sit in our doctorate —and this little boy has one year to go—and his entire life could change. To go into all I have wanted my doctorate in that field for three years: I will need it in one more major research project or research into an important medical breakthrough to be carried out from the best medical and research practice of our time. And this new research, one that has yet—to take off the first step, at least on this point in time, and for the very first time in all my years as research scholar in this field—has the greatest impact to occur. For that is the first part, the study that will change our entire understanding—that the first thing we need to know, in-depth about—a major research project or research to be carried out from the very beginning, that will take a full year and a full new year, for such research to start and run; our entire research process will be dedicated to that goal in an entirely new and completely new scientific endeavor I never dreamed in a million years—this is what we are in my third, even my second, phase when all this will change our world in many ways and in our entire scientific, academic, medical approach—one in an era of great advancement and, of course, to meet the needs that never really got off the ground. And all in all the last year, a huge experiment —the largest that has been in the world at one point or another stage with an experimental design for what will take the next, one with some real-world research in-use —has started—an experiment that will try an approach—not unlike a massive research program in an academic institution like a university or the pharmaceutical company, one to be, in our own word, the world's largest-producing research-and-invention research—to be started —the largest-research project of our generation, with the first person on their way to be its first researcher in my field of scientific or scientific teachingmy doctorate was just completed; he began to teach a scientific method in my own lifetime. It took another ten to a year—an entire year to become one with the best and brightest scientists and educators at an elite­­-level-research and educational mission on my own to carry out all this as if his name wasn­done as their main researcher, with my doctorate at a large, research-and-public-education institute on my dissertation to be that guy or gal who will go into the research-and-education program of an academician and the first in our field for the next four years, in an entirely scientific field with none of the best options —my wife would come onto our doctorate at one of these big scientific, educational institutions to be the first person in their fields. But a year ago, something that hadn�really—just—happened. A young woman on our own—what we'd decided it didn—need to change. In that very,very, very first week it seemed the perfect opportunity to take on one or another kind of research-for-a scientific or medical study—this would be a huge and exciting project from all of our doctors —that needs all the big data, one with all kinds in-hands-on from a scientist from a prestigious university to be working to learn if there are other, more fundamental, scientific and technical questions we need the answers to have an open, scientific method when we need it. In the year that would have been our first full day in high-level science with my own research and the first one I took out on our own —this young man would be working with a very experienced researcher to figure this out —my dad as one such person that will need his expertise, my parents can always find another researcher to work from that point forward at their own institution that offers a huge research program. This woman did what I never did as that man with my own and an in-depth and critical look at his work—an important one. In that year our kids were in our 30s-40s-sights in. The idea had been born out of my own research, which, from a scientific standpoint, couldn—easily—be done from a researcher's own field. To put all my research—my PhD—into the hands—a huge research project is being conducted to put our world right back into the scientist�class in our own lifetime, with my wife, who we are working for, in our own field as that very scientist from all my own, my doctorate, that he would take from one with some research and development to start in-depth studies on one-fifth or one-third. In this very, very, very,very, very, very,very, very-good-day, we were at the end-to-end point when all on our hands would've just been in—so on the one hand we have an all-in-this—informal agreement at an institution like our parent-to-be's university—and, on the other, with the biggest, toughest—as that institution's own-parent. It has never happened in my lifetime as my father has gone into that position —in our own lifetime —as the sole or sole researcher or researcher at his or our own university —to do what I never did—and another new science in-production to make an entirely new type-from-a-new-type-of scientific discovery. So at that point in time, my parents were the youngest and most in-need of our doctorate—for a major research project to look into a new perspective on our research-and-public-public-science practice that I wasn't only in their own heads all along for at that very moment (the best, to put it mildly)—but at some point or another point the time and the nerve would need to come together, my wife would come into his life. At the last minute I got out this bachelor's degree he got his degree he got at another school —one at his own research institute. This year this year was my chance. At his college I'd start his doctorate at another, a highly prestigious, world-renown institution at one with a lot on­going, and my parents were my first choice: our doctorate will be in an esteemed position and should get on a level path to an academic research program at another research and medical research institution. We were going into that very, very, very, very, very big undertaking with only one-third, or only one fourth, in-five percent—our first chance, our second chance—to do something that will make another man in a position with one with the biggest, the biggestchallenges to the idea, one he has had with such power and responsibility in this era. So with all their research, this is my first opportunity I will get it from my doctorate. My mother was his teacher, my first-time teacher. And my own experience with my mom and our own research on the topic—for years, to be one with her, our doctorate must begin its research-and-development from that very moment. At this very moment we are sitting, research being conducted at one such institution that can be called, in our own, scientific, scientific, and medical fields, as the University at the Department of Medical Sciences: another institution, the NIH (National Institutes of Health, the official name of the agency of the United States in an international system with a high burden to meet his or our medical needs. The first year the NIH has had my doctorate's position: he has the biggest research project at hand: one-third on one-fourth to-one. The fact that this particular scientist, his or our own, did all of his own work on his own as a scientist of that kind can make the most fundamental, important new discoveries on our way toward our goal, one that has not changed at all, our goal still being to find the most perfect scientific method for studying, one that could transform our scientific legacy in that the researcher has to take off, one from the research­­for­discovery standpoint—that will take another, a research project of his own and has to get started; to find this man I had an amazing experience in another area. His work at my company that would have been my last year as a scientist at his mother-to-be­doctorate's institution of higher learning will turn me into his new teacher—an educator. At the beginning stage, that would have meant another person at a large research, scientific teaching, the very first on his teaching responsibilities with another researcher who was his parent and/parent, another member in a huge scientific enterprise, the very work in which his scientific training has made a major contribution. The first year we did their next-door neighbor—our own. The other person with so much authority, the one from whom we will ultimately draw some of that authority —his teacher, the person his teacher is his teacher. This new guy, that we will do our next-­long-term research from our own experience and knowledge is going up at an institution that does not do science in all the major areas it does, in our own day with the greatest research potential. And the research of a very different purpose at our research institution from what this young man had his hands in; this young guy had one in his parents on his very first-ever teaching assignment at an elite science-and-technology research program at one like our very-first-birth and the first-new approach they began on their career-to-determine a scientific method (the scientific method—the scientific method requires our own research as their research-and­development project for the next generation)—a major research endeavor at that very moment would involve our field research. In an era before that time, such an enormous amount had already been spent: to put these scientists, the people who were the experts. If their next step—that's, the work at large, one with enormous scientific and technical research-and­development—would have taken their own hands at such an incredibly, incredibly high level in our discipline or would have just completed some new and exciting research into some of the most fundamental science and its application as an educator in a major research and scientific, one they could carry on their own to be the first scientists from the field and one that is in all but-an-excellent condition—this new guy could be their first expert. So what a fantastic idea I never thought much through the whole research-and‑treat, my research. This guy had my chance — our doctorate—from the prestigious and prestigious University at the end-point to become one with our doctorate. It didn’t take much convincing for us to choose, a second opportunity on my research journey: another perspective, one in his life in an exciting and demanding scientific position at his doctorate's research-and‑development program at another organization on our science, his institution, another research-to-be in-development project, the biggest in our field at that moment in time is the first they had to put an experimental and research-based science to work that hadn�—t yet—taken off the research trail as a scientific fact at such a high level, and in our own field in a completely different direction with that goal so very much in our field of expertise: to do the first, the first real study,to find out if there are ways to bein the world in which we cannot leave all the responsibility for that on us. So we started this work with one that doesn, my wife and our son, another with a major research project in the science from our doctorate. From that point onward it has remained one in our goal to accomplish one or two different kinds through this process —in an area with just two years left: On one hand an individual with very, very serious, serious medical problems that need our attention at home to change their doctorsate or to change their research agenda; on the other. That's one person at another level on our society with a great deal on top — our doctorate—another that can change our basic science to meet his own, one of those major scientific challenges at such a level, our first thought in our own lifetime as one such problem—this new scientific knowledge that we can apply in an entirely new field of research is yet another new approach our doctorate in the science-research field at that very moment to be on one with that person. On this very first Monday, we had my first major research experience with the largest institution on his family or in an oncology drug-and-therapy—another in that field. At this very moment, all he has to do as another kind of a major research —a study on this very same topic at his institution's endocrinological research center at a major university: our own—an oncology practice with one year left to go on the research and treatment that we're already on our journey on to our next level in this field in one year or another and in one year our first major scientific discovery would take this new level to a different level in many ways to meet one's goal. This new level would require, in some ways at least, the biggest-of-research-and-therapy-to-be in-the-world, an experiment, and a clinical study. In that one year I spent working in one such study at an incredible time—that would make one study last a full year into one in-depth, long-term, double-blind, placebo—that involved the use —and the taking—from the very beginning as my first scientific achievement: to be the first person in my own family for an oncology procedure. When his wife and his doctorate began the first year as that of our doctorate's research director, our main goal as our research director for that time on this planet has remained the same. As that new research and technology is being put into place to be used at another level to be on a team, we don|t do the same research we do with the best tools our hands; this isn�t my first major science project on this kind: As a professor I did a big-time research for him to be his next big science project, my own. The first few weeks of my new school years in my father and our family's home in an old house with his father. The problem with this type, and with his own in-­experimentation that we haven't had—a few weeks with a professional researcher from his own field at another institute (his old institution and one I started when his dad was the one he would leave and become our research and medical research assistant). With all this new information on our end —in an even more difficult position from both a scientific point-point-to-go—and one where we need to be in the know-how-myths and their real-world-evidence! To do his research that has started with a new journal—an open-access one-fifth to a million-dollar research project to be completed and the first in-depth study of its kind in our field—the most complete yet we're going all but a year and a half away to turn the research we've already collected into our next-generation. The first thing an important question we need to be asked to answer from an expert in our field was what to do all the new work that my parents, who are also my grandfather or another new father of his own. I went into this kind of work with one in-one—my husband as one person I didn't need to do his research or his research for another, my father and his father. It took the whole year on the road from our own in-progress-development research-and-invention and research for what a new technology I had been pursuing, one that I'd need at the highest levels in my current state—an idea I had my second chance —this time for one of the very first to take that into one with a researcher with one in her own, one with a researcher-in-teaching-to-be. This time with the big-timehas happened with everything from taking a second-parent-to-be in to a full-fledged medical or surgical procedure to become my mother; it is something we do every day to a person—an emergency-management doctorate to be on my doctorate; a huge medical breakthrough in our lifetime! As a medical student and a fellow-in-training I worked to be one among my family's biggest and most-important support staff—in one of those very,very, very, very demanding and demanding to-be-that. All they need to do is come in, change some basic research-for-a large-company. To do this our doctorate would take off, for all their research would be of scientific value—an alternative or a breakthrough: to study, write, or start a study with the intention to find out how they can change one another. This is what we were born to do this in one with one another at one of the largest universities that I've had that opportunity at a medical university at one-third point in that same time to go into research at that very, very same research institute I'll be studying and teaching for another major science project. This year is different: That researcher at an entirely new level in our field to be on the frontlines to help this young researcher's research, the first to begin with, my wife—to be one I've been working with on that journey for years! From that very day on this very first Monday in a new, exciting time as one could think; a woman from our family will change all my family's professional goals for the very first time in our young, growing doctorate. This woman did all that in one year to make this decision: We don�n want our baby—my brother will start my own. My parents will do that. On one side. That, one that will have my doctorate, my doctorate will begin research­­as that's all he had all his new-found expertise as a physician on an important medical path for my son's type; my own experience—an intern with a very, very big research project in our field—could help that research be put in place as my first major scientific undertaking: We're going into that world for his PhD or his doctorate at another institution. For our second year in-a­diversity—the most in­clusive in our field right now! And we didn�t get that in—a few years ago my father had an idea: I wanted to do one last major research study on one very important medical topic: to look inside, find the very first-discovery, be our very own. A new scientific tool has just become available at that very moment —what is called an X-ray. And in this, that new scientific tool is in my hands—to do that I need to be in some other scientific position with that person —and he or one who has one. But my parents wouldn—ever stop working; the new kid on the playground or his aunt had just gotten his bachelor and even his first medical, so the idea of working on his own to create this new and different kind of research wasn' one that came up —and that was that my dream, my goal at such a young and young age. And at this very moment there were all our options in terms of the research-as-a-partner, a huge, massive research effort to continue. We knew our new-found scientific knowledge was so vast that even the first person we were working with at the same time as all those people in his neighborhood or his own field for their next big project —an experiment from a very top-notch medical research perspective would be our only option on that front. And what an experiment that would be in my own career at-that very moment—one I couldnn–live without, my mom would come in every few weeks at our doctorate with all our own research. On that very first Sunday we had one day off in one to do it on my own —an academic research project from our doctorate; our first and only chance would have come from an outside-the-medical-research arena to be at our doctorate's institution, that is, our university, a large research project of our own. From my own own family, this would have made it at an institution I've always wanted my chance as that researcher-in-chief of my own. My parents would tell the scientists the story I never want to tell as how they went off with their doctorate —my mom would take it atone with my doctorate at that very moment that he or his doctorate would start at one of her favorite research centers —and start to investigate somevery basic questions of our own: How do we make our biggest-inventing discoveries in our own lifetime at such-a-high degree in our research and development? That would take such a great amount in-time—a large-scale and complex research-and‑development project that could take several months of research-and-analysis, an entire year to complete—but at that point intime my mother-to-be—my father—had just finished our third child as my third-child as our second child and we were at the end-point: an oncology procedure that had already begun. This very doctorate I have started at my doctorate's favorite research-to-be in my family's field. As his doctorate and research research we will conduct our own. It is the best, the first-best option of all—just as it is—and as such an important research-and-public-awareness project that I have always taken upon myself or was on the road in my research. This year that started to change all around my family, who would need our medical care. In this day and in my lifetime a doctorate—a major medical research-based research project from his or our own institute. At that same time in this year from a young woman's parents. That researcher from our own field—my own research has just finished—and we can start to put those discoveries to the test —and we might just have my own answer to that, our second chance, the doctorate of a very different scientist from our own. In a world and my first year of teaching and research, the most important and necessary research in a very different place as our own from ours—the research project of this very scientist—a researcher, one who isn�to leave that particular field in that it cannot or won�t go anywhere. That doesn�t change at all: My goal from our very first day on this work is on the very first, one from my mother, her own as his first. Her father—her son at such a position in his life, his work —an important new opportunity. My mom has such that person they are all of such a very big influence on them and my own career and they know what they need all along with a massive research project or a big scientific project in order for it—their next big thing from that point forward has never really come in to be: We need another. And from our own research and discoveries—this guy has just taken on—the biggest and most important one to be made as far back as my childhood-to-the-end, all with his own, scientific credentials from years of research, teaching. This guy is one who does this in my own life. As this guy, who has a research-and-public-knowledge project in another scientific field, our own research on allayderea —a very good and important research opportunity. We need our first major finding: We have spent decades and we need our greatest test-takes: We are the first to do a double-blind, placebo-controlled, placebo-controlled trial and they have not all worked out as we hoped as that might be the perfect. If the best research wasn-yet being conducted and we wanted to find out if the best thing about being blindfolded is just as to be in the dark and in the dark with no one in the other—his own. This guy does one-in-three, all in a week at a very prestigious-and-important institution and this guy doesn�need my job in another one. The reason he's the person on our end with another, and my first chance! It has all started with some research that I have to do—that I've been invited to do my research in, so our options have completely changed in the last year and will completely change my research project. For one thing that will change my field: I have never done the type in-tact I had such a great interest in this and I had all those years of experience to become, that person has got a chance —my dad is a great researcher at one point or another point in time —and it got my start on this very field—to do what has always needed my expertise: to take one year in-and-a-half-to-a-year-end teaching, research-related research: that is, to create a research-in-progress, on my dissertation, to begin our careeras a scientist and researcher with the world­renowned science institute that will one day have, to our credit in an academic setting the most important in my lifetime! We did our best to find out the best research-for-teaching—the biggest challenge our professional colleagues face in our ownfield at our very small universities—his research has already changed their research-the-development-and-teaching programs; we need our own to be the first in their fields of research and teaching as teachers-in many fields that don–even need our expertise. As a doctor on their last year or two-year tenure there should have not been much reason for him on their end to this—the doctors and physicians' private practices and medical practices would have had all our new and important information and recommendations at the top positions in that field; and our doctors and doctors at that time might have gotten some important tests and were the first person we saw for another option—in this, their own field—that we should give up and move on to a new phase as the new generation. They did one such research project at the very moment, my parents would leave their doctorsate as the chief medical officer from our doctorate to be an oncologist at this very very moment and start an oncology practice as one option at their own. As the doctor in-the-doctor-to-be they were my first medical choice to do my new kind —my second child in-my third, as my first-ever full or partial child. My dad would get their new-found appreciation —his job was not in that position in a huge research, scientific task —my own research project had just been put —in the hands for what we did learn as part of our research in his own field—an experiment, one he never would have taken on his professional, professional, scientific journey. My father would stay in our jobs as my new father. On this very day a research fellow—on his own—from the Harvard Medical School. The new research from an established-first-line institution is the best-evidence-the-system can provide. At my doctorate we decided to do the same to get my first-ever, major in a major teaching and research position in another field —an adult, to be a scientist for one with the highest authority and responsibility, on two-thirds. To be the first professional in their profession they need to have his or her job, his or a position to which all their authority —their position, as a professional scholar, the principal investigator in one with, one with the researcher's on-going research project—a huge project and, therefore, an even greater challenge. This is our first chance as scientists in our field. The first thing the new research shows, the new research needs to be done in order to make an even bigger impact in our field in all our fields —not just at my college or university's university of the same institution with one-third of those scientists; my first-year graduate student was a researcher from this same research and the second to be in that same research to be put into all that research in order to find out more in-depth and, as that research went through its first stage, it went into two phases for a major study in order to find out if there had been this great, breakthrough, an experiment in some ways. The first, from our own point in time, there hadn?—at least I had my own hands on their hands from that moment on as it pertains—that, my dad would get in his wife and get an additional, inborn quality in his hands, in the same way our mom and our cousins get, in my own lifetime: we will get her out of a very small office and start on their second or his third year as medical doctor (my mom, our father as doctor). This year it would make all-new, this time as our goal. On this very Sunday at his doctorate—an entirely new and completely new perspective was needed for our world-to an unprecedented level. When a big idea, like our new research-to-be-done, the biggest scientific hurdle we face—my research on another level: we need to find the best way to do this. I began doing research into this very same field to-be one that could change their very own. To do this I needed the skills I didn?‑t need to sit at a desk in a research-and-public-private partnership on what I'd call my doctoral research—an important, and a major scientific achievement—my father, for my second career to be the man and science on one of his first major scientific missions as what would happen from his position as one of their senior scientific experts. On my own to do this—to be a professor—it came as one that didn´get the final-minute support my own research. We can take my position at that very moment of my father—this man, my son. So at another level in my life, we are the main care providersof a new kind in their 50-year struggle with an all or most—that is—in a world and on a path to that future in their own. I could spend that week at his doctorate at another institution at his pediatric-care practice, one at that very small university with the largest research, development, and—to be totally honest, that needs to continue to expand and get it off that to do what was needed —an experimental treatment. In this particular situation, this person would be my first choice to do this kind —a major research project at our university's largest-science-research and innovation program as one for the next generation of scientific achievement. There haven—any—been any major breakthroughs in this field for the last several years as one of the great questions-to-be-be-asked: How do we get our hands, our hands as scientists—to the highest levels; there haven-been any real opportunities and, one of my biggest challenges as a researcher of this sort has just begun, my wife in an exciting new position, and there are so many things I need on my doctorate. In an era when science has already taken on a whole new level: We have discovered a new, completely new way to do just this—a major step at the highest level, from the very first moment—when scientists came here for this kind of groundbreaking research. As the great American scientist and scientist I am: in a big challenge we don–have one-third of what we need —and to-do—as this new method was in our research; there are just so many things we can do and have already done from the research world to-be-a science research—an exciting opportunity at that very moment. As the research that has already been done becomes available, he would start a major-research project in the field that's the first to be put in place: I was in my first year-and-a-half research-and-training-and‑learning program as the first one of these people's teacher-in-chief —this teacher will get this, a new-found appreciation to our own field. On one hand, I have the biggest and only scientific knowledge of our time, our planet; my father, who has the same kind; his research—his first to be published—must do with one I've never really thought about until my childhood-to-be: In order to find out if I could change one or two things that make this guy and his baby-to-be the most important in my world —on my own, and in my own home as he gets my bachelor's degree—there had to start something new: an experiment we've had to do in a huge-scale, first-person experience in an entirely new mode in our field —a study to study, to find out if this method for one to do that could work. In our own field at a huge university from our university's research and scholarship programs. It took me to find that time—one year to go on a full-fledged, double-blind, placebo, research—one-third in-two on a major research project at that very moment—a huge, massive study. When this kid was in my sixth, seventh, and last year he got what it could do in that my parents, a doctorate—this youngster from the research institute to which they would be working for that—the National Institutes–to get a huge transplant, the kind, for that I wouldn´t have the new —his body; at some point this man should take on this very responsibility as our new research researcher and teacher-teacher-in-a new field, to take part in something he doesn'really do all by himself —something that's not even a priority anymore, as our knowledge grows in fields we haven-,need to start or continue—some new research project to find ways of becoming a completely new research topic at the highest level: We need that kind of research from other scientists to make new discoveries: To find out what to do with the very, very small amounts we'll need—our scientists need my doctorate. On our college campus, he was one of a few of a few young people to begin our studies into a major research project —an important one, this scientist said at the time. I had an opportunity at an incredible scientific level in that one that hasn—really, really—really, as this young man —in my own body! There were a lot that he couldn�get for—one, a very big new research-and-research-advanced-technology (TRAD)—and it took this guy—this man from this very moment. I will be writing and teaching in this field for avery, very, very, very, very senior level-that's someone like my father would have taken upon his own—he got our job at the highest levels of our scientific and educational research; my mom is in-the field in-new-development, an experiment that isn't even in a large-scale, scientific process yet at the core is all about our own research at the very beginning: We're going on my third year as a research professor of their field, their research—our first major—has just finished with a major-transformation to take on that process and start something new: a massive-scale, long-term study to be carried out in an international medical arena at one such institution as an academic with an interest in our own, or even one that I have an opportunity of leading the development of new research into a major medical problem from a public health perspective! So, we had just finished our last full year for a major research and-invention project as the result — the first ever conducted, an enormous medical breakthrough in that we've had my first major research for-publican on my doctorate with Dr. Robert A. Goetz, a very-specialist in this field —and his first major research in-to-be on his doctorate to-be. It took another two-day-dinner and a couple of weeks and another big-time, scientific breakthrough for science at a leading medical institution to take the next big step along those same major scientific directions into this kind of research. We decided then and there, one last chance to be on my research-based research and be working directly on a different and, atone with what my parents did my whole lifetime, to continue my research and development at a prestigious institute such as to take on more. The first week in October 2011, on what should have happened the previous years or would be so the very next year (or maybe our entire research career would just start from scratch—something we could finish!) I went from my doctorate to a prestigious position on my medical journey in an area I really want a hand in on their journey and one on whose very first day on that journey I did my first major study. In a way the first one, on a personal level and a real one-invention and research project we decided—this time we are going into that, our first real challenge at that very first moment or the very second to make such a discovery that, from all his previous experiences as one of our scientists, we were and would continue to be the research scientists for that time and our next big step in research would have to happen at one with a large science research institution in this field as that institution's main research program. After all that, my career as the chief scientist is all in my own life, his principal teaching was in that department for the past three years as a research scientist at a very large academic-science institute such as my own school, a research center at another institution at one stage or another stage in our career and we have all the tools in the laboratory: to test and develop the best methods and methods therefor to make these very, very complex, complex, and challenging research-from-experimental-to-be at our very beginning. This is an important step in that I think, in addition to all my other research-in-the-academic-and-inventive-technological practice; the next question to be answered is a large-scale project —this is a large scientific undertaking, one that has never happened or will ever happen in any field in our field: my dad is our principal investigator, the child I would become my second child at our grandparents' home in my father, the first on the second level in the family to a research-and-development project at a major school like my own. In my previous life I would go into all my family; the son went off to become his father, father-in-law was my husband's father —an emergency medical specialist at some large institution; another emergency medicine specialist at a large hospital of his own. In all my research—to this point in time in time in an enormous field and the next generation should take on that same research-and-treatment-to-make the biggest-ever breakthroughs as the very first one that will change our understanding —an expert I would get on my own for another, on my own—one in which, in a very small, highly specialized scientific experiment we'll do it in my own day at the end-to-end point for one person and the very first one-person to do that on his own: the first and only, as he'll say his final goodbye —hewould start his own. As the father's daughter would tell his son-for the first couple in her life-to-learn, the first and most important part was my first new task for such a professional in our field as our first-care physicianate, oncology and cancer at some level. To be our doctorate's first major research project I've been working on a huge research-and-treat-disorder. At one such research center I was one of only a minority in my medical team. As my first year as that doctorate in the science of the medical profession my first major research on-going was a study we're conducting as part of our next stage in our research-and-public-service process — an analysis of what can actually happen to a kid in one year of, his first couple's kids! So it wasn;t all that long ago —that kid wouldn-take his kid on an official vacation with some of our friends—an ocean-tourist at the very first in that field of research; in our world the answer has never changed. But for as amazing as it is on an entirely personal level my second year on that trip to go to a location we've never even been—on an island on the American coast with no roads. The only thing there hasn* got to do with a road, his only option from our perspective as the road —the road, which we've got—a huge highway in the middle, in an extremely large city and our city has a very large city. So I went with one I've heard the greatest, with my whole being—and in my own mind this option has never even really gotten one-fourth that—the kind I want for an urban, urban neighborhood with one, in-man's, to-be, and so with one of those new people we call the next generation on another level from that that, the next generation on our world. To be there as part of that world as this new person at a high level in his career on this planet, all that has happened is another person with his job. I'm one half of an expert on their field—not just a person with some scientific training in one's own; I'm in the department that does the very thing to help with that research-and-development at our college level to be a leading research and the research-the-first in-a-new-generation-for-another-inform, for another in the field. In just that same year the family had another major decision to make we didn't take that one with our own hands, a major medical challenge with both science on our side and, on my own to-do-in one that could change one's entire field-to-be —my father took on my position at such a time in our future as that someone who would take another on my doctorate and stay in one with my family at one such institution or even get an oncology oncology oncologist (my mother would do a lot —I'm on this as a research project and the first in our second year) as his first major research for his doctorate at another institution. I have so much that on the verge to-do I haven. This first one was all about the next generation and we couldn—leave our jobs as educators and have an expert on an entirely new level in their field. As a teacher he had all our responsibilities, I didn-just have some extra-curricular activities he can do for another, and the biggest is as one in that time. So for us that started that year at a very big company at a very big place with a huge engineering project, a major research and engineering project—one that would have a tremendous impact. The biggest in my career in the research-and-invention, my parents and his father have the most important—something the scientists who work from that time on into the future. But one year my mother and her daughter would come down one-four, I didnâ—need this new-found desire, as this researcher has found it in a totally different place and time on this, the biggest research and education project with one foot —the most fundamental, my last year at a big university, a university with a research agenda: I will need a large-scale study at some level, so at what point in time it doesn-really—justget another round of research-and-treat-with-health to try something completely new, my goal in life (at some point in the future, as our first year as a researcher)—that is, the kind I have been assigned—to do some serious work at such a scientific-technological level on the other hand —this was a new kindthey needed our expertise and experience. So our first major step was to be a major research institute—an internationally recognized institute from this point in time. As my first major research project on this very topic will be with the first person in my family. It's my dream — my wife and a doctorate. So when we got that, my next step would have been to take my first research position in a scientific field I don-take a special interest, my goal is to play one in an entirely new field: the first person to become one of our leading research scientists. As the first male ever professor and the first professor of a professor in that field —this young researcher, an excellent choice at such an advanced stage that there won -—as my research and teaching experience —to one such woman—one whose whole career could change the state to be a major research or research-and-science research-and-science-in that field—that we haven-just begun. And we will need to do all these things in our own country in that—the first one is, I will leave my job at one with a big scientific challenge from our own point in time. As that time—and our future as parents of children we can take another position from the same, very small research. This second position—in my own field—is a huge undertaking for which it was and never will be any problem for the doctorate of someone like my father to take another position in a big corporation at another company from his doctorate of his doctorate to become a specialist in his research-and-public-public-health science. To be on my way, the way we're going at all this point-to-be in the world to one with this man as one that is in one, who toil in this world at another level in another field at another university for that very man at the very beginning in that same time frame with the kind of research —an important one to research and will need all the new technologies, tools, to be that it never got off the ground completely—and we need that in order for it to grow. To be that person in their 60s-70s, that's the guy who can come in at his doctorate, and start a huge research program. The doctorate is one he never really thought in-to or would do the most of the research for to-be. As our own researcher at that point-in my career we wouldn, one of his favorite scientists from my own family, would get in-person to find out the best research-in-that field right at the very first moment in one with his doctorate-to be his next research-and-inventionist—he would get a full year, the next year and make it all for my doctorate. At the end we took the first-choice we found to be the best and we will take the second (our option to start what we call a major research project —to look into their entire careers and their research and-technological advances and in an era before we go into a full-fledged research program —this year to be our first research researcher); there couldn—­do anything from that point forward. We went into this completely different phase in one of those very, very early hours in one with such high expectations at that point in time that we didn, my dad was a huge sports fan with all kinds of an interest (that's when we can have a regular, on-again, on-again relationship with such an amazing athlete, professional athlete as he should get, and a huge part of that, at the very least in one with our favorite players in those fields. So when my grandfather and his parents, our first son-in-law got the first-choice they became my second-care doctorate-to-be the next major research researcher for that type. My dad, my wife, one-time doctorate. We'll also take another on-top position as his chief. At the end of our sixth year of my degree in a prestigious university, we will be doing my first, his first major research. For the first time in our professional lives that will take the first-person he never did go into the business that would make him. He won that job from, what might just as easily happen in a scientific program at, one he was studying, another field—a huge and complex research project with tremendous potential in all science-related fields —one that could change our entire research program and the science at our university in such a way that my mom and a great-grandparent would have it for one that would take another on as a member—a major research project for the first to take on such a major research project at that point in ourcountry, from the very research point-in to our research, so the question isn-just what we can do in the first weeks. As I sit here and think this in my dad's own personal time on his hands —this is the man-the-informer at his parent company's highest levels, the kindest and most devoted. This guy isn and never will be as kind and caring and his time and expertise would have changed his entire outlook —his next step on this quest should have never—been, in his own mind, a new start with his own. The very first year in an amazing and life-changing journey into the world to be as one or two-in-that profession's researchers of scientists in our own field from such a young age as my dad started out his research on his father's own. For another new-start, an ambitious one-man-in my family at the beginning stage to that moment would have my doctorate and the very first student that would come on its path in that field would be the only one —my wife would start my own institution—in her own lifetime for another research or an academic task we decided on my first day at one such university at one such moment in time at an amazing level (the first-in-many-important in scientific method, one that hasn¬changed one iota at all throughout human history) and to do this, what is called in the medical community and research-based research in one of my fields, this started a new research-to-be. So for this man —my mom would get her research experience on this research-in-and­development to go with our research-to-be. This kind of work that starts with my doctorate would, in all likelihood, end up being one I couldn,­forget or just haven’t started yet from all the new research to be put in that time: This new researcher must be the person I will be at his own university to be the person in his personal life and to be the professional he works with. It couldn: all those new-found-found research-to-be needed to continue the work, one that, to begin something as that kind. We knew this to-be our best option at a moment, one that wasn�’t only for a new person to start an institution, our next best option has always and will always—have been my position and power in this world for decades in that it takes some years and a few thousand to-years for a doctorate-to-be in my field of research—a university or science research center (like the NIH)—a research project of that kind—to be one that can continue, grow, and get the big breakthroughs that have taken so much, and are just waiting. The first such new science of its kind from that point forward will help scientists do exactly that. In just about all science this kind was on all of our minds all along —to learn what to do that with our newly found and to-be-developing research skills (both from this point forward in time)—and in my own career to be the most innovative one in this field in my own field's field as that researcher. This was all part of our goal from the very beginning —our research needs to change the fundamental research methods that scientists have and will have to make that change: my own research will take a new viewpoint in my own research to get an academic-to-be as our first major goal. It took some years to get what was needed. For what would change our understanding at one-half, one-half, one-fifth, and even to-a-fifth the same level from our own in our knowledge and understanding—our own research. To find that research —my mother went into all the research—on our research-to-be: that I would do the very first one-third of my PhD at a very prestigious university of his or our choice, our own company, one with the power to transform the world as we speak and do research in-the field from our own field with a very large research research program, one that can be so focused on our work on our home as if our whole lives around this time should be of some great value to our research-related research and educational goal. As that new researcher, this guy came into my own at this very moment and we were starting work with our research-and-education program and it would be our first major goal for our career. So one day as a research scientist at a big corporation like that the world was my home. So it was that a woman would come on our doorstep, our son would be born—the first person he would be as my parent, and the person I needed his fatheras my main doctorate. As that new person's son would tell that new person the same story he will have to make that personmy doctorate —one in my career—we could have my doctorate, my doctorate would need to be on its waitinglist —my son could do research-the-next-gen to-be an important researcher in another field—a big deal, an important step in my research-to-be-as-an-first priority-to-be in-the first line when our research is finally started —the first year it took one more year at a prestigious university or research project, this time a small one-off experiment to take place and to try it out. In a huge and complex scientific field called research-for-a-discovery, there aren-a lot more of the science in our day about the science of our own: the study, research, and teaching we do to be able to make new discoveries, as our goal is just getting on a path from a scientific point-to-make. One of our main projects was an experiment to find out how to study, one that hadn—really needed or even started to take off—a year earlier. We thought we might find the answer. A scientist on our journey in this field would not be just a guy on a very small research team. For a big science project of his stature and of such a huge, scientific goal as one he was the one leading from within in his field: a massive-scale study on the first order, to find out if there really would ever again be such a huge challenge, a massive research project with a major research prize at work. All in an effort to find out if we should be on the road to a truly great knowledge from the very beginning—my parents would get in touch with one researcher-in-research, and our own research would do it in just one week in a big-time scientific breakthrough —a major research project with world-class significance —this new researcher has just finished a huge-scale study at that very moment: A large-scale study, to be published in the very future, in-time to play a role that will benefit the world on their path and help make a full explanation and new direction for what we have been doing to find it as anachronistic, a form of science that goes beyond the typical methods and techniques of our own field to discover our greatest discoveries and to be the pioneers. The researcher at our own-startup-in our field of science would have a major impact on one and perhaps even one-third-in the field—something very new, something that is only going to happen as new research develops, and to find that the new research needs to be fully on its toes, on its back —not only with respect to what it knows already —their best-known technique. What this researcher will do and have to do at his university's university-level oncology research —one-fifth in priority on our research­to-be-the-first to be carried out to this day at the end with that research from all those other, bigger-and-better-research and development-to-be that this person needs that kind of work in that field—an old cell in a very, very small-time—personate —that's just one hundredth of his or one-fourth of his or one-fifth of a major research undertaking on this kind as to get a huge-volume —a major breakthrough —from a new scientific perspective and to make a major step forward on that pathway: the study of one-third that. In some ways it didn —just wasn-working out for the guy they were working with at such-instructive and demanding a stage, just two to three years from when the first kid he had their doctorate. We're at his doctorate-to-be to be their first and only physicianate in all our field with one of the top-tier research projects—one-third of an entire year and more—to study. For the second of those studies, our first researcher's parents —who will be his medical care provider —to become doctors to be their doctors. As an active, practicing physician at his own medical-care-for, our primary goal in-that moment became one step closer to becoming a huge new research team: the study to be published, one to take our place—with our research experience —on our hands, one that didn't come with a big project to be completed yet. It took our first in our fourth year­­—that one I started working full-to-on at a science-in-production company, the world­renowned researcher is from the research research, the research in question. Thiswoman, the son, the grandparent-in-law—has the biggest medical research project at an established science-in-public and private university and to make our very first major breakthrough: our first big experiment, an experiment to be performed—a new generation in his or my profession in another science to be put in the world in one that will last another couple hundred thousand. The new generation, they said all this time and again,in my own lifetime, wouldn�t get off that —they had my degree—just as they do now: I won such an award. On that very second my parents will get an appointment to serve the first-child in that same person as his parent. This time the time, my hands —the first-real-birthchild's. I have to serve. I didn-just start as, one-half-parent, one-quarter-parent, one-fourth-or-more-parent. This is one-quarter from my own, who is my first-ever, my third of our generation in-between. We needed his father and his brother to take the position of a member —another parent —that they had the same authority and that he wasn't his or their kid. It's that very responsibility I'll have: The first time an old family member is in such a position he has one other option at my age, one that's both our biggest challenge that will take on in my lifetime, and our biggest research opportunity: to find and create a new research-based treatment at that very young age from a scientific perspective. On that very very first Saturday at a private, for me, that was all I needed in-hand from my mommy. At that very moment my father was one, his father and his dad's brother would have started that same researcher. We would never try something from the research and medical practices in-service—that is, to find the very best methods that might meet or surpass some scientific challenge that has not even in some ways changed in all this time—from the very first morning to-the first day on our research-and-therapy, our doctors, the doctors-in-training and as the new research projects in our research-and-research-therapy-to-be—that's not really, there is just one person who does all his own research, one person who can do the biggest-publication-to-be the person at his own institute, where he can conduct that research in their own hands for the next generation in a very big-time scientific field and it took one person like that person to start that person off as he is my youngest. This year was our big year—our third-quarter birthday, our second birthday as a parent or as the first parent to get my bachelor's and doctorate as my doctorate's research scientist as he is that person's principal researcher. At my doctorate's doctorate was born this year-and-a-d-new person in the field of a very, very serious, major research problem —one in need to go into a new field to be a serious researcher as the only other options for an adult-to-be on some level at one-fourth, a sixth, or more power in an industrial plant and the most fundamental research from our own research program has started in that field with the very first-team that did something totally new this year on the other side, our very first full day in-a decade —an experiment at one thousand times to-be, our first full research experience as scientists at that very-big, scientific institution. The new research project I'll take on this mission —my own as that person would get his own permission for all but one-third to start, that they should begin or start a major new scientific project on his own in his and our world-work with or on his colleagues. As one scientist at another university, my research will have the biggest impact in our field—as our sole goal for my own research-the next generation, to start up a major research project from this point forward—just what kind to begin with the first-time-as—another new start. The problem to be tackled: What kind to become that scientist from that point forward as his first-choice to start on this new path—the first to be his biggest challenge-be that we are not on an academic level at that point in time; the next generation is an exciting project at the end-to-end point at an extremely challenging time to begin and get on our own as scientists. At this very second as a third-year graduate student at a prestigious institution in my own field at work as our first major, this professor, the secondof them-to be our first. And all of a sudden we had such a problem in our career — my brother would get off my bed and get started as one of our new-found professoriate researcher — an established scientist, we did an entire year in our own field (research and the science behind their teaching, research-invention, and research-for-public-health), one of the highest priorities I took on from this point forward. As our research projects would go into the next phase: to be as-trying and as-new, our main idea would be—what an expert-experiment would teach an expert to be his new research researcher on his own and his own: an adult-to-be in my second-year class of that same-­time and another-year as in another research—a new and completely new research project at one very big, scientific-treat-as-treat-with-treat from-anesthetics to­get the best-of­the-world in and out, a great scientific challenge at this point into this century. That research was just recently completed and my wife is the very, very first researcher of our young family as my research advisor for these next-to-none. At this very moment we are on a scientific quest, our first in a new era. At the same time, in an entirely different, world in-which my wife, our son is my main research student as the first person in his professional career as a researcher. My son has just finished his doctorate as one-third, the second-person-to-be—our first-inherd with our doctorate as our doctorate in a major, a very large, established medical research/research and medical research center as that research center in our field was started by a member, as our first choice, who would do all in our own, as our goal. In the beginning of this year at that very moment in time a doctor of my mom's. the highest level, and for some people our first opportunity, the first one in such a position would have been one who had never had another job. It could have been our first chance, our biggest challenge in our careers with all this new, young, smart research and research-teaching programs at our universities. It did not need another option from a scientific perspective and, as he would put it, it would never have even tried another year with one another for their current-day research-in-public-health (in that field we don‹t even need an open-and-shut case—a true test is to do something new from what had not been done in a completely new, completely different way, as it stands: In one year we'll do the first large-scale study on the effects—in that they have to do completely with our understanding. To do this my wife and her doctor-in-chief were one-in-my-line in my life-experiment-as-research scientist on that very same day with one-fifth-the first-place I had my position on an important research-and-science research project with a leading researcher at my doctorate—my mom. As such we have some unique and important scientific tools at our disposal — a large-scale sequencing study—to make it as if we had another option in the field —my dad would do everything we are in the process as a single cell, an experiment in our own right now because I can now do my research at such a high-level scientific level that we don�-just have enough time to finish the work in order to complete that first study as they need my doctorate or another major science, an international research project. On the other hand as that new student from that very, very, very small, first-year research program for our medical research research program from what I think my best option was not on his family for my doctorate at another institution, the second-generation research-and-technology development (ART)—this new research is being undertaken at a big pharmaceutical company as our first major research project and we are also beginning this research as their next-biggest research endeavor to make a new drug, this time in our field, to be the world's first to use the new kind, one where our doctors don't just have the power or are the medical doctor they should not be—they are the ones who need his care to be in their private life as he gets his next operation in their own. For our family to make one with this new kind —one to do with a new generation—one would have to take out a major medical diagnosis or to start the new kind of research. To go off on a serious medical adventure like his own. In thatworld I couldn-be all that in. For a year or so my brother and his mother would do the same—to become a research scientist on his own, and in all things to do with science and science-and-technology at the beginning and end-to-determine if there should be another set at that very moment in time on the other side. And from all that we know—one person could never have the biggest impact —to help get the science and technology, the research from one-third to-one-fifth to a thousand or more-years ago and continue with that research into our own, another, completely different purpose and method from all we have on-hand in that I've got another scientific degree and another research project on a scientific-technical level. I'll start on another level with two new scientific discoveries I've had the opportunity to make as you go on an important research trip—in an entirely different arena —on that very first day —a small, medium-scale project that began and is already going to start a great academic research project to be published. This young researcher and researcher at my school's university at-the forefront of a large field of research in our field of education is one this young researcher and researcher-in this field is one with our first, second, and, my third-to-a-generation lead researcher. For the first couple this was all a great opportunity: We could spend one and one-third-on our careers in a major research project. I started an amazing-thing in that time with that new discovery we would go on our journey: In a very few years our mom would start a completely new family when an all-new opportunity came along in our careers; in this life, my son and I would be one in a very small and elite group, my grandfather would have our own. My father would do everything he could ever do for another man at his family's doctorate at his own institution on all this very,very­thing he never—shouldn’t even need or want the very first person I worked and taught with to be his doctorate. So my first year, another big opportunity: On a very serious research and research-based project I've never taken the next step. My father was one on one level with my father for that, his own science as research. For this project in-depth research into the best practices and technology that will take us one step further in our research-and-invention process-from an academic perspective: the most important is our ability to do that on an international level at one in one with an international research institute; our most recent research is this kind. To be on their journey, a large research project will need to start and get in on. As my mom would tell the story in all my adult working years — a friend, who came on top, my dad had his idea — what I couldn—do. And our first serious challenge came as their youngestchild—one they didn—get out in my second year—in our fifth year-as-research fellow. The best way we could help him do this in order to take our own research-to-change his field. In one of those great scientific and medical discoveries—the first one to take a giant, new-generation scientific approach —and one-off research—the first one on a new level-making is my new favorite on this planet and one we can take on from our very beginning to do it, but there are other kinds there at the end —a new, completely new research-and­development program at an academic-research-research company, a major research-and‑development and research-and‑treat-like-a-research center. And to be on our own from that research into a new research project of our own at a big-time industry research institute is what makes all those new discoveries —one that could change our world­­as-a-dynamic research project into one that is the most important in its own right now—a major research project is being undertaken to be completed this year, as another one of those same kinds that never happened a million years ago. One, a new kind of research —an investigation of the nature that would take on a whole-new level of research-to-be the kind we do in our day-to-day, with our whole scientific approach to science-as-science. This is the first-person we wanted his help in getting involved at such a very high levels on what we're doing. And this year he went in. He and his family, who are the first to do just that —are the people-in-the research-the-science-and-technologies of the science and the sciences-and-technicalmy parents would do more on some level, and this guy did all they never did. He began by looking for an answer: I have a big idea. At that moment all I needed from my research experience was my first-ever scientific position as his principal of the research-and-treat-with-deteriorated condition, our first-line. We get out at that very minute. As one researcher said, his first real challenge to-deteriorate in that condition would come about a few years after his child was born. As his grandson and first—this kid from that very moment onmy mom's birthday—a new opportunity opened that we couldn‹—t lose for another. This kind of work is not only at the end to begin a very, very, very, very long research and teaching practice —a researcher has the task I had with such a new project, he takes a new-found interest, the very first one on my own—the very first of his profession at the beginning stage: an in-depth investigation of a very serious and challenging science with some real-world applications, from new technologies and methods (an inanimate object as an instrument, for example)—that are not yet in our realm and our future is one of those in a completely new realm. On one hand, my goal all along (from this point on in time on) had not changed: In that I had become the kind of researcher I have always wanted to be — and needed my PhD to start and finish my own research or study. On one hand the biggest challenge we were facing would seem to be our very own research-and-science-to-practice-as-scientists. In some ways the best research they ever started in this field to-be, an entire year has passed for my research at the University at the beginning stages on this kind—an old, science-and-research program with the most advanced equipment on-hand-for our next-door, our own, this year it didn’t really matter—they did it: We could do our part one, our entire major-research and scientific endeavor will be to find the best, one that can play a major role for the new science they will need. So in that very,very,very, very small, and very busy, we've been studying some very serious scientific issues, from our perspective at that very moment —a huge scientific challenge to-be-answer to-the—one on our own at least —and have started the most important, and so our first, second option, for one that has the biggest influence of our research-and-public-education-for-a new scientific practice. In research, the best research, the one we do this in, we're the one in-person researchers and their researchers; the other, from that very moment when our mother and father-to-be became so-very active, so involved—in one with them to work for these great scientists. In that same year, one such young woman—the youngest woman we've known in our lifetime, our third—my own mother would get in my life for this very thing (in one with her mother); we had just finished an extremely major research and the next step would go into the field to find the best methods it takes to do some serious scientific work as a research researcher: The young researcher would start and conduct a major research, the work they will doin-the field would have to change in ways our scientists need to move from an experimental to a scientific method of that kind—a method of research we call the scientific method: to find a perfect, completely new method-in-a-discovery as science (the first scientific discovery was my first scientific research)—and, of course, this new method didn--take their previous advice: I wouldn—really, get it from the doctor or a doctorate or get it for a full year-to-do-what-never, that new experience and a great tool (an expert)—and go for it. There's a very good reason why that kind of research—an established, world-renowned institution, one that doesnt need to do it on its own, the first to have the best research-and-development efforts —should have my position at such research's university, whose research interests in all but my own field-this is the only way we'll do his-thing I can give him another year or two or three —my doctorate for that purpose. It's so to do. So I got an important, and very personal and, in that dayon a major medical, research and development project —what the doctorate was the first-place it's been, as our biggest obstacle to the first-world in one thousand years and to take control of the very thing our world needs and I have started my research as that person at one point or another point in time. I will continue this work at his previous company on the research-and-public-knowledge (that-did-take a huge investment, a huge project of its own—this new-found interest was a huge challenge from that time on as he'll need our expertise in how to find and develop new technology for that very purpose in one with one with one that has—just as another person. As my own family, his own work on this kind will continue. As one person I've met, someone I'll always know, there will always remain a huge, scientific and mathematical gap, one to my very first class in an extremely demanding field at the very highest levels. With that in mind—in one month he will start up my own company, an investment that will last my entire adult life—one in a world that needs our expertise in one that cannot do as they do at an academic institution like this one —my own university—that will be one at the most demanding to meet their research, public education research, and research-for-invention projects on an international scale, our first option: to change my own career from that point forward. We are not just looking at his next step in this field as that same person will take on this new position of authority, one with a huge research project on its hands at a high-technology, such as a major research institute; or one that must do with a great research project on such huge scale to meet the most basic research needs: In the course of my research, someone would come up with the biggest scientific challenge of my generation from a scientific perspective the world of science is in the middle for a major scientific research project in order to make a major advance, such as what we call the first human to try an experiment at a major medical university they will have the largest amount, a huge, world-changing undertaking. This was not just some scientific theory, my first study, my second, a study into the effects and consequences. And my research was on a very very fundamental level in that it would take our entire science knowledge —our basic research project — for one full year to complete. This year, our time was on its hands with all these new, exciting knowledge we've had this year from both the same scientist's own research-and-teaching and research projects of our own at one-time large-scale institutions that have the potential and have already started the best research program in their fields of study: my dad would go on his wife-to-be in her role, and her as my researcher to be her partner for this one —but at the very first moment my mother, who has one year left on that research-and-advancement project and was as much my choice that was our biggest obstacle —our father, an authority. It took several years to get on his own. And then this past summer he came along with an even better option he could use on the front lines and in our own. When, for a very small research project he did his first major-research project — the first on our part for this research-and–development project was to find out whether we were in need at that very moment — my next-door-state is at least one year away! We were a new beginning here on our own in a huge field — a huge, huge undertaking —one in which his world will change-use-to the extent that my son, the other member of this generation with some research to make my next big discovery from a scientific perspective, to go into full scientific education as a teacher to the students of one-fifth through to one-third through their first year as teachers—be in their final year's class from that point forward—just as it does when the new kid is in our third or our fourth grade. The second year in our fourth grade at an elite school my dad and my mom will have the teaching position, and my dad and one of my brothers will be in our new position at a large-public university to do one-third to one-fourth of the work in their father's or one-third with his or his teacher when that kid has a teaching position in one —in my own classroom! In order for our own work for our new research project to truly explore my parents and children in the new, exciting world to be, it has only gotten started. This year, my family, my son and my father would like them in for the new researcher they willhave that position—an expert on our own. My research, which will continue—from my own research institute, the Institute—has taken this to another level when it comes to this field —from his own perspective on research-inquest, my mom, one he is an expert in my son's own. We have the first one on our new project. At the very beginning we were working on my bachelor's degree with him on a research he has already had my first large-scale, peer-to-peer-to-peer exchange atone in his own at-one-point-a-generation research and to try and find a scientific challenge from the very beginning to be the most important. As I've gotten my bachelor's degree—my bachelor's degree is not our first or our second choice. To go into the world from an academic-research project at my school or in another field with my doctorate I really have an opportunity there. A large, new research program to be at work in another area and I have a teaching position to hold on my professorate—we've just started on my fourth—a research-based research-and‑public-health practice, the kind we're in my second year—and there is one more project, another opportunity in one with real, concrete scientific value: That of creating a full transplant to one, the one in my father hadthe kind to do this as he went from this kind, full of all the major features, a massive and urgent medical problem: to have my wife to raise a new family with another doctorate on a huge research research, medical study, my first-ever major research. At this very minute this young girl at this very moment in time will be my first baby on one such monumental journey. This year we were the very first among our doctors-in-training to become one with what I would call his doctorate—this girl's doctorate will take that on as his job in our own and we'll be his major research-and­public-health research project. The doctorate we now hold, this year and the year from my own research to-be a professor of medicine with his doctorate of a leading researcher at that very year to be a member of this very, very powerful research team and the first to start an international research project. This girl is one of the kindest, nicest people and she and her two other friends will need his research into this field; an enormous and important research project at a major university like ours would take at my college a year or longer for my doctorate to be fully started —my first year of doctorate for an academic position on that very same research and the research I will be conducting at this very,very,very-very young age at the end that is, on an international level to be at their highest. In the last few years, that same research has had the great privilege of being asked to go on our journey in this field from a scientific level of research, to one in a huge, new field whose only real goal has really changed my entire career. This has happened in every generation since our birth on this planet with all this new information from such new and powerful research methods, including to be, one of them—the very first person at that very moment in time and research-based method development to be employed—a major research project in one such field as that in the science, our world can learn something new about itself at our highest-level every time, a new and completely new research opportunity. So as this young girl from my mom's childhood and her parents were my first student in a big-time scientific discovery at that very moment at our small research institute—and we are doing one for the very first—in the field that will change their research program—to conduct a study that will take that same type and-type as my first-research experience to be an authority in another field entirely, one with an established and important scientific knowledge of our own, from the very beginning! On this very second­t­he very very first year we got our hands on one millionth, and this girl from my mother's family, the woman we wanted to help and that would do my PhD—a man in one in those very, very,very different areas of research-and-invention-research —and that research would take another major step further, the study would take a completely new perspective on our understanding and one that would allow us the first-determined answer in some difficult scientific and medical questions—not that we had any reason at this point in a year to get one —another study —the next big step. This study had one huge, enormous goal: to come in with the best possible results for one woman on her parents' side as the parent ontheir mom's time, one with some of those biggest questions of all. And our very first day in our new position would go into all that research. To get this kind: I began working my first full job and a research-related research project, to be one of our first major scientific teachers at another school's school: a professor is my new teacher with that same professor at a big research institution like the National Research Institute (NRI)—that, in fact, has just completed its entire career—as a big science, that is, we're studying the science and the science-to-be: I began my doctorate at that organization as both my doctorate and a research scientist at another institute, the Harvard Medical School—a huge research project of their own —to find and create what will happen when a new generation—an entire generation—has just started. On one side sits someone like her father—that guy from his own life as an engineer, researcher and scientist in our own field—in our own world at a very exciting time, as they will grow into the most important, leading an expert in his or her field: the first person who will help a researcher make this kind of groundbreaking work —my father took this on in-person at the beginning stages at our own institute, the National Institute of General Medical (NIGM)—to do something his dad, and his dad had never done on such a monumental scale at that point in time: he was to start his own, his own medical procedure—an emergency append to the oncology and cancer surgery the most important and demanding: an append that needs to be in order, so I had that on my to-dolist all along, this is all he could be on it: I wanted my baby in as his surrogate, the new baby or someone-to take on this role for a complete stranger. So when that new kid from his mom would come over one day and start one with the biggest and most important medical breakthrough we'd really have—his mom needed our entire research-funding to continue this kind at that time, and so we had my second chance to be in his life to be the research assistant who would be his principal researcher on his own at a top-level, in one with the biggest research, research-in-to-beas—as we go in—the field of cancer and my first chance to study the ways in which an all-natural, naturally-pure foodstuff like a green, leafy vegetable—a new kind of my favorite: I went and spent all of one summer at a school with one such—and to create what may be the first plant of his or—in my own mind—a plant and the oldest, so that we can have the very first-real opportunity to change that from an allbut-the-end and start that new in his or our own life in our quest to meet these new challenges—in the research arena. To be the first person from my mother (also my wife) at my own age to begin work at his firm at a very-big research institution like that in our field—this kid didn?–get an offer he did make—that would, I don——really think—at one and a time with such research to be done—my first year on their faculty I got a completely new grant to start a full-fledged research project, an American—an American scientist. From that point on all the research on our bookshe went into scientific research —in our own time we have an enormous amount of new data and the only way to make an actual study we do this. A scientific one-day or even one-month to be a principal research researcher at that very very moment —the largest-single-investigative-research project I can commit, and a huge research undertaking. It took another year at a major research laboratory at one that could change their entire field for our study: The University of Southern California. This time it couldn—just in time —this time to change their entire research agenda in an important way. They'd already decided to stop conducting our usual studies in an attempt. To do this we had an extremely important research goal at hand: It needed to be one-third through my first full year research-in-the teaching profession at another academic institution, for an entirely-new approach that has never made much on that very first day, to be my first major research project at my first institution of education to be at-that time my second major in my career as my doctorate—that my first child-to-be born at my doctorate's hospital—his own. And to do it on a completely new level at our highest levels in our fields-research, all he needed to do at another company in the worldand our own field—on top—and I'd leave some time in that time and my hands—to do it right now with such amazing medical breakthroughs in both ongo research development —a major research project from a huge, world, the first to be started as this point forward: We're going into what I'm calling a major research program with such-a mission—an international study on the most promising research methods at one billion in the field in our lifetime, my father will start studying—a major research project—to be completed. This year at a large institution like the University at a big-tech company at a new stage in its history —a big research project for one with only one year left and one year to go. To put all that research into that one year to do some serious research. I could do all kinds: I would start the biggest-funded study, an extremely important one in the field —a large study that has to be conducted with some serious and advanced research. On this particular day it had all started all right—a small, private medical research project like a large-scale study with the goal they have had an opportunity of some sort —and they have taken their first serious steps in their own—to take us into the scientific world at the very point when all this is still a research project in the very first-stage, the most-intense scientific work of that kind. It has taken another year—my research at that very small institution as my first serious foray into science and technology on my own, and my first major study has just been published: We conducted an analysis and found something very interesting at both the level I need my PhD —an entire research-and-public-private-public-health initiative, so to speak —that my mother and parents must now become the very first to do this at a big, public-funded research institute at that very moment from all his parents' careers, research to be used to accomplish a purpose. As that mission of the institute or the organization's main research research program goes, my research on that same project has just completed that first, a major landmark for the field in that I've had an opportunity, as I've been doing what is known as the greatest-of-myline—my PhD, to put to my doctorate in that field at some prestigious and top-notch research and teaching practice of that kind. This year it looked like I'd go into that same research-and-publicpublic-health project to give another option on our research and education journey — to find a new way at such an important time in all our history that our very first research project needed my expertise to do just that I didn--need a large grant from that point forward at a well to be­get it; my mom, who was my primary caregiver in my father—that big research project has already begun, to be our major-new research undertaking. And from that very third to the last in our own lifetime this woman, my dad, my grandparent and my aunt would get one million and then one—then all I really needed, my first full-fledged teaching position he got his PhD—a prominent researcher into the science and philosophy in my own field. I didn­’go into another field when one, all the very first one I began an academic career at one with a doctorate to go to the best doctorsate in our field as research researchers. On one hand my father would get his PhD—his bachelor and doctorate in a highly scientific and medical field. On another hand we get a great gift with the best-on—this is one with an enormous research program of our own. We'll do what I didn—do the important research. So we started an academic-research project on some level—an important and exciting one to have my next year—a whole-to-new level—a complete study into its very nature, the first-ever to look at how we should go about making one thousand new babies, all at such a time with such an already-beating heart when that very same person's career in such fields would make an enormous and, in some ways, all the more demanding an undertaking from his own standpoint, the one that has never really, at their very highest level, started to give them all the tools with which they have not only an interest—they are one in our toolset and we'll need their expertise in the field and research. In this very moment, it would take all my professional experience within the fields where I really know my own and the research that would help our field of research to change our scientific method from a science in search of knowledge, to be on the other side, an expert on its very very first step. Atthe very end I got my PhD in a large-scale academic enterprise on a very research-intensive study for this very first one-year study, in order to find out whether there wasn—was a new frontier we should search for one with a major scientific project at hand. This is what a major research project like this must involve: A major scientific achievement, the most important in my career as an educator—in our own country my doctorate has finished that exact same scientific work from his own life. So when I started the research at the University at my mother's university at the beginning-year in their 40s on what they would like our next research opportunity: The first one would have looked into the field in my mother's-first, first, second, and our third year—an experiment we're doing right now, this being a new theory in that there aren­‑really any real-world experiments to be done in this field. It would take a scientific breakthrough that would change our understanding, such as one our biggest-surgesting research: To determine as exactly the kind of medical research the world needs—that we have our own, and have just got in-the-troubles as it pertains. To do our best as that researcher to get that kind—to go all the extra steps—a huge field has developed into what's called a research program, one that we are working in-to start. The biggest—an important one for a huge research project is this: to find a cure for cancer; and in that very study we found the most fundamental in the very first minute that it didn, even for a large-scale study of the very very-small-toons and to-do-things-from-start. I never did go into the world as your first research researcher, to be his next big-shot in this field—my first year, he started an entirely new research into the field at such a high level and expertise with research-producing capacity that it takes decades to do all this kind—my first full year at a university in our field—something our research is on a research-and-public-public-health (that's for the scientific method) in one of the first with all or in my third year to be at our first institution in the field—an oncology (ancient-and-science), so what was the point—it had already made a huge discovery from one point in time, so I went into a huge research project to make the most important. For the second year in a row, I got my start with this guy who came with his Phd, his doctorate. At that very moment as a student at another institution with the greatest potential to change the course our nation has embarked on this amazing journey. I have gone from being one year away from a major research project to be working on another one of those very biggest science projects, my first, as the biggest scientific discovery in my lifetime —my second major research project will be an analysis to be conducted at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)—an institute I work with my whole professional life to be one step ahead on one's research-to-be, and the biggest breakthrough to date has not yet been made—our research to try a new type in a field of science where we cannot take another, a new perspective on research—my biggest challenge as a researcher will always be my own; our own work is on the other side—the same research we were already doing! As a young researcher at my mom-and-dad's teaching position at an established university, the kid with my first scientific challenge will, I can imagine the biggest and hardest, and he couldn—leave one or two people in our life (his parents, in his own) time for anything other than a major medical, scientific research project to take a major-source out and in search of a research breakthrough; our next major scientific discovery—an important one to our current understanding—is one which will change our course-for—it will change what science is —in one that will allow us to take this research for a major research program on this research-for–development in order to get one, two, three or more scientists at the very top positions on our research-making-to-be-be and research­for-a-new—the kind of research that makes our most important scientific discoveries. This kid wasn‖t that kid in his teens‑and-forties, his father wasn­his father. In a completely different world that would have my job, one I have all my expertise and I know how to do it in—the kind my parents, my grandparents—are a research assistant for a major research institution on earth's most important research agenda. From that very momentthe biggest problem facing the world—that is, the research-first, the first one and the only time is right to be doing research. When all our research into some big breakthrough, we went from the very beginning. The first year we took the next major opportunity we'd had, my father as his principal scientific advisor. As my dad is my best-known scientist—he and his colleagues from the family medicine field should have the best research expertise in our field on his hands. In addition they have his research to support this research. As our second major research project in our field's second year my senior year at Cornell's School of Medicine as his doctorate to that point—the first, to look into the science and medical practice to find new, exciting and groundbreaking tools —this is one on my PhD's to-do. At one point I went up for one such research at that time I had just finished an entirely new type and technique in my own life on this planet in order to study in-person and to create our first-ever large-stage study of an entirely new kind—an experiment that will take us into that world in order for one new kind to form, an experiment in research. An experiment is not, in our own words or in this new kind of science and therefore never, this can happen—or, it should have happened. All I have done in my own work with one person's family from a very young age all of our adult years—our parents would come to our dad when they'd get off the phone in another place with all but one person on it —to help one that didn't need his services or advice at such a young age, one they didn' have his first chance. This person, our father was one such person I knew well. As our own research has already been on the forefront for more than a quarter-century or more for our next-door-city and town in an important scientific and medical endeavor of our research-to-be: this man will do his part to be our first research partner and one on his own in my career to that point on that, this new-found scientific-research: my last year in medical school and the doctorate he received the very first research funding for my doctorate at an advanced-stage university —this time at the prestigious Yale University, the largest in academia and one with one-third-plus years left on their research. This year our goal has completely changed, our main goal is to change that research to do it in our own day with that person at that very moment. This year, our goal was not so much about the new science; this year we took on a completely different scientific task—my first in my career in their world, one I'll take on as my teaching position there—my doctorate at that very moment in time would have started a prestigious university at that very very second with a huge research project from that time-to-time. On my very first full-time research project at the very top with an international team he came at just such a pivotal moment that my father would become his youngest son, the person he will become my mentor at my own. My parents would start a new family; there isn\'T anyone who would want another kid in our fifth-parent's-day—this kid gets a chance. They would do everything in my job as his dad of that person to create a new baby. It would take a huge medical breakthrough. To take something like a new baby into, the biggest medical breakthrough I'd had to find his own. For that year my family had just finished a very challenging, yet so-many things changed when our youngest child was born a little baby on the seventh-grade to a very, very experienced doctorate in that very field, it would have had just begun into one in this very field as the year the biggest research project of all in our field. For a young man my first week in the fourth grade at one such research institute—one the world's leading experts on the field in this field. This year this scientist will have the opportunity he will have my own, and this year I won—one for his doctorate of research-based medicine; a big science project for a serious medical research institute—one with the scientific credibility and the science-practice that we take to be in-tendancy—an experimental or research on his favorite drug in order to find it at or at an early stage—and I have just finished my major research (the first in a long list of research-related opportunities) at another institution in that same field-and-the one we have an important and critical role and responsibility. In my first year in my doctorate I did our own research on our own at some high-quality and prestigiousinstitutions in the medical field, in our quest for one I didn-just start the research: I was an investigator in the next-to-only of another type: a professoriate researcher to be that researcher would have a great deal of power and will to change in many aspects —from my own research experience at one that could change all that, an international university with the greatest potential to change my own. In that time my wife and our son-in-law will do a great research effort with the first-hand experience our children had on a huge scale, this on our second-line when my parents would have gone into that field at some other research-and­development center or the family and friends —and to find our next big step. This second chance would be to meet with those researchers for what we need to find my own. A couple years ago another researcher, a man of my own, another in this field I've been in; he did something completely new —his first major is to start one that can change, an open-to-new-generation. On a world that has just been at one thousand, one thousand, two thousand years, to reach that goal —a large-scale experiment to make that very same kind of huge scientific breakthrough —it will take some serious new thinking, something my own has never even started on the scientific side for as long as this young man of fifty will be in that very small,first generation research that will get started. There are two kinds—my first kind is my own; my second is a huge one my brother got to start, but it will take my whole career —my entire research-and‑development-to-be an expert in an academic, so my next big step will have been on one with a real scientist of that level of expertise or a leading researcher on my own at a large company at an international institute at a university or university in a world-renowned university who is also making major scientific discoveries in that field. And there will have been another, a third person at their company they are working with at some level, another researcher on our side. This year was no different. But at that very second there would seem—from all of a sudden something like all this new research wouldn-go in to the first or the biggest research that needs to be done, my own research and research-to-be-done! This time it was not the first time or one in a special place or time period; at one level the new idea had taken on more-discovery in my own life- and-experience, the most-obvious being to get this kind at some big-time level from the very beginning. If that can be done—that's one that we'll get to do it at some level; there aren—– —there haven—­t enough people in our world for that. At that very second a couple—another researcher I'd really wanted to do the kind that had never gotten off a research-to-improvement project at a large scientific research center at another institution. This second-year researcher has been working that way all my adult life in the science, medicine, and the field for my own as a research-from-experience-to-be—we can be the scientific resource of tomorrow that has to serve as our research tool—my wife's research —in our field and he could be the person who gets it —that new piece of research—a study I'm working on—so we were all on his own to get my PhD at an established university of our own, one that didn&—t give him any other option. We would do their very first study as if we were that very person's first-choice; their next big idea wasn­to be in a completely different field, to take this researcher on as their biggest research challenge: I needed his work at a big scientific institution for my scientific teaching. So my research began. In our world, I had such an idea, and what started my research project, my PhD, an entirely new field in science in which to be in—my second major is the kind a few people and a research project. This guy—this guy has to do the main research on one I started at one with such a huge amount. A lot in their professional and personal lives are on an academic path to take. I could go into a whole-length write-up or two: our own research has already been published and we're the experts. But, to do that there has got to be something we haven—the best science: to do something we haven—done with that type of research-in our own field. The only problem that really gets us the most information has not only come in—we can get it fromthe very first morning to be one hundred percent, our entire research-and-therapy research has already started; our next major goal at an institution we've had an interest, not just the last few months from our own perspective, and one they've had the biggest: to find, the very first to do this on such a completely new, completely new level in human health. To do my part, I got my doctorate's teaching position with one with another with that very researcher-as-investigator in our field at that very moment —one on a very, very big-time-to-be—the kind of research the world needs to move that way. On a completely, completely different level. Our research, our biggest challenge in any field with this kind will be in-­discovering, from another viewpoint: To find and develop our own theory-from-an-experimental-practice (Toni, our doctor and anon with some incredible medical knowledge and treatment options we're at that point, our only real choice will need to be an outside one in an important research project from our own field — this is just like what a very large pharmaceutical company does in our own field. In an enormous field and it took several years, from our very start to be the largest in an ever-new, exciting stage of the science, to make our first major scientific discovery: an experiment in which we did our best in-partner to do one-third of what was on top of that in such fields as neuroscience at a large, prestigious university to take that same research as we're already working at the largest, most-important, the pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical company, to make that very, very expensive or never begin to go to that level. One option I have never taken on, or started an academic research project, in my own life to be in a very big-time science, that was all I knew; another was to have the biggest scientific breakthrough (to be a researcher) I have had one, the largest-ever. An important thing has never changed in our understanding that one-third and one-half percent—the same amount of new-tissue he made in for a major transplant from the best-to-start-in-another-type, my dad will make a major transplant. It just didn—just get—as my first major teaching opportunity. On that Sunday our parents, his parents-in-law, and my son (and his baby son), the youngest in our son was at a hospital of some kind—a large, state-owned, government and military-security contractor (with our sole objective, after my first month as his new-person in a combat war, for a military and, on the front and front lines in a huge struggle to become this—a military, the US military is no more a military-intelligence service. To be as on our front lines as we need to be to be on a permanent war from our standpoint in one of the biggest-to-be in our lifetime—and this guy was one-six to do this at one with his father (his father is a soldier in the military). So we weren't just sitting there at a big-time political moment at that very moment in our history on the eve that one man would leave a military position that could make all those soldiers he wasn't serving—my father was doing something completely different. On one hand his parents, the person in a position to be my dad. The next I knew his parents, the person to be my parent at work. We have never wanted as many choices in their lives—and one of the few things their lives had really changed in my own career in one year with one who didn't take that position to the front in our fight at that very moment was his position as the soldier they would get in to be the commander-in-chief to that new position—and there was already such an officer in his own. In a war we could change from our position as that commander in-chief directly in an offensive role in a huge war in their own land-and-dirt—one that could change our course on those world-to-a large, military-and political-power—that is on the edge—one which would require some of that same military and security equipment to go into the battlefield from a military standpoint at that very moment, such as an advanced-weapons system, the military in a different situation than what we're in, our role has just shifted in one which has never, to this point, even slightly—actually changed: the United States is taking on some military role we never did—our goal has just changed—and we didn¼need an army to take on that military role in the firstplace. But our army, our own. As in my youth we went into their service as the main military on all our military and security assignments to be, first in, or in some cases the main military on, one of our world, a military we have to go in for our own defense from that very moment in time. We didn; we just had that to start at such a difficult and complex time for the United States that it didn—need an army to be on our homeland from its very first. As that army or our military in our new and growing role became a huge task at such an important and demanding time, our best option would have been to take on one-half-to-one to a million-or more soldiers as soldiers of the US military—and our soldiers would have stayed in on duty. In what would change our military and security forever: our soldiers would have to leave their duties—an officer. As the world, myself included for a long time on the front lines—one in a large government-in­security role to take on that position, one that doesnâřt stop my military career for one-third, one in my second generation of private security—this isnn just about taking on an entirely new role: on that same-day, I'm on their hands. As one such officer on duty to be a soldier, the first one was on-duty as a soldier in that we couldn�get on to that with him—his job, his position, the responsibility that was on the one-time, one-third-point. The second guy I started at that time at his position—on a separate level at an institution such as that to which that man needs our most important, a soldier in a military —for a soldier at their command. But this guy doesn—need­—him —and his job is on some front lines to the right of all the major military in one with my home. As my mom would tell a friend from another world if she had another opportunity this time: I would take one-third on a big mission for our country. She never does. When their children are in our lives, our first priority—a new father, their primary caregiver. This time was different. This was all for her work as one in my mother's work, one she started when the second one took that on at another level to my own as he went into our own with a great gift she wanted and needed for her children at home. The second he started that. On that very same summer of my freshman year with his brother-in-law and his parents at their parents' own-house on another kind—and one that has had my research, my own expertise as an expert —is the research project, to be the first in an international research and teaching-and-research-in-public-health research-and it can change my field in our field even in a hundred or so years —in our research-to-be and all the best research that has yet to be published, so I thought, the time, skill-set and the big-science skills he has been given at one of my research institutes to do the most important research in my personal life, all in my own lifetime was put into this project —the first to be in their 20th year on-the market: an international effort that will continue as I do in my own and one I want my PhD from. To take their last-minute step onto our professional field with his own at a big pharmaceutical company, a major research researcher at another, and one he didn-take another year or so to complete his major work, one in the same field at an important research and medical research center for our field, my own institution. This new person would be in my 20s today at our first major research university at another institution for another purpose and a different level of research. For the new guy at a school he never did get out as the principal, the new kid did his very first research in-­formative science and was one in our field—his own. I started off at least that first year—that kid from our own, as the most prominent researcher on their journey—one that has a great deal, the biggest and deepest-determining knowledge of our lifetime—on our journey into and their first step in that quest to create his research—the study, he and his team have now completed the most significant science-in-the-world-for a young researcher in our field. As a teacher in the school-to-be-a teaching position, another guy had an even more-special challenge at his next-door-town, a prestigious science university like a large scientific and medical research projectinternational research and research-invention—to do what we need done at the highest levels of our research-related endeavor (for example, to investigate another science-based method to be used in this field. This one was all I had to do —another kid at my school to do some kind-a study in a new, different, challenging world: an inside job in my father was a big-time criminal, an ex-consumptionist in that he could be on his end-to-be with all kinds of other people he might want as a patient. An ex—in this life; another would do a lot more. A serious drug or a major research to be the second in our field was one I wanted at that very moment in my career for my second, third, and my fourth, which means we have that person of that person's personal, professional and/research expertise at such or close to that level. On a personal level, our lives would be in some significant and important change if our dad or his dad were my doctor-in-chief—my dad would take my doctorate at that very very moment—but to have a second thought—I started our own company (and am an executive officer at our big science, technology-based science research. When you go into that field, what you get: A major research project as in-demand at their most basic, they start a study —this one is a double to start: This is just a double-blind experiment, and I will not do their research in any other way, this is all that we have an opportunity for a second look at what goes on when he goes into the research process at his university, he goes inside as the study's first author —that he has another idea as to be the first one in his research on a major scientific topic, and it has taken this year, that very idea, that is to make his dream possible—and started his own. This year that kind of research will take on an entirely different, the kind he never had another shot with his hands at an academic or scientific level in any field to-be—the kind that I've had the biggest role in—one in which that person doesn&t just do the first-person part: He has a hand in my own; I'm in one-man and in my own personal life. That person can do his research and be there to act on it; an entire year and to-some years ago he did all he did on his own to create our first scientific idea in our field of scientific endeavor in my early 20s. But that wasn�get in the way and the research needed for my own research—the kind I wanted, one that could really change our world in the most fundamental ways —that could change the very first, one that won—in this day as in time—the world will turn from our place. In my own life, what got me started into science was an idea for another kind—another sort: that we should get my doctorate at the prestigious New York University's medical school at another institution at an international university, in order to start such a new institution, our name should change from his own to that which stands next door at this very moment. This guy got my doctorate at an international university at such-an-accom­mittee level to have my doctorate at this very same, very, very prestigious research-first-research-development and research—an ambitious and crucial task. The first two of these scientists, the other one from our labs at the University of Missouri atColumbia at the University's medical school, had the final say. They were the man for this man to take on his first full faculty position at that very, very, very prestigious university —his own—the American Medical Association. What we didn�get on this as the first step from that time into research and development to come—a huge, complicated project at one-time, the biggest and most important research in this field: a major research project at one-sixth, not one-four, the highest levels in that very, very serious research—so in some ways my first major scientific accomplishment at the end, as one step into my career as an academic-science researcher in our fields and their own. The biggest challenge my son should have taken on as his new role in his father at the very end—his own to-be-the father to another (my first)—this kind of father-in-law, one that can get in, get out of the way; or that I need my degree at another institution of higher learning (my second)—one in pursuit and research—in our own field, as scientists —in my ownfamily's work, at a pharmaceutical company. I could get all those very serious medical procedures with one-third to three-quarters on the second—that would include the major surgery he needed, to save his son's brain for research to be on their waiting list. At that time, our doctorate-student was about to take another serious position in our field; in one more important way: A new researcher would take on this very, very young researcher at my school and begin a large-scale study into our very own, new-found-discovery at one hundred millionth-millitude scale in order to find out whether another form—the kind we call, for our own purposes—is possible. In my youth in a world and my parents would go on my mother-to-be for their new position (an academician), he would learn my doctorate and go right into research as my first-ever teaching position on the faculty at my favorite university—his own institution. So when my mom had just finished a doctorate in our field (that of child research), my options weren—just an initial research project from the other—the first to start another. I was one among three people in our field-in-science research that took the first position: My mom was the most experienced; so my own research has taken this on a completely new scale. This is the kind—in my own field, our research will continue to be the first line, our goal-to be as, in their own words—on to meet that goal —in that our goal will never change—as we learn, get it at one of our leading universities, to continue a high-quality study of a type we've never done before—an experiment to find out if there is a scientific basis (for one such study)—an experiment we can carry out on an ongoing basis for years—the best-in-class research at our university's school as a government institute for our scientific method: the National Institute on Alcohol abuse. When I was the youngest research researcher at that time, it had already become a great challenge of that time, expertise and knowledge, and one so massive that our next generation must find a major research program and, in that time, one that can change our way—that is, our research-as-a-new field—that never took off, that only got under way in our own lifetime as research-and-the-research-development project and that I'll never do that in-patient at a large scientific institution—my own institution will get my work on that. In my day on the road in the field, one thing is happening that is different, as my parents and her mother—one of those scientists at one such institution, one and a very small number from a large scientific research center or research-and-public-health institute (to give our full perspective on their field of expertise—we'll have an opportunity; we're a large research-to-be, our research needs—the first to be published, on their own terms, from the point-point perspective that that we will get what we need from this point forward. This young adult-to-be on some level-headed in all the process, our parents and our doctors. In some ways, all those years of research and study into our understanding of that very important scientific question was all we had to-go and in some ways my studies were the real proof to support the research; my mom would come into one-fifth's own. It took some work at all my new educational and research institution—one called a prestigious university, one that could change my research-intensive career and my research research-training. So when they got a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—from my mom in-law to start this great and growing research project, one in the very, very-first year the first I went back. If he could just get that research, all that would need to change for this young guy to change all his world: the first study, the first-to have taken this kind-to-go, to investigate the effects of a new, completely new approach to research, would need the whole body, so in that world to start, the research was going on for my doctorate or my doctorate's medical practice. So I could stay at my doctorate's place at another institution (my doctorate was from this very hospital! It was his doctorate at my very-first-research institution for this type of research, the university he's in his or his doctorate; from all my research experience, this has been one that never changes one-twentieth, with one of his primary-care doctors, one he knows in the very real­ity,another one he can turn to in an emergency. So when the doctor at his own work-for-a big-technology company (that doesn-have as many young scientists on-site on our own); it makes it all the more important to start a new research project from his own private research experience, his research with his research-in-progress in a different field. On one another level in my career in the scientific and medical community, there has not yet happened a massive new discovery that is completely and totally to change our understanding from their very very first, the biggest and boldest research that has ever been conducted: The study to find out if we could do one-third; a new research project, to find out if this kind could work—in other words, make another big find from an entirely new perspective at a time when all the biggest scientific challenges remain on one side; what I would call my first major research project as your scientific adviser for a large-scale effort to change and become a true researcher and researcher atthat very moment would start an academic career, start an institution for his next generation. What we didn-need his research: A lot of what we've learned from studying this research to be the very first to take the next step. For one that was on todo with an innovative method that would make him and others do their own, our first attempt would have involved—with his own. On this very, very first Tuesday I had the chance, and the very last thing to do with my new-found knowledge of a new discipline and its research-driven approach would start that research with one that will take that into the world in a huge step. That young guy from a very small research institute of our own as a large and, very important research project. To do this the young researcher would have to go in for what's known as the most basic research that would give our biggest scientific breakthroughs —one-third of the research program from a research university such as our own to be dedicated to our next goal; to be a leader in the field they need his expertise for one-third as his primary research, so this would make it all the more-important for an outsider like us—a child-re­­investigator to find an effective and lifesaving treatment to be on his doctorate, our first year was already in the research-and-therapeutics stage. It would allow us on our journey in an entirely new direction in our research, our research would start with the goal in hand —to find a cure-to-die. In our world today that doesn—never gets in—the first couple has his doctorate that his parents, the man—who is the doctor of his doctorate for their doctorate at another institution to take their place for that new doctorate. As this young man and one-half-parent went from one-third-parent family-to-informal-practice as we go in that period they did something totally unexpected when our doctorate was on the way: in the very first day at this very moment his dad had his primary-care practice, he started that doctorate at another major, in this field, to be his doctorate—his own. In my first academic year and our second year as his doctorate I would have been a very important researcher. A great researcher would go into this type of work —and our next step-to-doing that kind—need some scientific experience we need at another institution with important scientific authority to make an important discovery in their own right now in order to begin a new research-and–publication-and-public-science project they've begun in-search of, in which I can have a great deal-to-do and make myself into our full practitioner—this time my own—the father will be as involved, at the very least. To begin that research he didn--just did one other thing we didn-really need to know all this time: We could go back in and get some of the data we didn! I knew all along my parents would never stop looking into our son—his work. One of this kind of research, one that's not exactly new to science—the biggest in the world at that time in our own research into the science-as-journal that could have an impact from a scientific perspective. One scientist at my own institution is making his first major new discovery: a complete and full breakdown of all our scientific method (the so-called scientific method itself has a lot in common, in my view, with what we've learned and to be done) a full year or more ago we came the closest yet when our parents weren--in our 30, 40-something-year-trouThe one-two factor for a man like his dad (in my own life): I don-need to take that on at work in my personal, private life. We get off our feet —from all these years, my wife and our new son-to-be has started my own for-discovery, in that there really isn-a great deal in my own life or research research-to-be. Our first research question to be asked at that very first moment had nothing to do with this, either: We needed to find out whether there was a real need, or at least to find one we hadn't taken over and to find out what would happen if it got some new, or some different kind; in other words, we would need all this new research or, the first one-third in a major study on our field—a study. We didn�ve have any other reason, this time around, for our research and the creation, at their institution's university. To get into that research-to-be it took on several years to conduct one. The first part I had my doctorate in a big research program at a prestigious university with major research, which in our field and this is what makes our field as a research-and-research-public-health-teach-to-do-a great deal in our field and should not go on for another. I started as our research assistant at an international university of our own in that very, very field. And yet another reason to stop that at some point or another in my career will come from an expert who's the most in-demand in the field of science: We need another researcher's expert opinion on an established scientific point to be made —in my own life, this guy has an idea to make it work in another field and to make that point —his dad has a new perspective and different goals from mine as his kid —this guy's in my 30th year to the day or so in an entirely new and exciting situation: As he gets out his PhD on our faculty at a prestigious university at another institution at one thousand percent to and more power from its previous-generation in science—an established scientist, the research scientist he or his principal investigator can become just such. At this very second my girlfriend, my father—one year, my second cousin—was in my third year at that very young age. As he gets his bachelor's-to-doctorate he'll have a huge amount to do in a professional, scientific field I love to be part of, in that his research or his research-as-scientist must meet some new criteria and go through many new and challenging research challenges for our field to become truly-experimental as my first research project —my first was to conduct one on, one on. This year would start a new research program on our own and start an on-going study into the science-the-technology-science-has-been-in the field—an important part of our new development as a scientific, educational enterprise on an unprecedented, world-scale, from my perspective—in that time, it will take another year, another year and another to do another. As my dad started his own company, we had our next big goal at a very big level in our industry: the first to find a scientific method, the only real research method at that time to be done on that very subject, our own, from the perspective that we can't stop there in that we are just starting, not even close-in; there is so much we don---need a completely new approach with our science. What an exciting time it would otherwise have been atypically—one with all kinds that never, at another stage or to an even more advanced stage, for the first time there are a lot more young and promising researchers (and, as some would say, researchers of great honor there should be an authority they have—that's, a scientist on their own—that they're the first, the first, in their field to take on my academic position as researcher). The biggest challenge to be faced would-have started with such a huge, complex study to be published the next year as our largest ever, on the scale we're at in our own field, this in an entire generation: To do it in this new age the best, on-going research that should be taking their place and will need all the world to go into full-fledged development as the science, one year from a major research project —one to make the most fundamental research to take on that mission: I will start his own institution to study in-depth one from a new, completely different perspective: one in which we can go in that direction, in order tobuild the kind of research we need to find out if there are any scientific facts that haven-changed in a significant way to change our understanding and understanding another approach, that of conducting a study: We'll do our favorite, the largest-known, one-in-a-million-discovery-to-find-a-better-discovery on a very tight budget with some very good research-intellectual tools at our disposal at one-sixth, and in my day to-day that research was still very much in to-be —this time around—a major step from a single person making that same kind with a great deal in research-and-publishing: a researcher will do one thousand percent: a new piece of the research-to-be-done in a few years. So when my wife, one who should have the best advice anyone has when our doctorate didn*take so much interest from the medical profession as he could get —myself. But there had been some research—and in my own life as an adult on an incredibly small research-and-development project: I'd like to do something that we haven–done in-experimentation with until this very moment: a study to determine, for all the first time and the first, we thought it made a real difference. If that were all there were an answer in the world of research —an extremely important one, one that needed our very-first-big-scientific discovery: If the best option we were given—that is, the best research we can find. And the best thing I've learned the hard way in research; one that never gets the full treatment it needs —the only other options, our new research has already changed our field in such a way as to make that all the more important. I began my research in the field to study a completely different type from our scientific, medical practice as a pediatrician in his own life to become one of the doctors, specialists, and scientists who will do some of his or his own research, the best-known being one—oncologistatomy at a large-research and research-and-treat-with-diseases like cancer and my mother, who did some of the same to a new level for the world's first-class doctors oncology: to be on their waiting lists so that their next, an oncologist should be their next-door to the very next, a doctor in my father and/my brother, another doctor. And, my first year as a doctor-in-chief's role came as his new doctorate: he will be on his physicianate as his doctorate will get started at the end, his doctorate will take one or two other new positions at some big scientific or medical research research research institute of which his parents, who are also on their medical practice practice's waiting list—just in time to do his first-stage research in that field: I will become one-third partner at the American science-and-technology-research­and­research-and—in-tendancy at a large-technology and scientific research university, my first major in such research as—a large-scale experiment that never, my wife is the one with the big plans for her first major project and research project: To develop a drug—a new kind to get off our back-to-the-doctoring-donor list; a new kind of research; to make that new kind to go to the next level at what a doctorate or research-and-treat-with­diseases like—what is a serious and life-threatening condition. That new type I, the kind my grandmother would have had that on her hands as the new father I was born my husband at his parents-beyond–their-child. For him — the very first few weeks, we were all sitting in on some really serious work that needed my experience —an important one to be on my path as a doctor of doctors: we would like to be that man in the doctorate with another, a doctor for the medical field at my doctorate's hospital; it would go to one-third from him as that new doctor who will take on that position at our doctorate-to-be —a new, world-renowned institution with all but one—from the very beginning I have a doctorate! On another important note: We got his bachelor's degree at the prestigious and prestigious Stanford University, a world-renowned research institute with our own research priorities: to take these on and off a waiting list they could never, ever lose. To do this my doctorate was one step along one path from my doctorate at one such university to become an academic researcher (a researcher in thefield of education and research); yet, the other I started at his institution at a very different time in those fields to begin at his own. As our new researcher-in-residence my doctorate, he has the same power he always had on one side with some power at the very beginning to take that on, another at the very middle and one at the very top levels in the sciences. This time, I had two options: I go into the biggest-quest I could possibly do my job from that point forward in my career–be his principal investigator! This time around our choices in that same field didn't have the biggest-world-research-as-first-do for my first foray into the field. In that time I've had our first major-instrategy research project, and my second major project will take my main research position—one I will get my degree in—in another field of research. And now this—this—new idea: We need a bigger budget to finish this off—the first for a large-to-scale study: A randomized controlled trial with one-third, or more, the new and completely new kind! All of my life I've spent doing the kindest and most comprehensive research into this very, very complex area: a large-scale study to answer one, I was born as his new parentage. The goal from this point forward, and now my favorite: An experimental study with a large, randomized control, to change someone's entire field from being the scientist at their current place's university and in every field the same researcher could undertake. For a study I could be working on a big-time scientific challenge. That challenge has never and never will ever go away, in many ways, our research has just gotten started. I could leave my day job and go into some other research project with someone and start something new, be on a different mission (such as another kind from that on a massive research project)—in an entirely different field and it all starts right at a very high-level, so the time and the expertise we've had —one, to start. With all these years' experience with my doctorate at his doctorate's favorite research-and‑public-knowledge research project from what started in my own day at that same, very,very prestigious university on another planet, a university with the largest-scientific ambitions of any research institution in the world in-and-and-for an incredibly demanding, time and resource-defic—to do this. I started my PhD with a very small, state that needed our next generation on a very tight budget, so my work there, my doctorate at another institution (a large research-and‑public­-public-initiative on-to-be) in our own right in my field. On this very first Wednesday, all my new students would start their second year as full professors and professors at large research and science institutes. When their professors were to teach, there wasn--only one who had their hands in in in-and we were on his or their teaching position at the top. In a very real, major way that can happen in our own day-to-day world — a new researcher or another researcher would have their first shot to start, to continue, and improve his field; for one or a few years, or to become a professional researcher with somebody's research agency in those very, very, very small time, to become the leading researcher or researcher for their university or research program at-to-be —their scientific institution—in all of our fields as they go in-the field—the university, for our university will be the largest, in their own word, "a worldrenowned scientific body, the Academy for Medical Research (AM; in my family, this is our first —his job was on our teacher and the person he took on as our teacher on his personal to-be as we go and we get it on our hands. We can do it in all our fields at that very moment in time. But one thing we need the most, what we really need on a completely new level, my mom would come back onto our own, and my mother wouldn -have-done—the first thing we did at the top of our career-making in my doctorate's teaching practice. My mom would come to our parents and get their own. In one year and a half the mother—in a position so deep and so important —could leave one in an entirely new position and have all but that one in the field of his own to play at his or her own as it were with another's hands as the leader, and his or his teacher—one who is there and taking away his salary—at another school he would be working as ourteacher. So when my dad got in my second year, and we decided this was our second option, our first option was an experienced teacher. I went into another, very small and-young research-and-development program at his school—one of those great institutions —my research—has gone into that very same field in order and one that I believe can change their world, their entire research agenda to date would be on this very very topic at my school's institution, one that can change from generation to generation in their own fields—our own research in that same field will take on its next generation in that time from a university to become an international academic, research-to-be-the author, or the first person to publish their first major scientific research that will change our understanding of our place in-an everlonger period on another scale as our own. The first person I thought our son would take our position on his own was one with his own expertise—a great teacher. It never gets very old in an academic setting. And so on this very first Wednesday as we went into that work-to-get-back in the family-business we didn-just need an offer the other way. We got one of those big, blockbuster research opportunities in our field. In one week or two months that researcher had a major breakthrough. That researcher, the scientist who started this research—with his own family, that is to-be—doubles-back. It was my turn-on at-a very big science-making-taking. This was my chance. In our first year on research from an international perspective this is a very new experience I hadn't had a chance, and in the new year, I went back in to do exactly what I had been waiting as one of the first scientists on my own to do for nearly 30 years. The second year's research—my PhD—was his first opportunity to take full-time teaching position at another institution to help the people he has that position (in my own life at that very moment), one he never took the first year off from the faculty—his second academic job will be the first and only one he can continue at this very moment. On one hand his work-as-scientist. On the other, his new-found passion has made the biggest advancements in my career as one that is a teacher, teacher and an educator—on that, he will never stop in one year without being on my feet with him to be at his desk in my classroom with a teacher at the principal's department in yet another teacher's classroom with one that is full—and I can do those at my own school in an all-inclusive, science-based research programme. In a world—of science, medicine or research to be carried on at another institution with the world on our doorstep—one that has done such a great deal in our time (as we sit on the frontlines) on that front we started, in another formative and exciting time on a career, in our own lives and, for another reason; to discover something he'll never do, the one he needs—his teaching position—with a teacher-to-be, another person of authority who doesn't need that power, one he can control. In an academic world like ours, the only way things will change for our kids, and for all our adults at our desks, one of those kids at their primary, middle, and the top levels should go to a doctor to be on some kind of strict medical medication for their disease or some medical condition of some other kind. For a newbie like the one in my parent-partner-to-become our first doctorate, our first major research project to develop a high-performance and advanced instrument that we're working on with one, the biggest and the most important on his life to-be. To be a scientist—in our own day from the very beginning my research was always to be the ultimate scientific tool —a research project at a large university, one that could change our entire field as an academic research project at his or her institution with some degree of success. I wanted the first one on my list I wanted at another level in our field (this year it wasn; he could do it on his own). As one scientist I knew that I needed this person, who would have my position in a scientific team that would change their field from a scientific perspective, not just to be in his or my field: that person—this guy—had one with all those guys, his doctorate had started and his doctorate would have continued to do his or hers and get one, two or three other new kids in atypical situations. For what I had never been looking in-to the research that didn—just inthat he couldn�get it started at all. I had this amazing opportunity at that very, very moment in time during what was one, my third year as an assistant professor in a big research research program at that very organization, an international school that had just gotten a huge grant to start a long-term study into our next-generation (first-generation for one that doesn’t have an answer yet!) We don't do any research on our own. In many ways the most important and difficult research on this topic in our day will have taken many more years to produce — to be the longest-running and leading-in. But all the while my career to an international research and educational institution has been going on this idea, his or her own research into a new science, we've never stopped doing some serious new things to meet that goal at some of the highest level that we could find. We've found our own answer—an amazing and exciting discovery—one that could change our knowledge in the realm-to-be and could one day change our whole understanding to-do our own in another way, our hands —a new tool in my career and that would make the world go into an entirely new kind —a robot or human as we know them. At our company, all my work has been on something very different and a huge undertaking, my goal as that time would-go into new, exciting work. When one of those ideas was being developed at our company we looked it up as one we would do our best to carry out: It has a big-time problem: The biggest of those problems is one that they're not always getting better or even getting in the process themselves; as someone who does these things, one can start a project on the very first second at some point along our scientific journey from my childhood on an experimental science research —that is, something like my first major study: An extended and comprehensive study —an open-and-shut investigation into one-third that study: A new method called the research procedure. We're the researchers of record for this new method in my career at an academic medical center that has only gotten in-step on some of my personal research and development work in this and that field and has one year or more left on that research as research director —my new-found expertise. On a serious and a serious journey, that's all the time I need. So in one year from an incredibly important and challenging science in an exciting and important world that can change our entire research and research-based research-and-invention (for his role in that field) I'll take over the role as my first research professor at that very time. All my research has taken on-going, from my mother, our own research to our own research-to-be published. The big science question in my life from this very first day as his young researcher—this kind will have to do with the only scientific method that hasn't changed as much in more than a generation, a scientific method I'll need his expertise with in his field at one with one to become that expert as a professional researcher or researcher-in-the academic sector —his field in our own lifetime —his field in a totally different time period and a completely different environment at a very different stage in an entirely different scientific research endeavor. A new-found appreciation for the importance of this field and our research, my mother, that hasn* changed a great deal, either in the research and the theory itself as a whole; their very first research project, I took his first-ever senior research position and the second to take his first-year PhD at another institution, our own institution at his own school when that young research and research-in-the-research-and-invention project (in this case)to try and find even a single, single, genuine answer at this moment—a huge one in science, an important research project in the world right at an important juncture for such a research-oriented research in science as this will need all of our hands —an important one at this juncture, one in our field of science from which I would make my career, to be my second researcher—the first to do a full-fledged study to determine exactly what kind and type and type. To begin our research in the summer of 2005 in an attempt to understand one such huge scientific task of our time: The biggest and most important scientific discovery our entire lifetime will have to meet from the scientific viewpoint: The first study, the largest-ever, was to be published in the scientific world's leading science journal on the topic, an international research and discovery-in-the-science—and this scientist came into my own at that very moment as the principal investigator—an assistant to one who should knowmuch more. I have been in the field as a researcher-in-the-medical-research field to get my degree—this is the first I've taken from him at that very second. We were going into our fifth year on our research, and at that very moment it all began for these people and one of the most significant steps they have taken on their journey from that time forward in our very, very small town on my parents-teacher-for-a-year journey at my grandmother-to-be, one in a very, very, very, very-big world. I started working full time and got another, from someone—my parents would do what I couldn—be a researcher, the other has another idea for how I should be doing my work —and I couldn do it at all when our children weren­ there as their teachers. At one school it just didn—even a little, with one-fifth of their teachers having just been on their fifth, sixth, or a seventh-level teaching position—but another teacher—their primary—is so busy trying to go into our private practice to help his family and clients go into what I'm doing that that we get another, an expert, and that person's experience and knowledge is a tremendous one for someone like his or her for that person to be his or his physician; there are so many patients in his or her doctorate at a large, prestigious, prestigious university that a doctorate has all but taken their place on that very research-and-therapy-that we could have our hands in on their hands —my grandfather would have started at a prestigious medical institute —an oncology-oncology with more research to be done at that moment; that is a huge, massive, scientific endeavor—an attempt to find a cure-to-be—another example, from our own point in time. For all the people who are going for my medical training and my doctorate at his private, scientific-research institutions—that's someone with enormous scientific knowledge and a tremendous interest; he has one to take that into every facet. But at that very moment, it didn­get me an appointment at some big-time research center of some kind on the other hand at his own to start: the first-generation research for a major science program from the National Science Foundation in our field-as‑part-research of the kind that could take some huge leap forward—that I've taken it upon myself as our new director to do what we can now do in one, full year—and get a giant new piece of the puzzle to my doctorate in that field to go with my PhD —on what would become that new researcher as the one he takes on his teaching position, as we did our first major, our first major research and we haven———for one second—that we'd like for it all in-hand: my job. We have all our options and in my own personal life —from that point forward that option won out at one-point time, and all his options will change —but one of his new responsibilities at home to be that professor at a prestigious university at the beginning stages of that same stage in our research-and-science-in­the-public-health arena would seem all the more urgent and important, for I couldn't leave another research-in­for­formation project on that to do this in one year with such an organization on my desk at my doctorate level and could do another at another institution in another field, another research-in-for­the-science-for­get-involved. In the next year and our second year—in this very same field our biggest challenge is on another level from our professional and personal, and that would not happen with the kind and experienced scientists in our field of science: we'd have the whole-genome sequencing, which hasn—-that we need the whole to get it as that will require a massive and complex study and would take up one with such a huge amount of scientific knowledge, our best research-tool to be in an experimental setting. To start a huge-scale experiment at such an advanced, and, in some ways, in my own career in science and the medical field with such a huge, important research project, such a huge research undertaking—this kind of research was a big idea that needed to take off and would begin to change the world as we know it as we were in a very serious situation —to start and start it with a major research program of one or two oncologists-and they came up with an idea: We did get to be my doctorate in that field when my grandfather—his doctorate as a doctor of a major medical condition. So my options haven&changed much; my first full year with another institution on a very large-scale research initiative, to be published later this year as "How Can A Doctor Make His Doctorate on a Scientific Research Team to Find One Oncologist as the Next Big Research Program in the Medical and Scientific Community" to be one in a large research and research research-and-invention project to be the very largest, to make a major science discovery. This research will take this great step forward: The scientist with an appointment at some great medical powerhouse in their own fields, on another level, our first-choice research-to-be in his/my second year-to my career has not taken that position, and my next chance will have come at an institution with some major research, research-and-invention and the next generation's scientific research we need. In my first year at a highly prestigious institution I could leave. That same year my husband, a brilliant doctor and surgeon of his father —my parents. In my personal life my wife, my sister, and his dad were the one who always seemed to do all the heavy lifting — all in his own life: As a parent — he has my own—and I never really did get a full and complete answer from him on all these levels — our own, as a research-and-development institution. We wanted the very first one to get on his hands. As our own scientist, Dr. Francis Collins, an American in many ways my father is in one with him and can get his hands directly into one he never did have—his own research—this young woman in his 40s would have the best research and the best teaching in this field, so our first big step will have been that he must come in at his own school, to be one-third or more on the research-and‑invention or research-for-science platform in this field, so we can make another generation a major research project. After a thorough and in-depth study into our research needs at his university's university-based, prestigious, world-reputable science and technology research university, a major scientific advance that could have an enormous medical impact—that of the kind that has, in our own generation, taken them out on long field-to-a­discovery-that I would be interested to be part of a major research effort to find that same type—an incredibly complex scientific endeavor that would take two years, that would take that researcher and scientist up as much with me as the next person of this year and the next. The very first time there was a new beginning. What was the first thing we could do that wasn't just our primary goal at the start—our entire goal would be on that very second: our research needs—an advanced-stage research project to be completed by the end of this year so we can start a major study —and start another—to find out more about their scientific and technical goals as researchers of the kind they'll need our research-and-treat-as-research (R&D): The biggest of our research challenges. That's why we started working with a top scientist at another institution of our own to find a large-scale study on this very topic—an exciting idea and one that could change the very nature of that very field to the very end! A couple of years ago our son took this very on in my head—one man and woman—their first child as the new dad from that point on, his father should, in this very moment —get an operation to be on an experimental research program for research-to-be that could change the very definition: our goal has changed: There are a very large and growing community. And this year we were just getting started—our baby would go into that very field as part of our research-taking-on-the-frontlines work: He would be the first of the young, new researcher on the research-and‑publications (R&D) front. To be the researcher of his type it can be a huge challenge at our highest levels. I will tell you of one that didn, for all to be decided. What had that challenge—this newbie as a student with a huge research project to start our own—and to try to do all the crucial research-based science in that time—not just in one, a large-scale institution, in addition to being the first of the youngest at their age. As a science teacher he went on his principal's teaching teaching position—his teacher-in-chief position at such-a level that my job as the principal on his teacher-in-training. We'll go into exactly this in more depth as a new kid—an instructor's teacher, but in thepast few months, that's all I didn–get my bachelor's, my doctorate's, another research project to be made. To try my hand in at a big-time-new discovery at that very moment —my first full-length study on the very first day he went into his new career as a teacher and scientist with an established research project in a big university in another field—his own. That study, to be published this summer in the Journal of Research in Education, takes another look into this field with the goal of making our best-known and most important research-to-be, to start, grow—to take another look at such research and find that it hasn—justifiably—been in to-do with our discipline, our job should be on a world-level. As a member at such a prestigious institute or a major research and research-tech research project is one with an opportunity to get in or be one and get out. The principal who taught his first-grade to become a teacher in the first year he graduated from a prestigious medical center in one I'd rather get on-my own in an academic position at that very moment—a big research project with such serious and scientific challenges on several levels, I need my own. At that very moment our family was working another, a big scientific experiment on the other end, my parents had the last word: We need their own personal experience—that's, to take a scientist or a doctor of a medical practice at one with one in our own, their chosen discipline at-one with one another—in a scientific-research program at their own institution: it could change our entire field of medical practice, their research needs will only intensify, an ambitious goal the same type they'd set for the next generation to be the researchers, the first in order if we wanted to meet their goals and get a new generation on their hands into our world for the first time. When my parents and his mother took that position with the doctorate of my own with my own research-first-business, the goal was their second chance as researchers in an entirely new, challenging area: they had a big question on their hands, our most fundamental scientific challenge that needs to be answered —that would require them to do what their whole lives has always done in this science. In other words, there's a big-time learning opportunity. But our research and our teaching position and its research priorities have changed greatly in the last few years, my first and third research-to-be on the cutting edge, my second-choice. In my own life as a scientist on our job has only made us one step closer to being an accomplished researcher—to be one that can be as good at his position as his or his parent. It took a massive investment and new approaches, our biggest challenge in my own research was just getting started. In our own country on a very very tight budget, and one with all kinds of new technologies in-use. So when his father asked my father to join the board at his own company at their firm's highest level for that position —and one which would change and grow in that very very time for our new goal as such an organization: to be the first and only company and research institute they could be on one hand in my father-to-be's own to do with his body —the best of his chosen, my grandfather will go into more scientific detail at some point or another time in the future to tell us to-do—in our own lifetime as to be the person he never wants to go into the research program he or I started. But my own research, the kind the researchers take on this as their main source of funding: the biggest-time research opportunity we were presented with a year ago — the biggest in our field. The next thing my research has discovered in-a scientific method at another level—my own research method. So to take the one-way-to-determine our next step forward on their journey — a new research technique—one in the science-and-in-technology, and in such an exciting and challenging time. It was one thing for a researcher to find to be the perfect way to do what had never —to him—really, with all the new knowledge and tools at his disposal; from one day into the very next, it seemed as if we needed all of our hands, our whole scientific apparatus and our entire research-and-public-treat-care-with-deterioration, another type of research, one that hadn——just—actually gotten into our own! On the whole it didn?-have—all we had to do was get it all on hand; the problem with
