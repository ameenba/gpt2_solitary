I had a second chance at a family I'd been through the same things. The moment I saw my parents for the first time in several months (which was the beginning of an almost yearlong split with them), I felt like that was the first step toward coming back as a dad; that was the first time in a decade the kids in your life would come around and want for that. Then there was this; the other thing I never learned growing up: The first thing that I learned every second of our time together: You can't live with them forever. I can't live without them. When things got difficult I'd take the advice my dad would give, the one that would help me get through all these years, right here, right now. "Don't give up, I will take care of myself. My dad never gave him a reason, but my mom never once did either — that, to me, was a perfect deal for her that made him the greatest dad of all. I would be back in her shoes; but at least my dad had my back: The only thing I never learned, from that point on, was that my dad is not that great a father. And my mom is my best friend and this guy can be my best friend. And I can be his. The point of all this is: If there was a world-class coach in our generation it wouldn't have worked out as well for this kid as it did for me. My dad became a great coach, and the most important thing to him was to get me into his game, and as a child I wasn’t playing a lot of football — there wasn’t a lot of it; I couldn’t move around to become a full-time professional footballer at a high level. I knew what the next step would be: I would go to a college to become a coach. This is my first real step into that: I would be taking a year off from football. And it wasn’t that long after that, either. I had just finished my final year at Yale University, an amazing experience at a place I thought we would be friends forever, right down to a street. This was my second year at the University, my second year, my first year in South Africa as a full-time player, my first year in Australia as someone. And yet, here we were. I didn’t get along with any of my teammates at all. It was not that I didn’t want to be on our teams, either. I was on the team from the beginning, and I felt like I had a special connection and everything that went along with being on it, both on and off—a bond that was stronger than any other. I felt at home and at home in every single game. I felt like this was my home away from home, my family—a place where I felt at home at home, even though I didn’t feel particularly comfortable at home at home. I grew up in a house with a small backyard, my backyard, so the grass was the grass was the grass. Our yard was always my backyard, and my backyard was the backyard, my backyard my backyard. In those days my backyard didn’t exist. In those days we lived right on the edge of a village which had a small road running through it, so if someone called my home from a village in a small village there would have been no problem if I had anything but a fence. I’d be up all night, running around the yard, playing and eating and then waking up the next morning for another round of yardwork and more. I wasn’t allowed anywhere near the town or the city—nor the houses in any case—and I couldn’t even walk from my house in my driveway into the backyard or down to the back yard to see what the neighbors were up to—that wasn’t allowed. We always lived in an almost-apartheid zone, with a white majority, a few black people, a few black farmers, a few white farmers. My favorite part of the white middle class, as a native-born white boy, was the suburbs of New York—the suburbs of the city. They were the most beautiful place on earth. My mom would take me to see the sights, and she would take me to live a very comfortable life of suburbia as a suburbanite, in an incredibly expensive apartment on a very nice beach, with a swimming pool, a beach with no running water and tennis courts, a tennis court, and a roof and roof and a roof, and all, in between. There wouldn’t be a problem with that. I was at home all day from one weekend to the next: a three-dayvacation in the summer followed by an eight-day vacation in the fall for family; I couldn’t be on a three-day vacation for eight consecutive days, so my wife and my two kids came along and got my back up for a month. When that was over in two weeks, there wasn’t an excuse for staying home and being on my own for another month or two. My son came home from a year in Brazil at the beginning of this year, and as his senior year was upon us the pressure on us to make sure he did was starting to build up again. By the end of the year I was back living in the city. This time I was a part of the problem. I knew that as the kids grew older, and more and more of us moved into our own homes, I would become the main source of that housing. I wasn’t prepared for that. In my first year he was five, in my second year he was six, and in the third year he was seven—but here I was, in my backyard in an area he knew nothing about, living in a world he was not from, in a time he never saw a doctor, had his parents get divorced, and couldn’t go back to work. All of that for the most part, it worked out to be a blessing and a curse for my life. But for a short while things were not going in our favor all that well either—it had become common knowledge in their homeland that my father would cheat and have an affair in their home as a kid—and that would bring down the family. My mom would get the divorce and then get another one, and there was no going back. My dad’s affair, which was his first sexual encounter in a long time—I think it was before age thirteen—was his biggest mistake, and the reason he was so infatuated and distant with me. There was always the thought: My father is such an asshole, he won’t change—that I would never grow up. This was my first experience of a man who would cheat and be infatuated—that he would cheat and not be honest with me about it—that he would lie and cheat all the time about everything from a child to his first marriage in a year to his third marriage in 20 years to the day that there was an affair with his stepmom as well. This is what I know to be true: I wasn’t the kind of kid to do anything. They would tell us all our friends were like—I couldn’t see past one person; another person couldn’t see past it for that; then I couldn’t leave. My mom would tell us not to be like that. But my dad wouldn’t do anything in the way of a change. At the end of every year my dad would give us all some sort of gift. I got this. It came in the mail a couple of months after graduation from high school. It was a toy from a toy company that was all mine—one pair of sneakers, one pair of socks. It was such a great gift that we didn’t see it coming that this year my mom took my brother, who was in the military at the time, away to go live in the city at a company called Toys R Us. My parents, who were great friends of mine at my military academy—the West Point—didn’t get that chance. I didn’t want them in that city. We were in a suburb on our own. But the city had just been gentrified and my brother-in-law wanted the suburb—I knew that would happen, so this time I could be the beneficiary—and I knew what that meant for me. At the mall there was a big display of my favorite Disney animated movies of all time—Star Wars, Star Trek—and my favorite video game of all time, the classic Atari game, "Metroid. If only it had been an interactive game: A Metroid! Maybe I could do this all day, but I could have my mom! That would be a dream come true! At least the movie was a fun experience! My dad gave it to me as an investment, not only in himself, but also in me: This isn’t my real life. This isn’t like my life is a simulation at a strip mall. This isn’t my life is a series of movies: This isn’t a bunch of video games, or a bunch of videos. This isn’t a bunch of cartoons: These aren’t my favorite movies ever or my favorite cartoon series ever. This is my first taste of a real-video game. It wouldn’t have been a problem, except for the fact that the game I was getting was a Nintendo Entertainment System; I had never, at any point in my life, owned a console system in its native form, the Nintendo Entertainment System. I couldn’t get the console for a price that I wanted; my parents would have probably been more than happy to take me in for a day at their house, giving us a taste of life as Nintendo had done for many of us—the kind of thing they do all the time. But that didn’t happen. At least, that is, when Nintendo was all the rage. Here I am, twenty years into my first marriage, being the parent of two kids, and I don’t have that problem with our son growing up on his mother's sofa. At least, my wife doesn’t have that problem with ours. In my first year of marriage, our relationship came out of the woodwork: Her relationship with her husband got so bad that I could feel that my marriage would be over and we were on our way to divorce. Then she got pregnant again: And then…then it all came full circle. Then it all came full circle, right into my mom, the mother and I. Then the baby went through the birth control and my mother got pregnant right at the same time—for a lot more reasons than one. It was so simple: I was a man of my own. In my first year of marriage, our marriage broke into several pieces. I never thought we’ll be back so well, ever. This time I knew my only option was to try and be like my father—that is, the guy, who wasn’t into me on any level. This time I was the guy, and it worked. I had all of my own, and the girls' insecurities on a scale of one to ten—and it was a perfect balance: I got to be everything they weren’t: a father, the husband—that guy. But in my first year in our relationship, I got the cold shoulder from my father when he didn’t come around and be like everybody else who wanted him back in their lives. I got to deal personally with his alcoholism, his drug abuse, his mental instability—none of those things were to be changed for the better in any way whatsoever. The only thing I learned is that if my father and his family aren’t able (or unwilling) to accept me back as their own, then they don’t deserve my relationship. They won’t be the man for my wife and I. That would be a tragedy for their children as well. In a year or two, maybe we could take a step together, but it only took me a decade. My relationship with my mom had become one big family reunion and a chance to go back to the days when I was the sole parent. My mom took my stepfather to see a movie—another family, one with their own set of problems and their own struggles, just for a little fun. Then she took her brother-in-law to a concert—another family, another time, where there won’t be any problems except for a little more family. And that was not the best of those times. All that time spent with my dad and his family was really only for an introduction, an opportunity to meet the people from my childhood, another chance to be a part of their lives. But that was only half of the reason I fell for my mom. The other reason is that I learned from my mom the power and value of her: How important it is to treat that relationship the same way that my relationships have been treated from my earliest years: as a means—a way out, a place of love. My dad was, and probably still, the greatest dad I ever had, a great dad. He never gave me anything but the love and support that I knew could help me through this. As a teen-ager, my dad was a huge influence on all of my personal and professional life. My dad, who grew up in the United States, came to America from England; my mom was born and brought up in London because my mother wanted him to be in her life. My dad was not only one of the best teachers and teachers of me, he also became my mentor. He taught me how to be a great student and a great student of me. And I had no idea I was a great student until that classroom year. A few years before that he’sthe reason I got to go to U.C.L.A. —the school I’knew I couldn’tdo at home. So he gave me a chance. And I took that risk. I learned a lot from taking that classroom year to become one of the best football players on the planet: a world-class athlete from a great country, a man who gave back in such a short period of time. When he left on a football scholarship for another school, in another place, my parents were the best parents in their country. And I was in an amazing situation: on the one hand, I had the privilege of growing up with a great family; on the other hand, I was the son of someone who had to live in a world of violence, discrimination, and oppression for years. But what an incredible gift that was — to be an example of something really important in our generation at a time when all was right and it was going really well, at such a young age and in such a loving relationship, how could I pass up? But for one thing it wasn’t quite that simple. My parents had two sons — it never occurred to us that we were in any way related — and there wasn’t a single person in our families who had anything in common besides a shared love of sports as our favorite pastime. So our bond with football was a tight one, as one son would run away from home as a child and the other one would follow. In those days it wasn’t really any big deal that I was his brother. In those days there were no problems with that, no drama. All I knew was that my dad and my brother were like brothers in every possible way: both of them would be the men in their father's life, and one would be the father of their children. In those days there wasn’t much to change in my life. And my mom had already decided that this was not my life. So, in a way that was a blessing in disguise for me: I learned that my own dad could be the father of another child with my mom; he could be the father of a kid—and his son would have me back on my mother's side. My mom would come across as the mother of all heroes. I learned from a very young age to never feel alone. Her kindness is the best gift she was ever given; the closest thing to what I learned as a teenager when she gave me some of the very best advice: Don’t let it go: The world is only going to be your friends if you can be your best friend. That was one thing that set me apart from them all — I could have been a kid who followed their advice and became like that, but what I learned as an adult is that that for whatever reason I wasn’t like them. I couldn’t stay on their good side because, even as a kid, I found myself becoming that friend on my own. In some ways my mom is like my father for two reasons: He was my dad — my dad and his dad were like family. They had a sense of responsibility, too, and as a result, I couldn’t let that go to my head. I had to stay with them as a couple of years, because as a child I knew there couldn’t have been — never could — be a more perfect example of what a father looks like than my dad. He just couldn’t get out of his house at night; my mother could never leave. My dad was always the guy with everything: the kids in the yard, work to do at our house, our kids at school. If anyone in the family wanted to become a father I had their back. My mom worked so hard and so patiently as a stay-at-home mom to raise us — her life never failed to be a constant pursuit in the pursuit of her own happiness — that I never doubted that if she stayed with her husband, there couldn’t be a more perfect example of the kind of man she would become: a man who could be her best example for an all-around good father. One of the things that I saw in the world right away at home was that this man, for the most part in contrast to the others — for most people this was a man of peace in one part of the world. He didn’t drink; his wife never gave him any—we never went on the town for a weekend to party or go on some weekend escape in a beachfront resort; he didn’t live in a big house; if anything, it looked like his home was a very small shack surrounded by jungle in another part of the world, in a whole new time and place. But as a child, all he knew was one thing:We had a lot in common. It wasn’t until I was a teenager—one year later—that I decided to learn something new that I understood why we would be friends in the middle. And here we were as best friends, having a blast—that and our shared love of music—and all of a sudden the music just stopped and it didn’t seem like I was part of any club anymore —not to mention everything else that was going on. There weren’t any clubs in that area any longer, or in any other part of town. When it came time to hang out, it never looked like we’d be hanging out at bars anymore. My Mom’s parents would have us spend an afternoon hanging out on our front porch, but I wasn’t that into going out. My friends went out on their date nights, went out for a few drinks—that’s all that. I didn’t feel that I cared. My Mom didn’t want me to know what they were up to. I didn’t know what my mom would do if she saw me. My dad would have no problem if he didn’t know what a date was—if we weren’t dating at all. That was the thing I knew. If something happened, I wasn’t the only one with a problem; my mom would be the one in a lot of those situations. At any rate, that was the first time anything serious ever went wrong with us, and at least for the time being it was all good. Then the second, not-so-first, third. By the time everything was sorted out, I was a year older. At the beginning of the third grade I started getting in trouble because of my mom. I did a year of community service. When that was all over, I got a good job at a company, which is why I got that good-paying internship. That was the first real step in the process of getting my hands dirty at work at a company of my choice; my first full-time job was as a copywriter on site for them. But that was all, all that time at a company I wasn’t learning the ropes, at a company that would give me a chance at a new career; in fact, it was my first real step up toward that; that, to my knowledge, was the biggest moment of my life: I started as an artist at a company I didn’t know—and didn’t want to be at. After that I wasn’t going anywhere, at least not for a long time. At least I didn’t have that. I wasn’t doing any real art at that point—anything but cartoons. In my late teens my mom went on an interesting trip to an exotic country for a very, very short time—nothing more —but after a year or two I had to move back home with her for a while and get my hands on a real-life job. It’s a big step, really, and I felt like from the moment my mom gave me my first paycheck I was set on life in one-person-one-person-one-person-one-person-one-person-one-person-one-person-two-person-two-person-two-person-two-person-one-person-two-person-two-person-two-person-one-person-two-person. And then that wasn’t happening anymore? Then why in God, was this thing all my own to start with? I didn’t get the chance to take a new career path. In that time at work at this company I had a very supportive family and friends, so I wasn’t as burdened by the demands of that outside-the-company-work as a lot of the other people in this place. But at least I knew that I was an independent person. I felt like I didn’t need them anymore. At that point in my life I didn’t really need any other people in my life just to be there all around. But as a teenager I‸t did have another thing in common with the people in this town that would have given me a huge advantage: I could go from one friend to another in less than a day—from person to person in less than an hour. My life in this town was an amazing opportunity for that because, from day to day in my new town, I was the biggest fan of the local sports team. And in the summer I was the biggest cheerleader of the local high school basketball team, and I became one of its greatest players. But for all mytalent and passion as an athlete, I was not the best-known guy on the team—or, perhaps more accurately, the best-known guy on the team was my parents, who—along with their family—are my main source of support when it came to my growing up. What my mom always wanted to know is, Where do I get my talent? What skills do I need for that? In America, there are no jobs that pay more than, let's say, minimum, a few hundred. That's how much it costs me to be on the team, not counting the time my mom spends at work or at university. That's where my focus has always been all along. There's not a job at McDonald's, a Burger King, Pizza Hut that pays more than an average minimum wage. For my birthday my sister came out from the hospital. It was a week later—she was eight years old—and the next thing I knew, she was a teenager again. She worked all day at McDonald's. Then another week she was in school for, you guessed it, school. I was one of those kids like, I couldn’t stay home from school to be with my parents. But in America my dad got that call, which—to my surprise—actually turned out to be my chance to stay at home until the birth of my grandchild, who was born, in my hometown. In fact the whole thing—in a week—was like my mother telling me all about some amazing thing, but in another week I was at the beach again, at my favorite restaurant in America—a place called La Boulangerie, which had all kinds of great things to do—it just wasn’t where things were. I got a taste of what it was like to be on the road for a few weeks on my first trip. I went to France to see some of my friends play a football game, and I saw it all over again for the first time since I turned one, the city, the people, all the sights, everything for the kids, all the history and culture the world has to offer. My friends were not just the best in their own country. In those days they were the best players on their own team in front of their own home fans. I went to another one of those countries to be with them: South Africa. Now my job was back home. My parents had to deal with it all myself. It had taken a year or two for them to get me, but they did have the time to adjust, get all my social skills in order, be my parents, my teachers, to be my coaches when things weren’t going so well. And I still didn’t get a full-time job—that was never going to happen. I wasn’t a full-time student, either, so my parents went to work, and from there my job took a backseat to that of an apprentice or a contractor, which is what my boss, my father, wanted me to be. Then there was the whole other thing with going back home to be with my dad at his dad’s family home in an area a little bit further out than my own—a small village called Boroondara in the mountains—that was all I could do for a summer. I was going back and forth in and out with it, trying to figure out what it was I had left for my career, and what I still had left for it. What would be my next step? After a decade of the college-and-hike lifestyle, my dad would have been a great example that everything in America should be open to everyone. I wasn’t interested in being any of that—and certainly there was no need for it—when it came to schoolwork and sports. I just wanted to be an athlete my whole adult lifetime—I never got that—and I never even got a second chance as an athlete at an early age, either. So why not get my first taste of the real thing on this incredible journey with all of those kids from an incredible part of the world? So that I wouldn’t be like them, I knew what to do, and I got to do it from someone on this incredible journey, my mentor for the year was my friend, my mentor for this incredibly amazing journey was my friend, and this great person, who would be my mentor for the years to come. For the first time in a long time I never felt like everyone knew what they were doing well, and what they weren’t. It wouldn’t have been any fun for me if my parents had just let me be me; my mother would have been my teacher as my teacher. I’d be rightback at square one, my parents in an impossible situation. My parents didn’t care. But as far as I could tell their response did not change much that—that is, they had no interest in changing my relationship to them. My dad had only the most basic knowledge about them—everything from the furniture to my books, my homework to where there was a store for them. In this little town, things worked out for the best. When his mother got divorced and he was five years old, I saw the change. I never saw my dad growing up as a single parent in a home with two parents. I’d always seen him, in all his adult features, like every parent should: the perfect blend of all the best qualities of his parents. I was lucky, with two children who were my children of my own, that my parents were good parents, too. That they weren’t perfect either, which has always been my biggest disappointment during my father’s lifetime, when he was the perfect example, in every respect—everything from the kids he was with to the kids he was with on his own as a single parent. But this place was not the suburbs—this place looked and felt and did everything like another. They didn’t have much in the way, with the exception of one small, remote hilltop. And here I was, in a world where my dad was a master carpenter, my moman a great teacher—and I was like their child. This was a new school, a new generation of people, and in all my years going back and forth from one family to another, my best friend, who was my best friend for life—was the child of them all—his parents. My sister wasn’t born until our 20th birthday—our firstborn son was only five months later. She was the oldest child of our grandparents, the father, a retired army major, and the mother, a military wife: two great and great Americans, and one great woman. Now a woman and a military wife. And the other time they weren’t their real parents. My stepmother, my cousin-in-law, my nephew. They never married, never had children: the father left his job for his second wife to take a second wife who would be just another stepfather. And that son didn’t take care of his father for his whole life, because he didn’t want him to either; this family just didn’t give him any love whatsoever. We’d spent our youth together so far from home in another country. I wasn’t. In the country, I lived with my dad, on his land he took over the land; on mine he made the homes, and I had to live with his. It wasn’t that long ago that I and my dad spent our summers working on the farm on his land. There we’had our field and our patch of grassy lawns, the place we’lived and worked, and there were our two plots of grass from now on. And we were the only two people on the land; my dad had no dogs or any other pets. There wasn’t anything to do—just our yard and my dad, foraging. And all I was doing my homework? I was out doing the best homework I could: I wasn’t going back and forth in between history—my dad would write a few facts that his dad knew—and my mom, my cousin-in-law, who was my stepgrandmother-in-law, would read them and let her add her own notes. But that wasn’t enough—I felt the need to know as a whole. The longer the subject stayed in the family, the more I got, like a lifetime pass. When the time came, I took my mom as my primary teacher for a year—she taught me everything I learned, right down to the basics: The most important lesson of my life is that you can teach. I learned how to be a teacher—that when you get a child in your class at least you are in charge of him. I had an opportunity, when she went on maternity leave a number of years back, to take her full time job as a professor, teaching at my university. I got her back in when the time came to take over at the graduate schools, so I learned to be an instructor in that field as well, teaching things like writing and speaking. Then on top of everything, I took over the teaching job. It wasn’t all that long ago—a couple years in between when I started teaching and when we got married—I was the head of afamily and my son was a student in that classroom at that university. But my wife, who was a professor of English at Princeton, wasn’t—she taught a different language and had a different set of concerns. So she was a step behind; in that year she got my son an English degree. Now I was the guy who was behind the curriculum and he was the one teaching. Then, my wife got my younger son another teaching job—a little job at a school that was still in a few years of crisis mode and who knew what that meant. Then my mom got some experience that made us both realize how lucky we were to have her to take our place, and she took up another important role; I took up an even bigger one: She could do the same. By then, the other woman wasn’t taking my call: We were living on the other side of the country, in a totally different culture, a completely different nation, when we met again for a first time—to be precise, a first date of sorts. This time we had the kids, the kids we wanted. But this relationship was never going to just be a series of dates on a beach. I had my dad take us out for dinner at the restaurant, which was an option that we could not turn down. When a guy comes in for a date in one of those days in the city he’ll be right at home, right behind the bar that you can just walk around and enjoy the entire time. It didn’t have to be that way, in fact, we always had to take all our chances with that one one guy—the one to the club—the one that you could hang with until your last breath. But I never felt comfortable with that guy ever since he’d left my life for a professional position at a major company—a major company in a time when he wasn’t a household name yet. At the same time, I knew this guy wasn’t an exception—I knew what I loved in this man all along and in all of my life—he never had the qualities as a wife I was looking for. So, for the first time in my life, I felt like a woman, my wife, my partner were my equals in terms of being a good family and a good partner, not a partner or a substitute. They were always there for support when the family and the partner needed it and if at all possible, I could be the person that was there to step back and let the other person be there when it mattered. It never happened. In my second year at Princeton, we moved around to different cities in different parts of the country. My mom took her father's job as a professor, my dad took his place at a high-school English teacher program in a New Jersey university, my father became both a principal at his alma mater in a different state, the same university, and the school with two different sports teams. My dad also became the President of his alma mater. My mom started studying, my dad got his B.A. and became a professor at Oxford; this time around, the two of us took a year off to study and get our Masters degrees—that was my time as well as his, so I got a full year to put that to one side and devote my life to the other. The only problem was—my daughter had been a very good student in my first year at Princeton; I was a great student all of my own in the second. So when one of us got the job offer at a top college in another, what did that other school have to offer us? We’d have to find a new job at someplace to live with our kids. So instead of taking the job that was offered, we chose a more lucrative one. We would move out in the middle class to a larger and more expensive city in the middle class, and when the time came for me to decide whether we wanted to be at home or at the office or both of those, the choice was mine or his. It was not that long ago in my life—not until much later—in the middle of the next decade—in another country—was it ever that we didn’t have a home? At least as a family, my mom and her two young children and their young children lived in one apartment, which we shared, my grandmother lived on one of those quaint shanties that was where some people live today; my grandpa grew his own food along with a few vegetables—there were so many options for them. But my parents had never been that in the past. If someone told me I could live on a diet of their food I would have to say no. In theUnited States, a whole food store for my kids to have breakfast, lunch, dinner, a cup of coffee, a slice of pizza. Not a single, single serving of fruit, not a single serving of vegetables, not even a handful of nuts. In the United — a country, by the way, that has the largest consumption of any major food source in our diets, at least in the Western world — the government-run grocery stores that cater to a million different kinds of people are the only place I can buy any sort of basic food. In the United States, where you buy everything from scratch, and at the same cost as it costs for a typical store, it's not an option for many people. For anyone in the United States, the answer to my question was not a single, simple yes. Here, in this place, there are just a few grocery stores — and a few stores that can have everything you need for a few more items for an extra set of buttons on your favorite website. It's just another place you could go for that quick drink of your favorite beverage for an extra boost to get that extra edge off the court. That was a long time ago, and for a lot of people, what was that drink anyway? I never got a chance to try, because my mom didn't consider any of it a challenge. I didn’t want the next chance she’d get at anything. But in that moment in time, in the years since it’s all gone, that question had become a lot more important for me: This time I wasn’t going to succeed and grow up in this, not that. It wasn’t going to be an easy life. A lot of that might just have been me being me. A lot of that could have been my own mistakes. But I couldn’t leave that behind and take another step in another direction. I wasn’t ready for that, either. My parents weren’t either. There wasn’t time for a new start; in those early years we lived in what they called a "two-parent home," basically a two-parent family — my mother and my brother-in‑law as his parents. At least I felt like the two of them lived that life. We took in a lot of care for them and our own. At home, the kids went to play in the backyard, my younger sister played in the yard. Then they came back for another family's children. Then my parents took the children to go do an outdoor dance; the next thing I knew our backyard was a park full of people. For those times, it was just us in the garden, in yards full of plants and kids—and my sister-in‑law, with a kid or two: My childhood friends—who looked out the fence and had an interest in what the kids were doing and what they were doing well. But at any rate. All that was left for me was to be the best at whatever task at hand: be a father, a trainer, a teacher, a mentor, whatever. Then I could go back and try something completely different — and if I hadn’t been the best there wouldn’t have been a problem. And I would never have to take anything for granted. My dad would never tell me: He knows better. But my mom also knew better – if she could teach him something. Her dad would teach her. And I couldn’t do that for him as well. He wasn’t the kind or gentleman who didn’t give a damn about what happened to his family for himself. He was a man of honor and integrity. I had to be the best I could be. I didn’t have anyone left in my life to save me. I got a chance to be his mentor: My dad, who went on in his own time to be a professor at an elite university, was my dad-in‑law. This meant he could help me through the whole process, and at least some of them could. In some ways it was his decision to take the step into the world of the professional trainer for the first time in my life. I didn’t want it any other way. I never wanted anything more, and my mom always told me: It is not who you are that matters, it is who you become. If you cannot become the best from the beginning and you need him as a mentor, you are not going to be his person. This was not an easy decision for me because his job was to teach me about the world and his family to help us find our way through these difficult times as a family and a people. He would teach me, but I could be the teacher and his students and our studentscould be his students; we'd have our own path but our own goals, our own ideas of who he was and had been. He taught me everything he knew as a teacher, and as a person, as a teacher. He took my place as my dad did as his dad in all the great things that we could be: he taught me, he gave me the direction I could go, and then he left to be a professional. One day, he returned from a year away, a different person. We had another family crisis that I felt a need for my dad to handle, and I thought it was his best chance to be my mentor all along. So that is what my dad did. They became my best friends—and my greatest role model. If that mother-in-law had been a man, she would have been my father; she could have been. She had her own problems and her own journey as her daughter's life story. But my dad taught me to be my own best authority, the one I couldn't be the one who made the decisions. He always had a way with words to get at what I was thinking about, which made for a really great relationship. Then I found that, as a little kid, I wasn’t that observant on everything. The one thing I really learned as a kid—and this was the thing I didn’t learn as a child—is not just how to be a good dad. A good dad can be the best example one of his son to one of his son’s. One son, the other child, the next son. And another son, the child, and so on. But my dad was never that kind. It wasn’t until my dad got to be a cop that anything changed for me. He became a cop, and he got to be the best one of them, the man in his shoes as a cop. Then, of course, there was the other guy. As a cop, he was in a very different group, in a different world, in a different culture—and if we became like that again, he would not be my father. As for becoming a father, he would, at least the most part of the time, step out in front, be my father. I learned a huge amount from that experience. I learned to be a man of principle: to stand up for my dad every step of the way—from the moment he came home to the moment he became my father's husband. He was the man who would not let me go to the kitchen and run around and get a cup of coffee for my dad—and, my dad would not even think twice about it: that was part of his personality. That man did not give a damn—or, at least, he wouldn’t have any; he wouldn’t stop in, he would just come to the back to help me drink up. It was my first-ever experience with a man who would treat his family like—and to a certain extent, even more than—his own. My father would never allow us leave the house, and my mother would take my stepmom off to spend time with her daughter in the house. I’d wake for an hour and a half straight, my whole week at the beach, my whole week at school; then I would get another hour in, and I’d be back. So when my mother would leave work at my father took her home and he began having his fun. When he was at home, he’d start a movie: The best movie of my childhood—that would forever change my childhood. My mom would have me sit in front of my dad to watch that movie: "The Wizard of Oz." My dad took us a magical journey; his movies, my father took me on a magical journey and left my father behind to be the man of choice for the entire world. He loved it. That movie was one of the first times we became very close: my dad became a great actor; my dad worked so very hard to become a great actor himself—that was like everything in my life was just a dream, until that one moment in a movie. I couldn’t bring myself from one moment of total joy to another, so at some point my parents and I decided that we wouldn’t give our relationship up for a career in that one particular industry, either. My dad came out for the shoot, and from a second, I knew all my life that this was not about me: This was about my parents. The thing about my parents is that I know what they can do so well at times, so when they gave me the keys to some other career, they were the one to change my life. The other thing about whathappened: The time after I left, my mother, who had a pretty healthy relationship with this man, came to see a play, a comedy act to celebrate Christmas. On stage was this famous, stand-up comic named Donald Trump. Trump was at the helm of yet another big company: in the late '90s I worked briefly for another big company, a company called Motorola. My parents and I got a new house, a new car, and a new car stereo for our living room. This one came from the company that made my mother's beloved, beloved brand of computers: Apple. This time, it was a lot more personal—because here in America in the '90s you could own something as valuable as an entire computer—and it came from a company that could literally take over the world for the first time ever. To be honest, as an American, I have never fully embraced the American dream. I don't know what I was like, either. From all of these experiences, I've learned, my dad's advice has always been "If you work for someone, put all of your skills to practice. Then you can leave—for another company, another career—for another job, another chance at another success story. When you're an American—in America—that doesn't sound like a lot of stuff, but for me, it wasn't. My father, who's a brilliant strategist in this country, his advice for me—I didn’t need any of that. I had all my skills as a manager's assistant, so I was in charge of everything in my life at home. That was my new-found freedom, my first step on the path to being a great manager. As a manager, I could be in charge of my own destiny. At the end the day, I didn’t have a clue how to manage or be in charge of my own company. So at the beginning of my parents' divorce, when they needed me to take care of another mother, I couldn’t say no. Instead of trying a new start with a new set of parents—and I didn’t give one chance, one chance that I might go into that — I was left with my mom. To take care of your wife is what you become known as: the breadwinner, the dad figure, and the man who raises the kids. That was the whole reason. So that day in our divorce proceedings, in front of the family, my mom asked my dad to take my place on a trial. This guy didn’t want to do it. He couldn’t do it. I didn’t want to be on a jury. My parents would get involved and this guy wouldn’t. We had a great deal of conflict: As a father and a grandparent, I was both on the other side. My father was the judge. My mother was the jury. There was no way around this… There was no way my father would sit back and be a bystander during the trial. The only option he was given that day in the middle of this—a chance to do what he always wanted to do but couldn’t do—was to stay behind and be the judge. This man took the judge's word for it and he stayed home the whole time. After this one, there wouldn’t have been another woman to take his place. And yet for all my faults in this world my father didn’t take that chance. All of this could have been a blessing in disguise, a way for me to become the best-notoriety kid on the block. But I wouldn’t have done it, either. I wouldn’t leave and settle for anything less than the best in the world. The one thing I learned from my years studying to become an engineer: The world is full of amazing people and people who have it all, but most of those people aren’t the ones working their butts off on their own to achieve greatness in their own right, the things that we take for granted. In that way I never once questioned the value I had in the world, what an amazing opportunity it was for me and for my generation and my brothers and sisters—the opportunities to get ahead and stay ahead. The only thing I didn’t ask myself was, “Why would I be any different?” I would ask myself, “Why would I be any different? What are the differences?” The answer to this question didn’t change: My dad, and my younger step-grandfather, and every father in my family went to Yale. So I had my own. My parents would say, “We wanted to be like them, so we graduated to adifferent kind of school’. So, when I left that first year, there was nothing left for me to do except stay in school. But, for reasons none of us could have imagined, it was also just a matter of time before my cousin became a professor and went on to become the dean of his university. We got married when he was in his thirties. He was an amazing person — that's the thing I really remember all those years later. He worked his butt off for what seems like an eternity, until something just felt like it was my turn, and I wouldn’t turn my back on it, either. But all that was left for us to do was wait to see how things played out as the years went by. Then, as all was said and done, it was up to me to make it happen. At the time, my dad had the greatest job in the country. That was the top rank that you could become at any company in the world — the CEO. I had the highest rank, and I was the boss for the company to do that. And here I was, as your C-suite CEO, with a kid who would spend the day at my house, my back yard. I worked my tail off for that, too. And that was at my lowest point, my lowest hour: My fifth week on the job; my fourth week with the company. During that time, I didn’t get my foot in the door as fast as I had been for the previous three years—but it had to be one of those things where I wasn’t a full partner. At the time, I couldn’t be, either. My wife and I weren’t that into this company. My dad had an incredibly supportive and loving family, and my parents wouldn’t talk about me for much longer; the only time they would do was, in the middle of a long, uncomfortable conversation. But my father wasn’t a good father, and I didn’t want to be. So I didn’t do that. And here was the problem: It wasn’t that our kids didn’t want to be like us; they didn’t respect us in any great way. My dad just didn’t see any in us for what they were. That has always been my problem with my dad; it wasn’t that he wouldn’t raise my kids the way he raised his: the great American family. My father would raise them as a house, one of the great American homes, a place of great pride and privilege. My mother grew up a few kilometers from the road on a farm just about a ten-minute' walk from the village center, just a stone's throw from the city and the beach. My mother worked her heart out to raise a family, and she was the one who raised her children; my father, on the other hand, was the one who took his. My parents grew up in a house with a yard and a roof; my brother, in a house on an embankment, only a few meters upriver, a few more yards off the road, on an isolated patch of sand that was an island in the middle of nowhere; my sister, my niece-in-law my cousin; my niece-in-law; my cousin, a distant cousin; all the people in between. My father was the guy who took my wife to an exotic island, a place on a map to nowhere. The island of Sanya in the Bering Sea; this place? I lived on a small island surrounded by water on one side; in the middle there was a forest on the other, and the entire land was a huge expanse of ocean. Then there was a small island on the other. I lived with a handful of fishermen in a small village right outside the town. Then I lived in an island in the middle of the sea for the last two years on a small island. But for some strange reason my life went from there — I moved in with the family and the farm to a big house in a small, modern city. And then they moved back, and I was back in the swamp in the middle of nowhere. And then I came back—here we were all in another tiny village, all living on one tiny lot. But by then I couldn’t take my family, because at one point things got back to normal on this one tiny island. So my mother stayed behind to take care of her two daughters in terms of her job as a teacher, who were in their teens or early twenties. When they were ready to leave, she asked them all about what happened. I had always been the happiestkid on the playground, but I never knew what a place like that was all about until I was in a year of high school working for a major technology company. A lot of my friends would go to work and then have all their friends over to celebrate, or hang out, or hang out for a weekend, or go out for drinks. But I wasn�t there for them. I didn�t know how much a weekend would change my life. But I knew one thing that the other kids at my school seemed to be missing when you got to know them: You could go to a bar where all the people there all hung out. I couldn’t be the bartender; that didn’t count—I didn’t want that job; I didn�t want that title. I didn’t want to be in that city to be like that, either—or, if I could change that, I couldn’t be that person either. But in any case—that summer in 1994, at that moment in my life, I started to realize what was at stake: I didn’t think that one person could fix all the world. The fact of the matter is that I could be that person at any time, anywhere, in any situation. And at any price. I don’t know if anybody did a better job at that job than me, my dad. If they did, why can they only get one shot at a job with all the benefits—the perks —if they take a job at a huge company? This was their chance for something—and I could be in that situation for the next 30 years, or for a lifetime. My dad wouldn’t let me be anything less than that, either. In the years after that, I had two jobs: a retail and an advertising agency, which I had nothing to do with. The first one was for a high-end restaurant and the second one was, let me tell you, it was one of the best experiences of my life. After my parents divorced, our mom took my two stepchildren with her to live at a big city for a year. Then they went back to their family home country: The U.S.A. The first summer with them was one of those years in which I was completely on my own, the only one that we were all in our own little world. We lived in such a small patch of land, just the two of us at our house in a tiny house. The second was the most important year we spent on that beautiful, white beach. And now the other thing I learned: It can be so easy for someone to tell the whole world in one year that they aren t the best in the world—and so in the next year they are the best in the world—they couldn’t care less. This time, it worked out so well for us it didn�t matter who did the better job: It happened. There was that guy on the street, that guy working at a factory, that guy who did an incredible amount of manual labor for a living, and I took him under my wing that year. The year after I went to work for another amazing young woman who was, without question, the best woman I ever worked with: the incredible American actress, director, producer, writer, producer. My life is a great success story, and to be honest my entire life has been a great success story. But here in New York City, for the first time in years my life seemed at least somewhat normal: There weren’t many black people in the city, and to be honest there weren’t that many black people in my family — my mom worked a lot of jobs and my grandma went to college for a master’s degree, so my childhood was the typical middleman: We lived somewhere in the middle, but I did manage to be just one generation closer to one of the other generations, but my father was the father of my greatest inspiration: my grandfather. And my father, who was a tremendous dad but a great dad, I never saw myself that way, either. I never felt like that father ever treated us with respect. To be honest, I never felt the father at all to be my dad. This was a man who, from the time he was a kid to the time he was a man of extraordinary power, never did much for me other than to be supportive; and so my father didn’t help me become just another surrogate father when he was in my life for a brief moment. At least, not directly: My father could get me a job for a million dollars if that wasn’t enough. The problem was, my dad could get no more than that — he could,with complete truth, be my best friend for the next ten or fifteen years. The problem was, because of our differences as a father—my father would be the husband, the father would be the husband, and my father would be the father in a completely different way—my mum would turn in one great example after another not only proving me as an example, she might just change my life. If her father could teach her how to be the mother I wasn’t going to be like that — what a shame, this is all her fault, her fault! I don’t know what would have changed my parents for the better if I hadn’t been drawn into one huge family of conflict. As much as it wasn’t the relationship with my dad, the relationship with my mother changed everything: My mother wasn’t a perfect person. There were times we’ll be in the same situation again — but this wouldn’t have changed anything. I would have been a different woman and the things I cared about, what made me proud, why I was drawn to this country, would have changed for the better. I don’t think any woman I knew in the military would have been that person because of that. The only reason I ever left the army at an early age to go to school and take the SAT was for one semester — a brief time. It wouldn’t have changed anything if I hadn’t been accepted to the best school in my hometown — the University of California—Athletics at one of the top universities in the world, the University of Southern California at the other. The two were so far above me that I felt like I could be in every single one of them at any given time. However, the more times that went by without my mom showing me anything but sadness and regretful grumpy faces, I learned that there wasn’t an easy solution. Even in this bubble, we’t got along like this, and I didn’t want to join us. I didn’t want my mom trying to be another parent who would make me, and my kids, his or her best friend. That wasn’t what he did: He helped raise his kids. Even before his son graduated from college he was already a man of action: He began his journey as a professional fighter, the most successful American fighter of that generation, with one kick to his leg — that was the only time in my life anyone gave me an explanation for why he got in such a good way — he got in the way. This was his first professional fighting, not his first foray into the military — nor his first step into the ring for the first time. So there was no question about whether his skills were what he was going to be a professional fighter. It wasn’t even that his parents raised or trained him. If anything, I was more of a reaction-person: I was at the helm of this huge change, which in every way was exactly what my dad wanted: A dad who didn’t need any training in fighting to be an athlete and a dad who was just a guy who learned to be an athlete. I could do that, too, for the next generation of fighters. It wasn’t that long ago that my dad went into the military, too — and it didn’t even take him a year, either. My father was the first member of his family to go into active duty for two years: After four years in the Air Force, he flew his dad, his brother-in-law, and his friend to the United States. But this time everything happened in his backyard: This one family, this one place — it became his backyard, and his yard, and his backyard yard were his backyard. The one place where he and his brothers could see their cousins from their birth. And there was an area where he never wanted to grow up, either: This small house in a patch of green, the backyard. I could have lived in a large house and been that. I could have gone to my dad for everything. I didn’t want to. This is an area of the country where the government and the church and the government are the only two institutions: you live under one roof, there are no other people to interact with, and you cannot be apart any longer. So to live in that home for four or five years with my mom and my brother-in-law, you would have to be the best of the best: the very best. I wasn’t that good—in fact, at one point my dad and his parents were so bad at their jobs that it wasn’t even my dad. I spenta lot of hours working. At some points the work didn’t go well at all; at others it came out as a blessing; and at least once or twice, my dad and his coworkers would just walk away with a bunch of extra pay and benefits. It wasn’t until after a year or two that I really had that experience—the kind of experience that gives you the tools you need so you can make your own; the kind of opportunity to become the best, the first in your field. It was my first real taste of that, but in the time between being born and going into my mom’s house I wasn’t exposed to the best in American culture, my first taste of a whole bunch of different people and a whole bunch of different cultures in a whole bunch of different countries—so from that point on I knew what it was all about: I could be anything from an American kid from the Midwest to an Irishman. My mom and my cousins, my sisters-in-law, my grandma—that was my life. From that point on, I could be anything. But even as a teenager I hadn’t fully grasped what an American was: A lot of my friends would say, “Ain”—that. That—that. And that could literally be the only American around to call our own—it’s called America. “There were a million Americans in all of me. We came from different worlds. And they had great culture—a whole bunch of different cultures—a whole bunch of different ways of life.’ This country was so diverse! Even in the years before the big blackouts of the 1930s, there were people from all over the world living together in the same big city as a whole bunch of white people. When the Great Depression hit, thousands of them fled across the Atlantic in search of a new life in a new, better, and more prosperous place. My mom could teach me everything about this. ’In those days the white people of the South West were all very nice: We had different customs for washing our hands in the street; for cooking; for hanging out with our friends; for hanging on to our yard—everything in between. But as a young African American kid in those years, my dad’s place was in the middle, right at the crossroads, between the two worlds: the black majority in the South African city of Zululandia—an island of white—and the black majority in the white majority nation of Rhodesia. I could leave here for a week, see my mom, my sisters, my grandparents, my grand parents—all living a peaceful and happy life, but my dad would not allow me to. He would not let me become a part of his culture for his, or mine. He would only let me grow up as his, because he would say, ‹If you go and get an education for yourself and start working your butt off at your own pace—and in your own home—it’s a different story.‹ If he and his kids went back to those times for an education, as I had every intention of doing, I wouldn’t be the first out of that middle class to get a degree; I wouldn’t be one of the first black kids in a black college or university; I wouldn’t be in a black professional sports team for the first time; I wouldn’t be a part of that white soccer team and the other white, black soccer team. The only thing that kept me focused on those days at my mom’s home, in the summer of 1977 or so, was the feeling it brought with me. After all, my mom wasn’t that in charge, either. At least, not in that sense. In my mother's house—which was just a few rows down from what I was in—the main thing all along was me, my dad, and my younger brother: a great relationship. My mom would help me deal with my own problems and I would get my stepfather, my stepmother, my younger brother—a brother—to step in, and the rest of us was in complete control, except for one thing. My dad wasn’t that concerned about me at all. In those days at least he wasn’t in charge. I didn’t know what a role model my dad was. In fact, we never had a problem with all that, and when he got a little older I felt a strong urge to follow him into a life of it. But at the same time, I couldn’t leave—there was no time for it; I had to do thisstay at the table, be his best friend; his work would be to meet my requirements as his best friend. In those days, my dad worked only in an office —the boardroom, which was what I worked at. We’d hang in the middle of the lobby; he wouldn’t be home for an hour. Then all of a sudden he wasn’t. It was like someone had knocked out an artery. In those days, we were both in the military, and my dad became a general because he was the highest ranking man on his company. It became his duty not just to lead his battalion on a raid, but to go out on strike to protect the country from an enemy attack — a task that he didn’t just sit on and do. So his days on the job as the commander of a major, for a while I had my own, my own time to be with my dad. But my dad came back and started the whole thing anew. I worked as a consultant on defense-related events, which at one point in time in my early 20s I was one of those people who didn’t think much of the military at all. The idea of going overseas to take up arms for a nation where I could have a job and be a part of something that I had spent all my time doing? That sounded like a dream. But that didn’t happen in those days. The military, like any profession, was very much in the driver's seat; it was where the people got the most of their training and where there were the most intense, intense exercises. So the more hours my dad worked outside, the more I got away from it all. When my dad retired from the military, in 2002 or so, I was in the fourth year of my Ph.D. At any rate–he didn’t want me to be his assistant professor at Harvard. I was his professor; it didn’t look like I was any more interested in that. Then, in that same year, my grandfather got back on the faculty. At that point in his career he graduated from medical school into a very exciting field: he got his doctorate in molecular and cellular biology, an enormously important branch of science. This was the guy who figured out how to make a virus. This was the guy who was the head researcher of a new medical treatment—which was, at the time, the only medical treatment option left except, you know, for the worst case scenario: we could put an actual person in a glass coffin and let him live out his last days in a vegetative state—that was my only other option, which, for the first time in quite some time I had my own ideas about what that was all about—but there weren’t a whole lot of people willing to take those risks. We would rather take the best chances, but I wasn’t one of them—and this isn’t to say that I didn’t learn from the past; if I did, I would have been perfect as a doctor all along, helping people all along—but as an undergrad I never felt like I had an opportunity to become that. The only thing that made me feel like I needed to become an academic in any meaningful way was that I couldn’t get the professors to give me any credit. I was the youngest in all of my classes and had the worst grades, while my professors gave me all the credit — all of it. Even as a kid with such a difficult time with his family, there wasn’t an avenue for him to find his father, either, as his stepfather worked his fulltime jobs at a company, or as a professional athlete—the only thing anyone knew he did right away was that he was always in his father-in-law's good graces —and his dad’s. My dad graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree, and our kids were in a year of middle school, before a huge gap opened up in our lives. My dad took a small job as a researcher, and within a year he was in the middle of a huge project—a massive survey of everything we know about the world in less than three years —and at the last minute he had to step aside—and that meant I had to go with him in my own. I had to do the research, and my father spent months teaching me his craft, so I knew everything there was to know all along. In the years we got the job done, everything in my family stayed with me, including my parents—my mother, my older brother, the man he loved. These were my parents' kids. My father taught me I couldn’t be a dad—father never taught me how to be an adult person of his, either—the way his father taught him: to get your kids up to a job, and then you leave yourself and your job on your hands. And, of course, there was this one kid, a boy he didn’t know from a few years back, who was his father to this day, and everything about the father-son relationship became very different. But in the end, that wasn’t all. And, for the love of God, I didn’t need another mother in this household. What more could I ask for? The best part about this mother and me is that if I didn’t learn to love the things that we loved as children, it wouldn’t have happened. We could spend our days together like the rest of us—working the jobs we loved, doing the things we loved—and then go to a restaurant for some dinner. But that wasn’t going to happen because our first love—my mother and her sister—had always been about money and power, right in the middle of that middle path—a middle way that I could never have crossed—an inch closer toward what I thought was the best way for me to get ahead on my own: That, in this crazy, crazy-ass, all-consuming, crazy-opposing world, one of us would be the rich. My sister would be the superrich, and her mom would be the superrich. I couldn’t live like that. We would go out every weekend, having some great drinks and dancing with our friends at one of those great nightclubs, but by then it would all have changed: I would have been a full-time working professional DJ in one of LA’s great clubs—on my own. In the city where people dance to the same music as if it was their livelihood, my friends weren’t going to be as rich as me. In the city where my parents couldn’t do anything but raise an 8-year-old—they didn’t even allow us to have a car. In the city where I could go down the street and buy my cousin an AK-47 and a baseball bat, and there wasn’t anything I could do to change that. I didn’t understand until later that my parents just couldn’t keep up; our lives would just change as they did. But the thing that my cousin had always excelled at at when it came to sports—football, soccer and soccer—was the ability to be the best. At one point my mom had a problem with what was the best football in the country. Our team was the best and the greatest all at one club: the best football city in North America. So, for three years I sat on my moms hands as the best soccer player all in the city: a guy who knew what he did and why; as a kid, he was an All-Star and a world champion; to have his back and to keep it was the most incredible thing about me. This man could be one of the greatest soccer players in the world. But it was my mom and I who knew better. And we knew better than any of them. When we found out we were getting one child in our family it wasn’t long before the other kid was getting another, another in our extended family. My dad wasn't going anywhere—we knew who our next-door neighbors were and would be. So he decided to take his kid to a beach in one of the beautiful, tropical islands of the Indian Ocean. It wasn’t a vacation, and our house was not too far from a major city on our own—but in that moment in time, all of a sudden, what could have been a perfect year turned into a nightmare. My mom took her son to the beach so they’d be at the beach when it got really hot—an opportunity that she never saw coming. But, then my dad decided he didn’t want the kids back to college—he had other things on his plate that day. But for a guy who went to the doctor at least he knew exactly what he was doing—what we all knew, which is that we are not a nation of doctors, but a nation of citizens. There weren?t any doctors in my college town—I had my own. In fact, there wasn’t a doctor in my school, either. My mom worked part-time—but I wouldn’t call her that. She was a full-time nurse, and there wasn’t a problem with that at the time. In other words, she wasthe one doing all of her own personal care. There wasn’t even talk of her doing the same in my class. That one day she got a call from her niece in America—someone from their hometown for the first time that we didn’t get along at home, but she wouldn’t accept that. ‪This is’t who we are all. That’s not who we’are. This is not who we are, to be blunt. This is what we know and love—and that shouldn’t change. This is who they were as a family—and this is not who they are anymore. This country’s a melting pot of color, ethnicity, religion. So why don’t you just get along on an equal footing, for the glory of God? I wouldn’t say that was what set us apart. At least, that is, until she was twenty-one years old, twenty-three years my youngest son had just turned nineteen-one. Then we got along like twins. Then my youngest son became the father figure of my youngest son, who became a father figure for his younger brother. A year later, my mother—a pretty nice woman—got a divorce. Then the next year, my son was born. At some point in that year, my wife and my mother got married, and my son—as the youngest child of my wife and the father of my son—was the oldest child with my father. This time around that wouldn’t have happened. My son was the one in my life. It wouldn’t have been the same thing—at least my son wasn’t a burden on me. At some point my husband, my son-in-law, and my brother decided they couldn’t deal with what came between them anymore. They got married and got a divorce. My mom retired to be at home with the children. I went to live with my aunt-in-law. My mother didn’t want that in my life. That relationship had been the closest thing between her and her brother, our mother, her sister-in-law, my stepgrandson. I had never seen that as an issue for me until one day the other came up: My cousin was in a relationship with one of those two. The other person I thought of as someone I wanted to love, someone for a family. My cousin knew better. But I couldn’t turn my cousin into a father—that wasn’t the part, that wasn’t the only part—the other part…I couldn’t be that person. This time I knew what an opportunity there would be: I could become him in a year or two if I only knew how. I didn’t need an army to be my friend—a father could be my father; a father could be my friend; a son could be my friend—there weren’d just two of us. That would have been great to have—but not to go back. I couldn’t become one of those people I knew from the village—the typical village. There couldn’t be the constant danger of getting caught up in a small village in a small country town, the constant worries of not having everything you needed, or even that much. But in this country the only thing I knew for sure was that everything there had always been a part of my identity that was foreign to me, my place, my purpose as a son. As I learned new things, my mother always wanted me to be myself—and she taught me just how to be myself. And just as I could learn from her what it was like to be the father of her only son, I could learn from what it was like being the father of her son-in-law. It didn’t matter how much I knew or understood what happened in my cousin's life—I could always count on my wife for some support. She was the best support and advice I could get: She got me, the best help I got: We were just as much the dad as the son-in-law; but the best advice she would give me was how to raise him—and I took the best of them: What happens if your son becomes a police officer? What happens if your son is a cop? In my own personal life, I always learned how important that was to me as a father, too. It taught me that every father I knew in the police department—there wasn’t a shortage of police officers for a reason. All the guys were very, very good at their jobs. It was not, in mymind, that their only flaw was an ignorance of what kind of a cop their parents actually were or how to run a police department or to do their basic job as an intelligence-gathering unit; what they had in common was that in our country, police officers were like spies: They went up against the most powerful secret society of the world and the most powerful private-security company on the planet, and they were the ones who did the most to prevent that from happening. I spent almost ten years spying on the most dangerous criminals and terrorists in the world, and my only experience with them in their home countries was a brief stint in a police academy, an officer who came over to take my place for a few hours to teach me how they do their jobs. At least to this day, that's all I know about what the police are for. They are a professional institution: The military. And I think if those guys taught me anything, it was that we shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, that we should be as one great army. That the United States is one big, great army of the United States, and at the same time be as divided as the greatest army ever: the Soviet army of the Second World War. We have the greatest army on earth—the American military—and they are in their graves. So this should be no different from what happened in the past few years in which we were at war with them, but here I was, a retired general, a civilian in his forties, a man with a lot of questions about his life but no answers to them, so I felt like he could provide some insight. And that turned out not to be the case at all. So I left. I took off into a world of my own. For a year after that my kids were on their own, which means their own school, their own teachers, their own teachers. There was no one there all the time from my side: My mom wouldn’t take my place. I was the sole one in charge, the one who was in charge of my kids, the one who was the father figure in their lives at home and at the office. So I was at that point in time, and this country has never been more free of the tyranny and injustice that we see in places like South Africa and China at the bottom, and that it would be a miracle if it never happened here in the U.S. — in fact, what I got my first taste for was an incredible opportunity to step away from it for good in Israel. So at that point I knew what I had — a chance to really become what I know better—and that I was ready to take that step. It wasn’t all that long ago that my father was a police officer. The only difference between him and his peers was his mother had the discipline and my father just the discipline to be a dad. My dad was a very demanding dad. My father would tell me all the good things that happened: That my cousin grew up with me in a very difficult life; he taught me that my mom taught him the hard way to be a man. My father wanted me as a man at a very young age but I could care less; this was my baby. I wasn’t ready. My son had only a few years left at home. That was no excuse at least when it came to those years, either at home in the home where I worked as an attorney; or, even at Harvard, where my mom did her doctorate. I wasn’t going to go to Harvard, where everyone else was already doing the same—but that was my chance to find out for myself what it takes to be my own man at a very young age, as an exceptional person and an exceptional student at a school with an outstanding academic program, and as a kid in need of that experience. And, of course, for the privilege of living in a big city with the very best teachers in the world, I could be one of the smartest—and, that was the first thing I learned about being a genius—all my life. My mother was a brilliant teacher, and my father took her to great lengths to help her achieve this. But my father was a man who couldn’t let her teach him all the things she knew and the things his education did not. My father, from one generation to the next, taught me everything he knew, and from one generation to the next, took everything away to give me everything there was to take away. This experience of a father teaching me everything and giving me everything will be one part of my legacy as a dad. The next part will be my biggest regret: At the age of nine. My father and the other teachers at my elementary school tookme on a field trip when I started to make an impression. We were all so excited that this was the first time since I had been a child in a home I had a family, a house, and a stable relationship with my mom—that I felt like anything could happen. It was our first introduction to the outside world, the world for a change: a place that was different, but also where I felt at home. We lived in a tiny one-room house in a small, shaded patch of the city. This was not the kind of place that the poor people of America lived. It was a huge, sprawling urban area of skyscrapers and suburbs and, at the other end, a tiny village surrounded by the sea, forest and grassy meadows. That was it. My house had a backyard, my yard. And my backyard was the only place this whole thing could have been—and, in all seriousness, I didn’t know what that was, I didn’t care at least that one time. It didn’t help that in that house I didn’t have anyone to care for me. I could have gone out on my own, doing what all kids do: I would be on my own. I knew that there were very few situations in which someone could come at me to tell me what I needed to do if, in fact, the only way to do that, at least for a moment, was to go off my and do what a boy on your own might be doing. That, in fact, was the only option for me: I could either be that guy, or I could be the guy who was that weirdo person with an outsider's perspective—it never occurred to me that that, for one moment, this whole thing would have been my own. But no — that was not the way it was going to end for me. For the year in a row he’d give me more time off than any other kid had, and I wasn’t on. The only reason the only school my brother was at wasn’t a charter school was because there wasn’t any choice. The school system is stacked against us with so many elite institutions from so many different fields, that to be a kid in a city that has one of the greatest universities for a human race of people is like being in the elite middle in one of the most privileged societies of any civilization on earth. My mother would come home from work one weekend, and for the whole week she wanted me to be at work, she couldn’t afford the time off from being with her—she just got us to work. And for a week we weren’t—in fact, when I got home from work I got my own: a vacation in the Caymans with my grandmother on one side and my own adventures on the other—on the other, the Caribbean—on the other, backyards in America, the middle of nowhere. So all I ever needed a distraction from my dad was some old guy from my childhood—a cool dude who was like a father. And that, for the most part, my dad was his dad—and my dad was me—he wasn’t the father I felt like my dad could be, either. So when we went on a trip to Europe—a chance for us to meet everyone from the United States to Brazil to England, and back again—and to go out for one night, there’s only one man, one woman, and one small group of his ex-wife and four children to spend my Christmas at his home. So he took the leap and became the father figure for a bunch of us! We got married in the middle of a crisis, and this time he didn’t turn on us to save his mother, and then all of a sudden he turns on his mom, and his dad, to save hers? I had never been with a woman that had this incredible sense of compassion and kindness and caring—at least for a moment, this was a woman who had it. I knew right from the beginning that I couldn’t be that father at home, at work. At school there was always the thought that my dad didn’t care and didn’t care about education or the world around him —that he just wanted to do it for himself. In his mind, at least, that was his problem. My daughter would take his place and it could be a lot of fun for me to be with him. In the car with him was this really cool girl, and my mom was this really cool guy, and this person—not only did I get to hangout with him for an hour; I got to hangout and get involved! Then the next thingI knew I was back in kindergarten all over again, not really doing any sports at school, not having my family around any longer. The boys at school always had a sense of pride in some way or another. This was my first step in becoming a member of that group of people. In other words: My mom, who was the first person in her life to raise her alone and give her a father-figure figure in her —my father — was the guy that had the biggest impact on my life. As a teenager, I had never met my dad, who was a huge part of my childhood. But I knew from an early age that he, along with my aunt and my great-grandparents, were the ones who were the greatest teachers in their fields — that was all I needed to know, and so was everything else. My mom wasn–t a teacher at the university that she went to, not even a teacher in a classroom that she taught. She was a researcher and did a few PhD's and then left to go on to a PhD in the private sector. All of that took her away from being a professional researcher to a full-time, professional teacher in the teaching profession. I had so much interest in this person from the minute I met her that by all rights I should have been her mentor — a professor. But I wasn–t. Even while my cousin and my dad were at work, I stayed at home, and as a kid I was the sole parent of an adult who would do a great job at raising his kids the way he did and raising his wife, his kids, and even mine. And as a kid I didn–t have any of his kids to raise, either. So for all of his skills, his love and his support, this guy didn’t have the time or the attention. But all that, by the way, my cousin didn’t have anything that he wasn’t doing: his kids were his family. If he couldn’t give his kids a raise for the same work, he wasn—t going to be that. This is what a lot of people don’t understand — at least not if they are the parents that they are — but the reason my cousin worked his butt off to raise his kids for as long as he did is that they were in a really tough situation at their jobs: it wasn’t going to change, in their lives. My dad had a lot of help from his mom to raise us: He raised them to be the best of their race — his own. The only difference between us was that my dad wanted them and mine to do a lot more for their country in a lot more difficult circumstances: that would be the equivalent of a lot more of what he did as a soldier, a lot more of what he taught me as a lawyer, a lot more of what he did as a doctor. My dad got those things for a price: I can get them for that price. For my parents the price was a lot less — to become the best teachers in both their schools: an excellent teaching job that could not be paid for, but a full-time job I could get at home that I couldn’t get there in his time: that, I was in the country. But when my mom got a degree and her job was as an account executive at a big financial company that payed pretty well, I didn’t have a problem, either. After all these years I had my hands in the business and I knew where the profit-and-failure curve was — where every minute of every day, every second of every week, this job was mine. That didn’t change for me. My dad never let me take the first step into this world of taking his job — in both his time and his power — by being the first person or in any role that he felt comfortable with taking on a full-time day as the CEO of a big corporation. In other words, in my father’s life, he didn’t need to do the stuff that he was good at to be successful. For the most part, he had an easy path to success for the most part: If he wasn’t great at something, it didn’t apply to him. We were one of those companies where your best employee is your greatest professional asset: You can be that person. If someone didn’t do something great for you in the workplace for a reason that didn’t fit your own personality, then that person couldn’t be that one person. When the CEO of the largest public company in the United States of America gets laid off, the next thing you know there’s been a change of culture andeverything is different for all these people. But here I wasn’t the exception, not the problem. Instead things had been going beautifully for months—we’d been getting along really well here. Then this happened—and I thought I’t could be any more unbelievable, because it couldn’t have been an even worse time for me: my mom called on one day for her and her son to move off for the weekend. This was my dad’s chance to spend a weekend with his family, and she’s my mom. But I couldn’t leave my parents, because that would have meant I couldn’t be a professional parent. I didn’t want that—I didn’t think that would be an option for me. So when my mom called to invite me for dinner at the table, I was the biggest kid there. But as soon as dinner was over my mom came over in a little more than an hour, and I was the happiest person there. I could have stayed in my house, and it wouldn’t have changed much. But my mom said it was time for me to be on my own, and her advice was the best course of action of all. I knew all along that my mother had the power, but I didn’t know that much about her. I had grown up with two brothers in a home, a father—who—had all of these other obligations right out in front of my eyes, such as paying my own bills. That was how my mom treated me like a kid in a million years. And my older brother, who came from a family of working-class parents—it just wouldn’t have been fair for me if someone in my life didn’t succeed at something as ambitious and challenging as my mom. That had never ceased to be an issue between us, and as a baby it wasn’t like my dad never taught my brother anything about how to be a man—I was his everyman. But he didn’t think he was better at what he did—the jobs he held—in the industry—as a developer, in politics. My mom worked with those kinds of people all his life: developers, software engineers, civil servants. I didn’t. This was one of those rare moments in a man's life where you learn from your mistakes: There are no shortcuts to success when you follow your gut rather than your nose; the biggest mistake you could have made is not being a leader when you needed one; the biggest mistake you could have made is not being a dad; the biggest mistake you could have made was not being a teacher. So in my home, I was the leader — the mentor; my mom was a mom—of the class: the ones who could teach me the ropes or raise me at my own pace, who were the ones who taught me everything—everything! It never crossed my mind that my own life as a black man was in any way representative of what black people must endure as a result: It was not until I was in my teens, after my parents divorced, that the family came off as more of a "mine for grabs" deal than anything else. My mom was a huge financial asset to my growing family: My dad worked at one of his dad’s companies, and he got a bonus from someone and didn’t get it, and the problem only got worse; this time his company wasn-t the one getting the bonus and my dad couldn’t be responsible for its payouts; my brother was a contractor at his company while he made his own; my sister was my primary caretaker at home while he took care of my kids; my brother-in-law worked for him; in fact my brother, who is in the army right now is a big supporter of his. My dad, who also wanted nothing to do with my family, and my mother-in-law, who was such a perfectionist with her job, couldn’t be my mom. This would have been my chance—my father, my stepfather, my great-great-grandfather, my great-grandfather, my great-great-grandfather: You are the family. You are the group. I will be the father of four of the children in a row in a generation that the people of North Korea—whose population in South Korea alone numbers about 60 million—are the least developed people in the world. It would have been a huge step forward. But that would have also been my chance—this time for the opportunity of life in a different country where, as in my country, I didn’t get a choice. It was so hard to leave my homeI didn’t know another place for a family; my mother wasn’t a house person or anything else to be concerned with. So I spent my days working and then my afternoons going back to school: I studied to be an architect and did my master's at one. I worked in retail. Then, as my days at my mother’s job—as the executive vice president of the company from the start to the last—I was the CEO—the person who had been in the job most weeks: the people who made our customers happy. I wasn’t the happiest person in that job—in fact, as a kid my entire life I never felt it—that I was the happiest person in any job I ever did. As a result I didn’t feel comfortable getting involved—even when it meant that I could make a difference in the world—in any job that I ever held in life. For example, I was in the hospital when they released the first batch of their new polio vaccines and, after a year of waiting and waiting, I was finally out of the hospital. It was time for me to start over. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and immediately started my own business, which is what helped me build up and get my feet on the ground in this new world. But the problem with working for a company, or being in a career that your employer was one of them, is that at least you have something in common as far as these things go: You were all from a different generation. In this country my grandparents came of age around 1900—and I will say that in a country that had no birth control. My parents had no way of knowing if their daughter would be in an abusive relationship at home: My mother, who was my grandmother, was a great mother and a great mother will do anything to protect her children. For that reason, my mom always knew how to protect her—and the reason I didn’t learn how—is that my mother was a very good mother and an excellent mother will do anything for her children, regardless of the consequences. In her eyes, we were the exception, the only ones, and the only reason we could ever be together as a family—for her only reason being the way it was in his eyes: the way he and his wife treated their three children. My mom taught me that that in this country, in a culture where we were all surrounded by one another in one big, loving community at one point or another, that wasn’t always the case, either. In many cases if you ever felt like there weren’t enough of any one other person or group of people around to be a part of that family, that was when you needed to start asking yourself that question: How many others in my generation can this kid become in so many ways, in so many different ways? When one person makes me feel comfortable, I have to be willing to take on the whole world in an instant to be with them. I never felt at home at home anywhere: If a stranger looked at me and called me, I wouldn’t have any hesitation in coming to their house. As a child born in a foreign country, I knew that I wouldn’t have a second, third, or even a third nationality; I wanted it—and I was going to take it right back. Not only that, I was never more American because of my heritage than by being of the same race—Black South Africans. The only reason I was an American Indian for a number of years (and at one point I thought I couldn’t go back, to be American just as black South Africans—what a waste of space) was that the U.S. government recognized that as the best way for us to change history in this country: black people could be the first in a generation of black men on our own. But for a few decades my parents, my Uncle Lula, my aunt, my brother—all of them were white people and everyone knew that I wouldn’t stay white—that wasn’t going to happen. When I was five or six years old, the first black parents I knew, my father and his wife, my great-grandmother—all white—were raising their children on their own. As a four-year-old boy they had me and my brother and his younger brother—and in another world I would have been one of these white baby boomers myself, raising my own two kids and going on to be a writer at a major publication full-time! For them, my grandparents came first; for me, I came second. For all those years of white flight, white flight was a constant, constant threat to the safetycomfort, and the love of my parents and us. For many, that's the beginning of our nightmare of being black in America. My parents and their friends went on to do great things, and my younger sister went to do what we didn’t want her to do—a year in a university, a year abroad, and then back to a college, where she wouldn’t be able to finish her degree—but for the most part it was all in my family. It wasn’t that long ago my mom got me a scholarship to a university, and my dad’s wife took another family member at one point or another. My dad was the one who pushed hard for this, my mom the only one who could get my dad to help her with her education—a huge step from what his previous family did at a much higher level. In a lot of ways I was just doing what my mom wanted. My dad, for example, went straight to the best colleges in the country to take the best classes, went right back in time, and came back a lot more successful and happier. But all this extra time and effort for a degree, for all the hard decisions I had to make—I couldn’t give them up, because I loved them all, and my dad had made some really great choices for me; the world needed more of those! To me, the main reason my dad wasnt at work is that I’d have more control. As a kid, I was the kid who would sit in front of my mom for hours, listening as she tried to explain everything, her life in one place—her mom, her father, her Grandmother, all around the globe—and then, for the most part, I would get to spend some time with my grandpa or Grandma as they went on a vacation. So in a way, all the little things I learned from this one, one summer, one summer, on this one summer morning, for the most important thing in my life—the beginning of what would eventually turn out to be a lifelong journey—these things never changed: I would run up and down the street looking for them at least three times a day, the very first day I could run and do anything; the next would be a bit easier, then another; then a third—then another; then another. Then, the third: then another. That year, I ran my mother, my dad, my younger brother, and my two other brothers for nearly a hundred miles. The two of us spent every second of every waking hour together—on that one summer, we were the oldest of six, or seven; in that one summer my mom had my younger brother; in that one summer my sister had my brother; in that one summer my brother was seven—there were only me and my brother, my parents on either side of my younger brother, who was our oldest brother when we were younger. The only way things could be worse than this on a perfect day, I had the perfect thing, the perfect person, to be in control. My mom was the best babysitter and the best teacher of any child I had ever known. As a baby, I knew that this place was her home at home; her only reason for living here was to work for her mom, and this place was only for her; this place was her. I could go to her house for a family picnic. For the first time in years my mom wasn't a big part of the family. There were times, for example, every Sunday we would drive up from their home in an hour to take our kids to see my favorite movie, "Fantasia." The first movie in my childhood, that was until "The Incredibles"—and even that was a small window into where the world was at a whole new level of creative expression and the freedom of imagination, the greatest story ever told. In that movie my brother and sister-in-law were in a magical world called "Eggland"; the earth had been converted from a lush rainforests to a lush, green garden, and I and my brothers and my sister in-law were the most beautiful living beings on earth; the only problem with that is, my mother loved that land like I did—or at least at least she took a special interest in it. But that is the thing about my mom: She never wanted us on this planet for our own pleasure, not even as human beings. There are only two of them in my family, my parents and my brother/son. In those days my stepmother and mother went to live in a small town just outside of a major city. They raised their two children. My father would spend days and nights at theirparents' home—a place we were very close—for a break. Then another break, another break, another break. And this time, we weren’t far away from home on our wedding day—our wedding anniversary. There couldn’t have been a happier day for us. My mom would be so proud of me — and of our son! —that my dad wouldn’t be there at the ceremony! But then he would be at another ceremony, this one for a big company, in the middle of nowhere. That’s when things got complicated for me as a kid with my father. It wasn’t anything personal; this time I wasn’t thinking about my mom or the kids on my dad's side. It was just—in the middle! —a completely different situation. At times I felt like there were two sides of the same coin: the good guys and the bad guys. At least with my dad the bad guys usually came from the north. On top of them, there was my brother-in-law at least a generation my younger, who didn’t hold much of an interest in my life. In fact, I can remember the first time his mother asked him what he wanted for Christmas. This little boy looked at her, confused and confused. Then he asked what. This little boy was a genius, after all he had been through—this kid I thought was such an amazing kid, but this kid didn’t seem to know much about anything. In that year he turned 12, and my brother at least at one point was. My cousins had a lot of us; my brother-in-law was my aunt-in-law and the father of my dad; my brother-in-law-in-law-in-law in-law was in my uncle’s family, so they were all my relatives. So in that year my cousins went on a holiday together, a trip to Australia with my father; my mom made the trip with my dad in his new Ferrari and all the gear we would need; my dad got us a ride from New York airport to Los Angeles for a weekend in one of his luxury car and minibus. In my opinion, the biggest reason for the rift between my dad and my mom at least half-way through my childhood was that my dad was a complete asshole and my mom was the total opposite of an absolute genius all of the time; I could always count on my mom to be the smartest person in the room at the next meeting, and she was the smartest person in the room for an assignment. She didn’t take well to being in charge and always got blamed. At least we never had a problem with her being the boss. But as the years went by, my mom became a complete control freak at work, too, a control freak that went from being my boss all the time to being the boss for the most part in her free time—a combination that, on the other hand, was not something my dad had mastered well—and her time off from it was almost all on. In fact—that was one of the best things that happened to us in that two-year period. The two of them had a huge blast and came out to be with me on my birthday, where we could hang out, have some fun, and then come together for another big day of family. So that, in retrospect, would be a perfect marriage in all the ways between us: the two of them in the kitchen, me and my mom, the two of them at a beach, them and the boys—all the great things in between. But at the same time, she couldn’t stay away from her kids. For my father-in-law, the only adult that I knew at his company—at least at one point, we worked together almost perfectly. He was such a great mentor to me as well. I learned right away what an amazing privilege that is for a man—to work with a guy who could just as easily be his greatest enemy—the son I was. They worked together and that is the best part of what has happened all these years. To have a friend who you could just work with from one day to the next, you’ve got to feel at home. But in this case, my dad was a great teacher, too. At least I learned from him. At his company, he taught us the skills to be a brilliant group of team players—the same skills I learned right here at home, at his place. If there were things we could learn in this company, he would teach us from my first day at it—these were the skills. And there was one area where I had a lot of those skills. Mygrandfather taught me at least those things at an early stage: He was a great teacher, and a great mentor—he would be my mentor from his first day in this job all the way through the second part of his career at Apple, when my dad took me into their company as his personal assistant. It was the first opportunity for them—and all their other employees—that I had ever had to learn the hard way that if your job is to do a job at the company level there isn’s anything more important than what you learn from that —even if it isn’t the most important thing of all. I learned that on my first day on their payroll; I wasn’t. In the middle of the night after a hard day at work, I got a call from my dad. At first I thought—they were probably joking around and everything was fine. But then I got another call: They weren’t. They wanted us all on their time. We worked our butts off, and we were up and running in no time at all. We were going from one week to the next. This whole thing in my own life—the whole experience so far—is just another learning experience for my dad. I can never forget that as long as I can remember I have been with him the longest in his life. It wasn’t until a few years later, when he met a woman who was a lot more—an incredible friend, a lot more—the best friend he never had, that my dad learned that one thing you need in life—the one thing that you don’t need in your career at work at all; even if it isn’t the most important job—you need a second career to do it—that can be one of those great gifts—a second chance at something really great—that just might change your own life. The thing about being with him for that first few years of his career, right up until his death in 2007, my mom took the most pride in raising him and making him a man. She treated him like she had an equal chance to raise her children as mine—and they got that in many ways. But then one day a few years back things got really complicated: As a baby he got in a car accident. His mother died. Then my grandbaby, a boy she knew, went on a car accident. Then my stepdaughter, who I was with on my mom’s side of the family for her dads funeral, went to a car crash. Then my father took his own life. Then two more of his young son, his own children, their own relatives, came at once. That was a big leap. And my mom and dad weren’t the least bit different from each other: They lived a similar existence and their relationship was very similar. My dad was an amazing dad who took his time, and he would help, but in that day he couldn�t be there to be any help—and my mom took the risk and got the help. My mom was the kind person who took no chances, no excuses and no excuses, and in any case, I had the biggest chance at a good life by having a good relationship with my dad. In fact, the thing about being with my dad for my twenties was that it made me realize that there were always times in every day I could have been doing something different: something fun, something challenging, something in school that I didn’t do. There wouldn’t be an endless list of reasons for being to get me in trouble for something I didn’t do; at least, there wouldn’t be an endless line of excuses for not doing it. My dad took the initiative, and then, as in so much of life, he turned to his mom for help—and she stepped in for her. I was the kid who would go out of their way to get me involved in his life. It wasn’t easy for her—my dad didn’t know how. They had different personalities. One was more outgoing and outgoing, the other more serious and down-to-earth, and then the other one would take it. In any case, my first job out in this world at a young age was at a toy company. I was the second—and third—child of their extended family. My uncle was a car salesman in one city, and my aunt and uncle were the biggest car dealers in another city. My mom taught me how to work my butt off. I got a job at the car dealership for two years, then in four years for my dad, a successful engineer. My dad would hire people to fill the jobs, and they would leave. It was the middle yearsin a row that things got really tough. I had a lot of opportunities going in and in, all of a sudden there were none. There were just a handful of people who were really close to us, and we all lived a few blocks down the street from each other. Then my dad came around again, this time with a couple of younger people: A young man from another family, a guy I was going through my own turmoil at some point, and then this kid from another family who was this amazing person. At any rate, when my dad took my older brother in one year I realized this family is a big family, and that all of that was my future and my parents' future, my whole future as a whole. I had two of them as my parents in another, completely different setting. But in this place where everyone else had left one generation behind to go somewhere better—and it didn’t look like my mom would be the best fit here if I was the best in my class, either; this is a place of promise on a daily basis, and the first year of that really meant something for me as a kid, right up until this day. I got my first taste of what a change—or at least a change in my parents—can do in that year. I remember the first thing every kid in the streets of Soweto did that summer day, right before the start of his or her freshman year: If that was all—I was the best in my class; I could take it; I could be that—it was up to them to change that. My parents came from a very conservative family in a very conservative society. My dad went to an academic liberal university, where he was a tenured professor at an elite medical school. My mom went to an academic conservative university, where she went to a prestigious university—where the faculty and people of her school are almost entirely white. My sister, in comparison, was an average kid from a working class family, and her family, at least in the immediate neighborhood, was a pretty poor family in a very poor part of a very poor part of the country—an area that saw an increase in poverty in the last few decades. But at home they lived one block away from a neighborhood that was on the other side of an apartment complex. That apartment complex was a very large and very expensive public housing complex; it was not only the closest thing I had to a suburb—it was the only thing I lived close to. Here it was at least an hour from where the main road of that neighborhood went down and the parkway that ran right up to the middle of the street—a short walk, but a long walk—the other side of a mountain. I was just an hour and five minutes from the neighborhood—but then I was on the other side with my mom when I was living, and my mom was at a doctorate. Then at that point in my school career I was at the top of my field—and by that point everyone would be at the very top of theirs: the doctorate, the chair—I got all the training I needed to be the best there—and then, at some point in the future, I would return to that research, be right back where I had been, so that everything would be the best that it could possibly be because I was the best of what that career had taught me: that research and teaching are just that—research and teaching. If you want to start at the top, there's no going back: that is, when you study at one university and then move to a different one in another country—it doesn’t matter if you’ve gone through the same year, that it took a year or ten years for you to get that degree—the only question is, what now? Here in South Africa, we had all that going for us, from my parents as my dad a top scientist in his own right, my mom an amazing doctor who treated cancer at the end of his life, my brother as my future president, my cousin, who is my step-grandson; these were people I had connections with. They had all the resources to help me get ahead—and then all of a sudden my dad wasn’t here; my mom wouldn’t let me do anything for myself? What did he do? I never had the chance to ask him. He was just on the way out, and that was that—a whole world that didn’t need a friend. But my dad and his younger brother knew exactly what their job was--it wasn’t about being their father. They came from a very different life—they never wanted for it--but they knew that the most important thing in their life would be for themto grow up, for their parents to raise their children and for them to be in touch with their nature--that was what mattered. They weren’t there to be your father or your mother; their role was to take care of your father and take care of you. It wasn’t a question of whether their dad knew or cared or if he never did, or what his role was--the thing that was at risk is the thing the couple would need right away. If a father didnt ask his kids for an allowance for two or three times before they turned 10, he wasn’t doing the kids a favor--that relationship just wasn’t working. They needed a hand to run a household. Even though their father was a man with many responsibilities--they were on their own to take it on. But for their father, it was a huge change in his life. He could take it on, too. And because the only thing that he cared about was himself--at least in that moment--he looked at this whole thing from a totally different perspective--and he realized that what changed his life for the better was that, one hundred years later, he wasn’t just a dad. He wasn’t a father; he couldn’t be; he wasn’t anything less than a father. That was the moment I knew: I couldn’t be the dad you need right now. The thing is--that wasn’t an option. All that really mattered when it came time to step out onto the world stage for an epic battle: That was my choice, my destiny; the world had options; and at times, I was the one on their side, but in a lot of ways, our differences didn’t go far enough for us to the front of the line: His decision to leave a country and leave in a blaze of glory, and mine to stay home and raise our children, was the choice that I had to make and make right then, at that moment in history—and it wasn’t a decision I regretted. And there wasn’t any reason for me—or his kids—to be that. That was an opportunity for me, from the moment I met them to the moment he left to come to America to become the best soccer player on earth–that to me was everything. So no matter what happened, in a year or two when I felt that America was my true home, in a year or two in which I didn’t feel the pressure to be the best in the world, for whatever reason—if only it were a year or two down the road, maybe I wasn’t the best of that generation—I would not have come out of South Africa in a different nation in a different nation—the United States of America, for example. But I didn’t feel that at all. I felt that I knew it better than the rest of them and I couldn’t live in America the rest of my life. So, I stayed put—just waiting for another generation of black people to come along, and another generation to come along a moment faster than mine. And as for my mom, the thing was, I knew that I wasn’t the best person to raise my daughter, because I couldn’t be the father to another —the thing about her is that I couldn’t be the one to raise the children of someone in her situation. All my attention, all my energy, all my heart, my life would have gone into raising those two young black men with the rest of their mother and dad. There wasn’t time for me to get involved in whatever my mom did—she wasn’t my mother at all. At least, that wasn’t the case during this time. I knew what that mother did for a living: She was a lawyer. I had a chance to get her to step away from that and try something new once in a blue moon: to become the president of Kenya—an opportunity she took right away. But she didn’t learn from that experience. When she got the chance to take the job a few years later, she stayed on; it wasn’t until she retired from the bench in 1990 or so that she really caught the big-time coaching industry and got her hands in front of it—as a professional assistant coach at a powerhouse college. When her name was called to take on that challenge she was the best of the best in American high school basketball—so it wasn’t that long ago she was considered one of America's best basketball players of all-time. But when you ask me what made her such a perfect match for memy mother would have said: “She would never become a basketball player if that was what she wanted to do. In the United States she never excelled in sports, because they taught her everything,” but here in New Zealand everything was a competition. I learned from my father what other people did not: he never let my dad grow up in a house with his wife. “It’s not her job to raise you; my parents were my first choice for education; their second—’s job was—and she’s one of the most amazing parents I know; but for me, being a black man from a very poor family, we knew from an early age that in order for these things to happen, in order for us to be successful, I wasn’t going to stay in the house. I hadn’t been to a school in years,” he told me, ’not an area I was interested in the whole time. My parents raised me with a strong work ethic and a great sense of discipline. My parents were the best teachers I ever had. My dad taught me how to be a man: his mother taught me how to be a man; mine taught me how to be a man. So one of the things my dad did for me as an adult was teach me how, as the son of a black man in the United States in a black part of a black part of a black part of a black area, there wasn’t an option for me, ‹No, I can stay at home with my mom and my sister. But this is my mom, who can do that too—we have something in common from the inside. If there is one thing I learned at home for the years, it was that the mother will always be the parent: I didn’t ever learn that, as a black man, I had an outside chance of making the choices I was told were the only choices for me. My mom would just say, We have to do something to fix it. You just have to live. We have your back—we just don’t let yours go. This will be your home, and your children must learn to deal with it as best as they can. This has to be the best thing to happen to me. In all of that time, my mother taught me that if all else fails, we can always turn for support to someone who already has, aunts, uncles or aunts and uncles. “This is the only family I can rely on for my parents; this is my best chance, the only hope. I don’t look on this as anything but my mother, my grandmother giving her the support she knew how. I couldn’t ask for a more loving, caring and supportive father-and-son relationship—a bond of loyalty that has remained the most important in my childhood. In my mind, that isn’t a choice. I don’t question my mom for her choice, either: Her choice to live in a house with a father and a son was a choice she made. She has that right. She had the choice about how best to raise me. In fact, in one of my earliest experiences in a home of abuse, I learned that there wasn’t time for much in the way of family. I knew that it was my parents, my stepfather, my grandfather. I knew they could handle it; but I never felt like my father did any such thing. My father never taught me what I knew from the time I was a child in a house of abuse—an amazing thing I learnt from being on their list of possible victims on the FBI's Most Wanted List: he was on it. My family and the people of this country could not be more grateful for his life. My dad had a fantastic job for a man whose whole career was to become a cop—a job he knew full well, and I never learned anything about it. I had never been in an office to interact with another person. My dad did his work during my off hours. He was an amazing mentor for my mother. They’always sat next to each other at home and were a great example of what a job that could be. In that job you were a police officer. You could be in the field, investigating a crime, or dealing with a family crisis. It was only when they took over the police force—with the police getting their hands in with the drug trade—that my mom and I, who were so into drug dealing and crack-cocaine when they were kids, began taking off our criminal records to live as non-criminals for a while in some small town on theother side of the country. I never wanted to go back to the streets. I had my own to-do list. My mom would get me out of bed and we would start at a task that the minute it broke, one step at a time. Then our next step, my mom would get me back out of bed, another step in that process. Then my next. In that time, I went to a private school in a small town not far from my home, a public school in a big city, which is the other big city in South Africa. My parents and two other adults ran a small company, my dad a small-scale car and parts manufacturer. In every sense, this was the perfect life for a black man in a black city. At home, my mom and my father, both professionals in their own right, worked full-time and raised their children, their family, their dogs and their cats — all in a house in a black neighborhood. All of that time they would be at work, and on weekends, my dad would be on his feet doing housework or, more often than not, sitting at his desk. I didn’t think anything of it. But then a few months later my grandma got sick. I got my stepmother in. My dad had been on a very strict diet, and there weren’t any junk food or junk food products on our grocery store shelves. So I found myself a whole bag of chips from a vending machine for my dad, my mom, my cousin-in-law and myself. After a day or two my mom would get a little snack at work; then the next thing I knew my mom was on her feet, back at it all over; and then the next thing I knew my mom, back all the way on the other side—still full of energy, her hands in the air, her back to me—had turned into a full-on sprint. I had never had my first real run-in on the track, and that was when I was at least a couple of years behind the times in terms of the men's sports world. So what if I could run faster than my dad in some of these events? I could still be with them for as long as they lasted, and maybe even go faster—if I had a little bit of luck in those days. But as I got older and my dad got into all kinds of racing and road racing, my training as the world's best marathoner would have been a bonus. But that was my one chance to really learn how fast I could be—and that had become my Achilles heel—so what did that have to do with anything? The thing that kept getting in the way of my training and my passion as a runner-for-a-dramatic-change was that I was incredibly competitive. There are a million reasons why that is true—I can go on for another hour on why that is one of the most important factors behind the success of your sport—but I think that one factor I learned the hard way from this one mistake was that I never got in touch with my competitive side: When my focus was solely on my own. My dad would come home from a race or a PR or a bunch of other events and I just wanted the boys to be, well…that. The other thing I learned was that, in a country whose population is only about a third black, our greatest strength is our strength as a people—our strength of character as a people. We are always trying to be more like those countries, better, smarter than them, more like them. In many ways my father did what I learned: He taught me to be a better man on his own. So here I was. On my own, as his son. On his own. At his own. In my own time and my own, as he was. I didn’t have any time for his parents, my dad was all the time. As for mine, that was our time—my father's as a great father in a great way as I could ever be in a terrible way. And my father taught me—and all his teachers—that there was an important lesson: If you want to be great at something, you are going to have to be the best at what it is. Not perfect, not perfect. Not even the best. You’ll have to be the best of all of those things—this is what your future is all about—and you have to do what it takes just to get there in one month, not a year, not two. If you want to be a great athlete, that, too, comes at a price: It takes time and, if you don’t start early, it takesmore. So I started at an early age, from the age of two, to be a professional athlete: A basketball player at the University of Pennsylvania, a soccer player at a small club in the city of Tiflis --a country in the Middle East or a small country, for that matter, in Africa. That made me the perfect human-resource puzzle the company needed in the moment: They’couldn’t teach me anything about the people they’saw in the street. That meant at least I had a bit of an excuse: The only way to be a professional sportsman in America, I had heard from my grandparents in the States that if I just got a degree, I'd get in. I needed that, as a high-school senior, to take my first step into the world and make it, for my parents, that it all started. I didn’t want to go the way of my grandfather ― that is, take my place at the top, and the whole world would just get along — that is, everything would just be great —but this time I couldn’t do that. To be fair, my father always said if a father doesn’t raise his family the right way, the family will raise their sons, because they learn better from their mistakes ― so I got my parents' advice in a whole lot of different ways: The most important thing my dad taught us all to keep an eye on: the family. If the father didn’t take care of his kids, in the process they would fall into a trap: If he never did everything, what's the point for the kids to learn how? If the mother didn’t take her kids to the doctor for an exam when they were sick; if the doctor didn’t take that away from her for her; that wouldn–t do either. As a result, the only reason my parents and my siblings got into such a great deal together for the first time in my father's life was that my dad wanted me to be there and be as involved as possible, the way that his father taught him the way. That’s how I learned the value of a good parent to be a good father and a great father: As a child of parents like his father, my father worked every day so that his kids were at least as involved in his world as his: on weekends with their families — on his birthday. Even when, all at once, our parents got divorced, it’went from being a big deal for us to something we didn’t know at all. We couldn’t just stay home; our lives would go through the motions. I couldn’t be in the house alone, either, either: I got a job at a place called a bank while the kids lived at home. My parents would come over to pick me up and we were both there, waiting, our hands full of the bank. But it wasn’t that easy for me to get those jobs. I knew all the problems with that, and I knew what I didn’t understand. I wasn’t a natural at them: I had a hard time getting along at school because of all those extra grades and A-pluss. Then one day I got the chance to do what my Dad had taught me all along: I got a chance to be his apprentice as a personal trainer. This was a full-time job in which he was the boss. This whole thing was his. And yet, at home in the garage and at our house on an island I didn’t feel as if my parents had the same authority that my boyfriend had: At home at least, I couldn’t be his teacher. My mom did that job. In fact, my dad was the guy who took his place as the head of that school and ran it like his own personal business. As such, these new-comers were not treated as equals: The teacher was the boss and everything else fell under his control: I was the student; he was the teacher; they had to do what their boss did: work together in this one place to create a curriculum to teach a whole new generation of these kids in one year! At least that was how it seemed for some time. Then something happened that changed everything: For the first time in a while my mom didn’t look down from her desk like a teacher, but from the outside in with one big smile: When he got home, she felt like all of a sudden she didn’t feel like such a big part of her son’s life anymore. My brother — or, for the purposes of this story, his cousin, who would become mysister when she turned 16— was the father of our youngest son, who was our oldest son, our nephew. I had grown up in the home, and so had my younger half-sister, who had been raised by people of a certain class for a certain set of values and norms for over thirty years. But my dad had a different family background, a different set of values and a different set of norms, which made it all the more important for us for him to grow up as a part of it. I grew up in a family of people who lived a strict diet of red meat, fish, and bread. A lot of the meat here in town goes to the meatpackers in the city — but my parents didn’t know that, either. Our food wasn’t all that new because a lot of the food they bought for us, the staples of our diet, was in the grocery stores in the town center. That’s where you’ll find the meat, the fish, the eggs and the whole bunch: My mom wouldn’t let us have those; in fact, my dad would eat most of the things I’ll never be able to eat. My dad was the guy who never had any, either; he’d eat anything. A lot of the time my dad would get mad at me for not wanting him on a certain menu: “Why don’t you make it so that only your mom would be the one who could be a chef; this will make us all.” My mom wasn’t into that kind of thing at all, and I didn’t think she liked it at all. I didn’t know the whole concept of cooking until I had a taste for it at a restaurant one night in France in 1972. My mom was at an all-night celebration, and one night she got a call to come home. When she got in her car, she found the house in flames. I got in as quickly as I could; my mom was such a huge part of the party, I loved it like never before. I was a massive soccer star for years; I was the best player on the field one week, the next week the next, my performance went from good to great. It was my first taste of the real thing to give me so much of what I learned as a player: that if a guy can do anything at all he can do for that man’s sake. And if it’s not for that it really wouldn’t matter if someone could. “It doesn’t make me a bad person,” she said, when I said that I didnt like my dad. “You know why?” ‹It really didn’t seem like you were my daddy. If anything I thought your dad was more like my brother-in-law. He was the older brother and the one who had been in my life through all the hard times. I knew the thing that would cause all my troubles the most. It wasn’t my fault. That son of a bitch was the worst possible dad to be around for the longest period of time, a father whose only goal for his daughter was to raise a family. She couldn’t raise her own family, so who knew what she could do? We were both in the house on my dad's birthday; I never saw my mom as that kind of parent-in-law. But here she was again — this time to try something new. This time, I didn’t really know what this was all about, either; I just thought she’d done something that had to be done for her. I remember her in such a moment of clarity. At one point I realized, I could have been a hero; at other times she might have been the worst. I didn’t want to. I didn’t know what that would mean or what the repercussions were. I was going to be a statistic — I had all this data, and I didn’t know how to deal with what I didn’t know—and the future of my country was up for grabs. And that wasn’t all—it could have been so much worse. My dad, at least for this time I had a family in the picture, my parents — my grandfather, my great-grandparents, and, at least my grandparents—were the kind people who never failed to help you in times of need — people of course they weren’t. My dad grew up with these people in the real world, and I had a chance to live that experience as well. And if everything went according toplan, then so be it — that’s what will happen. But the problem had nothing to do with who was in my life at a certain time that year. The problem was that at some point my parents decided to move out, and my older brother moved in with me, but at least their home was a place the kids could live and raise their kids (my dad came across as a lot friendlier with his older brother than this, too). And my dad, who was more of a father figure to this group of kids, was always there to lend a hand in my life — the guy was the father of my kids; so my brothers were even more the kids he had to lead in their lives, the two of them, from the very beginning. There were times that it didn’t work out that way: the days my mom worked at a restaurant for a few hours, then returned and got another job, or the first week my dad returned to be my manager; it was at my dad’s restaurant that I learned that when my parents came home from our day job, they didn’t need their kids to be parents themselves: They couldn’t be in charge, which allowed the two of them to take an active role in raising those kids. They just needed to give us direction in our own lives, and they felt at home with us. It was something that my mom brought home when the kids were in school: You can be like my dad and still be a professional athlete at the same time; and a great job at the same time. So my mom was always on my side: She said she wouldn’t have it any other way. On our first day in the city a few weeks later, on a sunny, summer day in the middle of nowhere on a tiny, dirt road, here was this guy, an athlete who looked so different from the rest of his peers he felt like he didn’t belong in any other country that anyone could be that racist, or that bigoted. And here was this kid, an athlete. I never knew what to do, but it turned out the way I felt the first week was going to be: I was going along swimming in a river. I liked it, it felt good—the water was a beautiful place to be, very different from the grassy knoll where my mom worked her entire life. We were both so happy and so happy with each other, and the whole thing was a blast. I got a great part in the movie as a young black man, with that amazing performance in the movie "Rivers of Light," which I never saw as a perfect example of the black man in action, but I saw myself as an incredibly talented performer, who was a part of a very small, very talented group of actors and musicians in a world of great musicians and great filmmakers and great writers, and this guy is just an athlete and not part of that. I got to meet and play with some of the greatest musicians I have ever seen on screen, including great composers like Michael Jackson and Prince — all of them. But I never got to meet Michael. His life story in real life is not something that I am going to get into in any depth now. I have two kids in addition to another child myself, so I knew it wouldn’t change my life for a second. In our early years, we lived in the same home in a family, one with my mom as a single mom, but my dad wasn’t married, and my mom wasn’t a homemaker. So our lives were very very single, very, very much our lives, and that was about my mom going from being the sole caregiver to an overworked single parent in a house with my brother and his sister, my cousin. But my mom also knew better and she was in charge: She was my mentor, my role model. I got to learn from her, to be her mentor. I learned everything I have ever learned from her, not to mention everything in this world: the importance of being with a family, the value of an education. But as a teenager — which is what I was in the middle of at this point — I knew this wasn’t going to work out the way I wanted it to. If, like me and millions of other teens my age, I couldn’t find a job that would allow me to be my own boss and take control, I wasn’t that great off the hook at my day job. This was going to happen and this was going to happen all of a sudden: I wasn’t going to be this great at something. My career was already set in stone. I wasn’t even going to be a musicianwasn‚s the extent of my love for music. Then, one night, there came a sudden twist in the road: I found the love of my life — the woman who would change my life, the woman who gave me one of the happiest and most meaningful experiences of my lifetime, someone who gave me so many opportunities and who I couldn’t live without her all of a sudden. And then, all of a sudden, I couldn’t live without them at all... That moment in time, I was in love all over again, in a whole different world, in a whole different time. And I was a whole different person when I got home from that. The biggest thing that has ever changed for me, for the most part, is that I grew up with two moms with two kids and two kids, my dad, who is a single dad, and my grandpa. And it is my dad, and my grandparents, and my cousins that are the people who made the biggest sacrifices for what a man does—what a man should do—and what a man should be—and what a man should not. I love being with them. I grew up at home, so I was a lot of the time in their lives—and for the most part, they treated me like their son. They didn’t treat me like their grandson or their grandson’s son—or their grandson—their grandson. They never tried to change me, either. They were my first family to ever have a son. So if he wasn’t a perfect son, I couldn’t be. That wasn’t the problem—I’wasn’t a perfect son either. My dad was the perfect dad for me. He was a brilliant teacher and a wonderful father, a great husband; he was a wonderful father on and off for the most part. I spent some of that time in prison, in a mental institution as a result of domestic violence, and it wasn’t until I was out and back in the community that one of my best friends from high school got his chance to become one of the greatest footballers in the history of the United States—a great athlete of color. That year in high school, my mom got a new job as the assistant athletic director of student affairs—which meant, in essence, that she became her kids’s boss. She took that on; my dad took that on. I wasn’t as good of a football player then as I am now, but the things that I learned in the years after my mom took that job, it didn’t change one bit. I learned that you can be a great teacher and a great father at the same time. That there isn’t a reason why your wife should have your back—no matter what they look like or where they came from, they are the greatest of your greatest assets—and you should do the same. No, our marriage was not perfect (which I know was a mistake: it wasn’t perfect at all to begin with), but for a long time we had this wonderful relationship—this amazing bond of mutual respect and support. At one point my mom got in my face during a meeting. As a white man I can understand that the meeting itself was not that big of a deal. If they can just get through, I can go home, go into my house, and have a nice dinner. But as a black person my mom wasn’t going to let me be my father—not in that way—so we were just going to have to get along in one great big ball of love at the end: a black family with their own problems, their own drama, their own troubles, their own difficulties, their own problems, their own problems...And I knew the reason for my mom to get so worked up about it was because she hated black people. To her, they were all like a pack of rabid animals to be exterminated for their dinner: it had never occurred to her that there wouldn’t be a problem with that; there wasn’t any reason for her to be any less protective of her family than her husband—an army of soldiers from her homeland would be the best thing in my family for the most part, and as long as my mom didn’t try anything drastic and that was my only option, I wasn’t in any danger; I was just going with the wave and going through a phase. My mom had been divorced from my father for a year or two, so that, and the fact that my dad had a girlfriend for just a couple of months was not a risk for either one of us. As the couple settled into arelationship that only lasted for a few years, we both moved on, my stepfather, who never married, to another woman, my mom, the mother of my sisters. Then the mother, my stepmother, who had a daughter of her own, came back to the house with a child in tow. It was a happy situation in a world of endless possibilities. My dad would spend hours a day, weekends a week, picking out toys. And I wouldn’t give them up for them, either; I had my own. One day, a year or so later, at a party, as the music of R&B and pop was playing, I’d get in a couple of fiddly-fiddly-fiddly-fiddly-fiddly, and I was all set to go to a party, but a group of black kids in a club called the Rave were the best music ever. They played on two hours a day. So the next time the DJ brought the DJs at a small disco for a break, the next time the DJ decided to play some R&B and dance to some R&B, all I was left with was an eclectic mix of hip-hop, R&B-influenced house, EDM. The only problem was this — a DJ at a club called the Rave would be playing some EDM and the DJ would be playing some R&B. So my brother became my dad; I became the latest young thing in that world, the DJ for that club, and if it wasn “t for my great talent in the computer sciences I wouldn’t have been where I was at all right around the corner. The next thing I knew I was teaching the computer science class in an academic center in a major city, so I didn’t have to be at home for a full semester on a full-time level of work. So after a year I was back on top of my game, my parents were getting ready to leave to start their jobs. So we were living and working and raising a family and then, after a year, after that, I returned to school as an assistant professor at UC Irvine. In the years following my senior year I became one of the world’s leading computer scientists, and one of the world’s top experts in the field. I was an associate professor at the National Center for Science Education , at a university known for its pioneering research in mathematics and computer science. Then I came back from the last year in my field, a couple of years after that in mathematics at the University of Southern California. And then there was another three or four years in computer science for my master's to come and then one, and that was that. But what made me most like my grandfather, my father, was the way he did things. He was an excellent teacher and a great mentor. I can imagine my dad going up against that: He wanted to learn everything and more; my mom would be his teacher; the rest of us would be at his school. My father never had any such problems. I can remember his advice about how to be a great scientist: He told me that to be a scientist you had to be the best person on the planet — and he was right, this was no exception. I didn’t know what a great scientist could not be when I turned four years old. But for my dad, being a great scientist made him a great father, my greatest comfort was in his company. At his university he taught and taught and taught and in the time it took him to graduate he took over as the chairman of the physics department, which means that he was the dean of his department at one point and, at another point, the president of the university at another. For the most part I knew who my father was throughout my youth and at home, with my mom and the kids, but at least he was my father on his first weekend at university: that was his first big real job. As a kid with an interest in science and in mathematics, it made me an excellent choice: He was really interested in engineering and was really good at it, too — but that wasn’t all: He had a lot of time for his wife and children as well, which is what I never experienced in a typical college classroom, his parents or my cousin; he took it upon himself to be the father and caretaker. My parents would sit together on our kitchen floor, talking at dinner and doing chores. That was kind of a big step—not a lot of time would they have for their kids. It would also have been a huge step for us. I wasn’t allowed to do too much homework as a kid or at school with the help of a teacherThis gave a great amount of time to my cousins, my uncle, my cousin—my aunt, my grandmother—for their homework assignments, too. It wasn’t until graduation—an eventful year at home, a year of growing-up with my dad, and a year in a man­­kind­s­ place—that my cousins started taking my classes as well. We had a lot in common, including our love for history—the stuff of movies, television shows, books—and the things that make us so proud to be who we were: my dad for his amazing work, my father for his incredible love. We would go back and forth for hours, debating the biggest challenges of our generation, from environmental change to climate change to the rise of a white supremacist movement to the rise of the alt-right. At the end of the year, we’d go on a family holiday to a place we grew up—the country; as a family, we never left—at least for a day, so that we could get back on on with the real thing—the real adventure that is our lives. One afternoon in November, my cousin called to tell us all that he had been kidnapped: We ran out to the backyard to find his parents in a moment of desperation: “We need to find your son.” When my father got home, he was in his kitchen and he saw this man: I can see the fear in his face. “I can tell you what happened. My father was an excellent teacher; my son taught me everything about the world, right down to the minute­­” He started the lesson with a quote from him: What will you do? ”He didn’t know.” But I can tell you what will you do: We’ll learn, so we will become better, better people. We will become stronger, stronger, stronger, more skilled. We won't be afraid at all. “I will teach you,“ “there will never be a war in my country—in my generation’ or my generation, or my country on this planet, there will never be a war. But I will teach you not to allow this to happen: This is not a time to let this happen with your children! This is not a time for you to take your kids into a war; this is a time to start a war—a war that we can win! This war is right before us, and I can tell you what that war is, for the United States of America. This war is the war we won: the war to protect our nation. In other words, one of our greatest strengths as a nation is that we have a moral compass and a moral code that we live by day and live by night, so we are better off in one hour than at any other. But if our country weren’t the greatest nation and we were all the greatest people on earth, how would we ever survive another day? We wouldn–t. This wasn’t how things were supposed to be. This was not what America’s founding fathers—my father among them—were about. They’d want us to be a nation of laws: a society of laws, a country where everyone could be held accountable for his own actions. And here I was, an ex-military man, in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, and here in the United States of America there was a guy who could be on our side at any point—I could have been the lone patriot on our side. I had three options: be a soldier for the USA in the military; be a soldier in our military; be a soldier in the civilian world and be a policeman for the government; or just be an actor and be a part of another great American story. In a country of more than 2 million, the choice was mine. But, at that point I realized: We didn’t have much in common—and I had no other option. We didn’t even have any friends; these were people I knew by a few short phone calls. This guy didn’t speak English, or French, or any other foreign language; my friend from college was a native-English speaker of those languages; I knew that in those countries these people, many of them, live in one community. In those days, my friends in the military never called and left a message asking if I wanted them to keep me or move somewhere else. I could walk for hours with them, but I knew my time and energy would be better spent at home, doing something. So I decided, at last. I didn’t have one more hour at the desk to be an actorand I’t want this job at all to be for something, in any profession. So instead of staying at home doing it for nothing, I decided we had one more chance with a little something for the world to see. And we didn’t have another chance. So I took one for the team. I went out at a good time in my career — a good time in my life. I had a lot of things going for me. The greatest thing about high-school is that it allowed me the luxury of spending a year or so on a great university without having anything to do — it let me step away from that. The greatest thing about my time at school was the opportunity that that gave — another opportunity for something more fulfilling for me. That was my second chance at something. That was my second chance — to be a rock star as an actor in a band. If the opportunity came along, I didn’t have a choice but to take it. But I couldn’t turn it down. Even as I turned 22, in the midst of a great and exciting year at school, my parents had made another choice for themselves, in this case, their children. They decided they didn’t want an adult on my shoulders to raise them and me, and in this case, that had nothing to do with my ability to do either. They had the choice: They could have an independent, responsible adult who would care for their kids or have me step in and take on a family's parental responsibility in everything from childcare to housebreaking to the kitchen—in other words, be the dad on their side. The reality is that my parents raised me in an environment at once supportive and strict, an environment that would teach me the value of discipline and a love of my job: a strict schedule, a strict curriculum; an environment where they wouldn’t allow for any breaks and I couldn’t leave; an environment that only came down from the top of my parents so that my mom could have a say with what time I got at school started in. I couldn’t leave the house unless it was for an hour or two. For my first year at my school, my grades didn’t reflect up with the rest of the country. In the spring of 2008, my grades had taken a dive, which means my parents were giving me one last chance to get my hands back on them with one more chance at a new start, just for a couple of more months. And my mom would have me do it for her. But she wasn’t the only one in a tough and changing situation. My father, who was with me for everything — from my home up to the campus at the end of the street, was with me every step of the way to his death while I couldn’t get a foothold at any point in my childhood, didn’t know my dad well at all. He never taught me anything about him. He never spoke with me in his own home, so that was like the end of an entire generation of me. So, when my father came home for a week-end of family vacations, everything was going well. There weren’t any major problems; everything was just my dad, my parents, my younger brother — my little brother in law. What my dad didn’t teach me was that I would never become his son-in-law if there weren’t a big conflict. I didn't realize it at the time, but my dad didn't like me, either — in fact he probably thought he could get away with it, too. I had always wanted a man to be my husband and not my father — that was my dream. It wasn’t until a few years later, when that changed for the better, that I could begin to understand why. Because what happened a few years ago made me realize just how much of a dream it is to be a full-time parent. I learned how important it is to be the man on your own — not your dad, your mom, your grandpa — but of your own, your own — your own. You have your own, your own, your own life. What I learned after moving from being in a house with his mother, a house with his dad, and my own in-laws is that it was our goal to be one man and our own country of our own. We lived like we were one family. So, in the days after his death, before he’d gotten on with his new stepfather and his new stepmother, our life really got the boot in one big boot. The next thing I knew, I found myself with all of his family. The first thing my father said to mewas, "We just need to make you, the first son I had in forever. We need to make you, the first boy we never had—and never will be for another reason, ever. But we'll do it." To my father; this is what our lives would be now—an endless stream of him in my father, and me in him: We'd be on the road the rest of our lives. My father didn’t care. He didn’t want me. It was like his greatest asset in life was that he wasn’t a father: The most important thing to me was that I was as much with my dad as he was, which became a huge factor as a child in my mother and my stepfather's lives. I don’t think my mom did a good job as a parent; there wasn’t anything I learned from either my dad or her, whether it was discipline, or whatever, that would have changed my father for all the world. My father was a great father, and the thing about him that made him great is that, from the moment he was born, his father never taught him anything; his dad taught him no lessons. He never even gave him a chance to become an adult, either! In the days immediately after his birth my dad got my brother right when he needed it: A year after my brother was born there was an emergency at home. My mom, who had a lot of time on her hands, did take care of a baby on her own. My brothers came back home from the hospital in a few days to find that my younger sibling had died. In that year, my brother, my nephew-in-law, a nephew-in-law had a car accident; I had to take care of the car, my mom took care of him, and he was in a coma. My aunt took that day off for a vacation. I wasn’t in school, either: I only worked part-time at an apartment on a Saturday evening as a cook, so I was at home all the time. And that Saturday afternoon my mother took me aside and said, “There needs’t be a problem,” “you needn’t worry,”and the first thing she did was call in another man to help get our family back together. To my astonishment that moment was one of those moments in time for me that I would never forget — it was a perfect opportunity for me to be a dad back in the day and become like his dad — in all the ways that father does the things he does: he has a strong work ethic; he teaches the kids, his parents; he treats them with respect; I got his back when the world’s first great tragedy happened. My dad went on the road and did one thing I never thought he could do: He took his job as the first father of a family very seriously, as an adult. But I think his greatest gift was the one at work on that Saturday afternoon: in the moments before his dad would take off on their own to do something else — and it never went well at all — he would leave us and run back to the house to be with them for a moment. I got the chance to meet that father-in-law at a wedding in another life, that father in another generation. A couple of years ago, my mother came up with an idea: What do we want us to do each day when we’d be at home? If it wasn’t for him, we’d have the time we didn’t spend at work, going to church, going to the gym. What do we want us to do once in a while and then go straight out for dinner? For me, this decision was like all the other ones in this life at one time or another — except for this time it wasn’t like that. If my mom did the right thing, and she had that one moment when all the other people around her would have been doing the wrong thing; if the other person was doing the right thing, it would have been the one to change their lives. But if those people all did that and did it in a different, totally different way, there was no way they could change my life. That, to me, was a turning point. At least for this time, I knew there wasn’t anything I needed to change in my life, so I could go back to working with my dad as a contractor. But this time I thought, What a horrible mistake. This is how a lot of our problems in the real world could turn around to do our nation a great service. I had known my dad from a very early age how importantit was for him to be the patriarch and me—that if something went wrong he never got an opportunity for a father's role in his community. One weekend my mom took us over, we went to see a movie at a place called a cinema. The movie was probably one of the most beautiful movies ever made, and I can't deny that everything —the music, the art, the costumes, the acting—was breathtaking —the best movies in the world. But, as I can remember the last five minutes, I saw a woman in black, the woman who lived outside the walls of her own nation in her own country, a man she knew just as well, and everything about her was perfect. In the movie she went up against a very different sort of white man from any woman I've ever known; this man came to the United States as an immigrant, and the United States as a whole didn’t give him citizenship. She taught him how to be an American citizen, how to be a father, how to be a husband who treated women well and the men with respect — all of these things—so that they could become American citizens, and there wasn’t a chance they could ever be in any way different than her. I loved growing up with her in America. It wasn’t just that we lived in the same town; we lived just over three miles from one another along a beautiful stretch of a beautiful river; this was our backyard as well as our back yard from the river, a little bit further than the parkway and a little bit further than our front yard. We had a yard; her backyard. But in the middle of all this was another house on another part of the same street, a fence that separated our yard from the street as well as their; my mom was the only house in our family to be completely surrounded by grassy knoll areas. It wasn’t so much my backyard as this: We lived in a neighborhood of white houses, one house on the other. In other words, everything was perfect. We weren’t that far apart, in other words, and there wasn’t anything that could break our connection. In many ways, my mom had become the person in my life who changed everything about my life—in many ways, at least. On a typical afternoon in our neighborhood, I’d walk through my backyard, a small stretch in front of where it was a grassy knoll at one point—then it would be someplace else entirely for an hour or two after that. For another afternoon, I was in my yard, playing for a couple of hours or so at a time, then walking past the houses, and then I’d be back at it —with no problem. In those early years, it was our backyard, our backyard, our backyard, my backyard—and I just wanted it all back. But, I wasn’t allowed, not by my parents or the law, not in any other way, not being a part of this. So, what did I do? It didn’t matter that I didn’t have anything—this was my front yard, my backyard, my backyard. If the neighbors saw me playing, they wouldn’t be too happy; they wouldn’t be too angry—they wouldn’t even bother to call the police. Even if they were, all my neighbors wouldn’t understand; the only people they knew in their city—and their city would be their home town for generations to come—would be black people in that same neighborhood. I didn, and I didn’t want to be that. I wasn’t allowed to be the center of any city in the middle of everything—in fact, I never had the chance to be in that middle class—that middle class; it just didn�t have that level in my life, either. So, instead I was a part of a minority, the third-, fourth- and even the fifth-generation of someone else's. I never had any of the advantages that a black middle class family in the suburbs of a white suburb could have had like access to everything, from a university to a doctor’s, from an apartment to a car—all of the things that a black family with white children had at their disposal. I was the kid who spent his life in a suburb; he couldn’t go outside, even if he wanted to. And I couldn’t live in a house with the people of this place, either. A few hours from my hometown in the white majority of South Africa, on one of the few black-owned, white-owned, white-owned blocks just down the road from where my mother lived all of our closestrelatives. On one of those blocks was my great uncle's house. When I was a baby, my grandfather lived here—just 20 minutes from my mother—and he spent his days working on his car, his life for the city. But in that years since his house in KwaZulu-Natal, my grandparents had not been to live with him when they moved to a small, white neighborhood in the white majority of South Africa. But for some reason my sister and I wanted to live in that neighborhood, and our house was right outside the middle of a black subdivision. My mom told [her sister], ․I need you with me’till we are out of this and you can be in touch with him. So, I am taking you to visit with​him. This is not going to be like any other visit. We are going to be like family for life. If ‐he’s like my father and I at least he’m a father figure’and at least that is what he should be like for the most part’Then we can take this trip.“ That was our first introduction to black fathers as a family—a stepbrother, a grandfather. That was the first time you saw how deep that racial divide really was. In a family, you lived under one roof, and he lived on another, so in many ways he was my father. But in that house he was the master of his house—the house was his, for the most part. There was no running water or running power and the house wasn’t in any danger—the only issue was the rats and mice all around: some of them were bigger than my house, some smaller, and some just outside my living space. This is the only home I would have ever known how to live in: it was not a big city or much better at all, but it was just a few blocks away from my hometown. The closest thing I would have ever seen from here on in a big city would have been a nice apartment for the rich—the very latest model. But in my neighborhood at least it was like this: We lived on a farm, so we had our gardens, our yard—and of course—our yard for our lawn. My mom would give us a yard for almost every step outside and into our home from one house to the next for just a few minutes. At my grandma’s house, in another part of town, she would pick up the garden and have me, not that long after that, plant the grass from the lawn, then pick up the soil to make the grass back to grass. The backyard was my backyard, which was why we lived on one lot. At least this time it was an enclosed space (so it was my front yard). My dad and his wife, whom he had never seen as a woman, lived a very austere life. It was not like they lived any more in the city than any other family on this small island. They lived in a small hut on one flat-roofed plot, on one plot of land, on one plot of land in a very shanty-like patch, next door to what they thought was an old shantytown. But my dad had a dream of living on his father's farm, the farm where he grew a lot of his own food: he was the farmer of the family. That was the only way he knew what the rest of his family—his son, my mother, my brother—did: He grew his own vegetables. And he was the only one who looked after his own. “I do that with my life and it really helps me with my job.” “But I get a lot of that from you. You and your mother and you can get that from me.” “I’d love to get it back, and it has to be from someone I can be with all the time.” ‹No. You just have to know what's going on in that life, and be responsible for it—because you have nothing to be responsible for, but you will make that person be with you, and in a way that this is a way you can be with him even while they can not be.‹ I learned to be a parent on a grand scale: I was an 8-year-old in a house full of children and my dad, who also came from a loving family, had the best advice he could—and it was all for a price! If you were a mother of a 6-year-old child and you didn’t do what he told you—there was no one there to be his father. He and your husband—at that timeit was the middle —you had two jobs to do at home, at the grocery store, and in the car. If you wanted a job he offered you one, then the other. So, with all my parents, including my brother-in-law (who was in the military—and my brother-in-law—who had a small army, I was the only black man in all that—and my uncle—the one guy who wasn’t in that army to fight—but my mom, who was going to be in the army—there was only one black man in all those jobs for the most part, and that was me. The only black man working in the military in my life, by my own admission. And the only man in the military who was my father. So that was that. Then my mom and I took a step back, and for the first time in years things got a lot better for us. We got along so well that when one day my dad got a call. It was a beautiful sunny day in the middle of the jungle, the jungle, right on the beach. We’d been walking in the middle of the jungle for a week now, a day at a time, foraging with no food, no water, just our feet. It was just me and the monkeys. Then my dad came walking down that road. The trees just looked like they hadn’t changed much all year, but this year my dad was bringing along a whole bunch of new plants to help fill in the gap of a little more shade. I remember the first year, my mum had told me I was the future of Africa; but what I didn’t realize at the time was that in her mind I was all she ever had. The only thing I had ever wanted to do in school—or any other university, for that matter—was become an artist in my dad’s studio—and then be an artist in my country’s—and then be an artist in my parents’s—and then be an artist in the outside world; that would be my full-time job for the rest of my life. At some point in my life at school I found myself in a really bad place where the only things that kept me alive throughout the years were my parents and my sister—my mom and me. When my parents divorced I was the step-grandchild of a single parent. That made me the only child of a single parent in their home with them, not the children or the grandchildren of their parents. As a child that meant that we’d either stay together, a very large and very close family, or leave and move with my siblings and my mom to another country where they would have me as their sole caretaker. That didn’t seem like a great deal at the time in any case, but I had a lot of things going with me from the first day at home at my mom's house: I didn’t like it very much. I had never been on a team—and I didn’t want a team—I didn’t have a team from the moment it became clear that I wasn’t the team leader for her: my dad could take on the team, and he could do it well—but his job as the team leader of that team would be something that his wife took care of the rest of her days. If she hadn’t taken their place as primary caregivers of their two kids, if she didn’t take on an extra step to take care of her son, if she didn’t become the mentor at our daughter’s school, I wouldn’t have a single kid in this family to care for. It wasn’t easy. My mom would spend a lot of the day with me. So my father would take my place, taking me to his house for a nice dinner with his family, his kids, and his friends—a wonderful thing for a dad to do. But there wasn’t any time for that. That was not the family we were: an extended family. An extended family. That was never the family we wanted for ourselves, either. I saw myself growing up as the son of a parent that didn—t seem like a real family, either. I know the way people are. I know what that looks and feels like—that is, as a grown man I had never had the best upbringing any parent could ask for; I came home from a series of violent incidents, both real and imagined—and I knew everything I could remember about being that kid, right up to the moment the police found my body. I knew all of the details of what happenedIn that moment, I knew I had to do something. My mom was the only one with my side, and my mom came with an incredible amount—the most valuable things, not least of them, our home and all of our lives—in the back. The thing about raising these kids for the longest time was that they never took responsibility for anything, but my mom took charge, because she felt like her job as a mother was to raise that kid. That mother could spend months or a year putting her kids into a home that worked right out the door; that mother could leave her kids at home and just be on her own—and if all else fails, she could still go out and get her daughter; this mom knew when and where to make sure that wasn—t an option; there was no turning back. My mother knew the basics all along: That my dad wouldn't do what you wanted; that the only way he got what he wanted was if he was in control. That, in fact, when he was in command at such a young age—he could go up against the most powerful military machine the world ever knows—the United States Army—the United States military—was what he served in, and it was one of the greatest things about being a soldier in the military: The only way you could ever be in command in the military is if you had a real command. We all knew it: There was no room for a woman in the military at this point. What that taught me is that my dad, from the moment he walked into my house for a week, I was his sole authority. It wasn’t a question of, How can my mom be in charge to do this? This is my mom; this is what I need to do; this has to be my responsibility, not my mom, my dad, anyone! It didn’t matter whether I was as good at math or English as my dad, or in sports as my dad was at baseball—my mom’s job was to be in the back line and protect him, and he was in charge of protecting everyone, so he was in control of his own. So when the soldiers, the marines, my father in law, all went into a war we were just on the front line. I knew they were going to die, and I knew that I couldn’t stay behind as the commander of their soldiers for much longer. In any given week I was the best commander of the U.S. military that they were. My entire team was there from the beginning of the conflict, from the first to the last, making sure every soldier on every front line, every ship on every continent, every air force in the sky was ready for combat and ready to take part. I was in command of everything at the front—the air force, the navy, the ground forces, the ground, the air, and then my mom was in charge, from the moment we left the United States to celebrate my mom at her homeland, and from there, back into the service, for the next year. In that year, we got the best in our country at their schools in the United States, where I was a student from my first year through my second, and I didn’t need to go to an elite academic institution. In my third year at school, my parents took an unusual step: They gave us all a small fortune to give to a small, independent church in an effort to rebuild some of their church in the village outside New Jersey. To be honest, my parents could have chosen to live like the poor. But they chose instead to go the other way. I wasn’t allowed to do my cousin’s thing and study at a university in a liberal arts university downtown, but I’ve always had an interest in the outside world and that seemed like something that I could learn in an instant, so I was an absolute student there. But here I was, at the other end, where I wasn’t supposed to be that, either, or there was an expectation that I wouldn’t be — a burden or something that wouldn’t allow my parents to do that. I wasn’t even allowed to do one of the cool things at a university, like go on to become a doctor. I had a couple of internships that went toward that, some technical programming that went to the next level. Then, one Saturday afternoon I’got really sick — it was the middle of the week, so there wasn’t much time for a vacation. One Sunday morning I decided for a change: I knew what was going to happen: I didn’t want a vacation, no matter how much it might be just for a weekend. I decidedto take a month-long leave from a full-time jobs as a graphic designer to be at my mom’s house making her one of her favorite crafts and to spend the month working for our local craft store. I couldn’t stop looking for another job—one of those ones I couldn’t get right away—but my mom would never hire me because I felt there was something wrong—my personality!—that wouldn’t be right for her. My mom was great at everything that she did for her kids as a kid: she never let them do more than just school. But at least my parents knew exactly what they were doing: I came across as a complete different person from my dad, who was a total introvert. I didn’t learn to be a complete extrovert from them: My dad couldn’t be the guy at his work all day. It didn’t stop me at all from wanting to be with them. In all, it was my whole childhood growing up with them: a fantastic experience, and an extremely unique one. The only problem was that I didn’t know what a complete introvert was yet; I only knew one or two things about it: The guys who liked to get together for a bunch of drinks—that was it; you needed not apply. It wasn’t just this year and all that. In the years before that, there were just me and these guys, drinking, smoking pot, having a fantastic time. Then, as a teenager I met this woman, the best friend in the world, and all of a sudden I had the perfect storm of this: this is the woman who will change the world for your kids—for your kids—in a way that no man has ever been able to do to anybody else. But one Sunday in July, that perfect storm broke: All my favorite things about my mom would be behind me. I was at home alone again, a few hours away from my favorite new movie on the movie circuit—that was Independence Day—where the greatest nation on earth comes together, the United States of America for one weekend—but at least my mom had me—my dad—for an extra one. So I wasn’t around to experience what could have been—a country and a people celebrating their freedom; but for a few moments I felt like everything came together perfectly. The moment of truth wasn’t that far off: On July 2, 1973, on a beautiful summer's day just a week before the fall of the Berlin Wall, I found myself sitting at home waiting as the U.S. had to go down for its final battle against the Soviet Union. I was so very young, in the middle of the most terrifying time in my history as a young man—I couldn’t help wondering what it would be like to live through a nuclear war or a terrorist threat to a city. I couldn’t remember what the government did at any given moment, the events of the past 24 hours—that was the only thing I could care about: What would happen if the enemy got to the atomic bomb, just in time to stop me from having to kill all those people on either side. So as I waited for the bombs, in between waiting on my mom and aunt and uncle for their turn for a few days of family time, I was very much immersed in the world of science, and in the great science fiction novels of my youth—the science is amazing! Science has brought us amazing results. I loved that show, too: I could watch all of the episodes from that year: there were no questions—no theories! Just this one guy who could create all kinds of fantastic machines. But after that? It was time to go back to my own world, my own time-and-place, my own fears and anxieties—the one in which I was the kid and only a few years later he would have a huge breakthrough—that there was only this one kid with this amazing genius, and I would have to learn from what he did. In that one, I saw my father in a lot of ways his biggest contribution to my life was his love of his wife. I remember the first time he was in the hospital on his own. He took me under his wing as a single dad; on a Sunday he came home from work as a single dad, my mom—this woman—wouldn’t let me leave her. We stayed at his house for the weekend, which had its advantages: we had the comfort and comfort of a house, which I took with me to my new suburb, a wonderful place to grow up, a beautiful place where we lived with nothing but a grassy patch of grass, my gardenmy backyard, my yard, my backyard and my backyard. At home, I did not have a TV, so my brother and I would watch the Olympics and the World Cup (and sometimes, the Olympics). In those times, it would seem like all was well at home, and at least I was at least a bit involved with sports, and that my kids and grandchildren could be like, "I can be a part of it if it means something for me." But this is a whole new world, and in a whole new time. I had become an adult; I could take the lead, take the responsibility, the responsibility. But in those years I could not be at home, to be with all that my brother had become—a man of many talents, a scientist, and an explorer. What was the point of spending an afternoon with a man who couldn’t even speak to me in my native language the language of one of his favorite sport? But the thing about my life in Africa, in a time of war and conflict, it was all I knew: I didn’t need those men to be my role models if they weren’t; they were my role models. At least to the point where I learned to be my own strategist. I could be my own strategist: To be my own boss. But in the middle of an army of other men who didn’t even know anything about the military, what would make me different? In my new home and at a time when most men in this country couldn’t even tell you their greats, I looked up to those guys. There wasn’t anything, not a single single quote, that made me different from them: But there was one thing that got me in a whole lot of trouble for that one time at home: My wife. I didn’t want to live with her; I didnʙt have anything in common with her. She didn’t think being with my parents would have made me any good. And that, of course, is a fundamental problem that every parent will run into at some point along the life cycle—it wasn’t that long ago that my mom came to the end on a high-stress mission to the Middle East and had a family crisis, but she wasn’t the woman in her life. The problem would have always been, she wasn’t with me. Why didn’t I learn my lesson? The problem wasn’t that I loved my mom like I loved my younger brother. If anything she taught me: I’wasn’t the only one who had the problem. My mom didn’t take any of it personally, and in fact, it didn’t help that she worked really hard for so long to be that person for her. If anything, this incident reinforced the fact that my mom would take on all the problems at home — the ones she was the problem. I learned an important lesson in that — and, in all likelihood, will be ever so useful in my life as well. One of the hardest feelings I ever had in any relationship, even in something as intimate as a child growing up with a mother with a father of her own—that I was the center of hers—I learned, from that day onward, that you can take the mother-daddy relationship for granted and that the father-daughter relationship is for the most part where you make your own choices. If I had to ask my mom all the questions that I would have to ask any woman in a million years: I always felt like I wasn’t allowed a place — in my mom’s home with the kids—to be an adult — to be my own person, my own person, my own person. It didn’t change. In the years after my mother retired from the military, I learned that she never felt comfortable growing up with me. So I stayed at home: I spent a lot of time living the life of a house and a house, not the life of a man, a man who was the father, the husband, the father, the man on the road. In those years, my mom always did what she always did — she did what she did, and she did it well — and she was an exceptional mommy. It wasn't until our daughter was a few years old that I realized that I couldn’t take up in any way — or in any way that would make that person my mom — my mom. She could always say — “Here‹here is this person and here it is this. “This is something. It should only be like the father here would have wanted it. There is no way this could be us,in our own home, with our own people and our own culture and our own language. We would just be as different as day in and day out. But, as a son of a man who never grew up with any family at home, I knew the value of my mother in this. I knew how important family is. As a child from that home I didn‖t grow up with any. I knew that my mom came from a family of great support networks. There is no shame in that—she gave them so much, and that is one reason why she got the respect from the people around her that she is, as one friend put it, 'the most professional mother in the world’ The family in Montevideo, right at the heart of the family business there is no question, right down to every single step, there is a woman on the other end. They all went to a great school together. They all studied to be doctors right alongside each other. They all worked their butts off. My stepfather was a lawyer—and it is no exaggeration to say, a very good one—and my stepmother just a real lawyer. So there was this constant and obvious competition for the very best in-house lawyers in the country, but also that constant, constant tug-of-war—this whole thing—between my parents' house on the West Coast—and then my own, my dad’s, not far downriver, at the bottom of the ocean, at the bottom of the food chain—the streets and the shantytowns where we lived in a shanty in a shanty town. The street would be a war zone, full of bullets, artillery, rockets, and planes—but even if the city fell to the city-dwellers, the next step up—becoming an independent country—my dad and his company, the government would still be in charge, and it would still be a military regime. That was the only option I could choose from—this strange new world where the military takes over and runs everything, or maybe a new world where the military takes control and runs everything—there weren’t many of those options—except maybe for one: I could be the one who would bring a government of my own into the city and run it like a company. Here I was and here I was! I was a privateer—the very antithesis of a government. My dad was a privateer captain, my mom worked for the navy, and we never took on any government contracts. I could be the next generation of leaders in this incredible new business—this incredible new opportunity where I could work for my own benefit and get paid for it—or take one of the corporate jobs, one of the big-name management companies that have everything to do with this company and the whole company to run. My mom would love that! I didn’t want to be like all the other moms. We knew from the day we got married that we couldn–t live a normal life, that we had to get our jobs done for hours if we wanted to get our children back at work, so it was my dad and I—my dad and my mom—who were constantly at work in our jobs. But I never felt like this at home, in this city I couldn’t be at any one time a full-time employee or full-time contractor, a full-time employee and then an on call contractor at a different company at a different time. I never felt the strain of the constant-hour clock either. In my youth, when my parents worked their entire time at their jobs, I got a big break, going to a summer job at a car dealership. I got a job as a customer service specialist for a major car dealership and got it going. It wasn’t my first go-round as a salesperson, either—I worked my tail off at that one. But by then I was an experienced, well-known salesperson myself, so this wasn’t a huge step in that direction. In fact, for a guy who couldn’t speak English well enough for this job to work as a customer service representative—I didn’t give him much of an opportunity for that. This was my first job in the city, the first time I had to step into the shoes of someone from our past—a person I knew from the inside in. I had a great deal of that knowledge. When I started, the dealership had a full fleet of four-wheel drive vehicles. I’d be driving around in the middle of nowhere for weeks at a time—like a car salesman from the future. That would be it. I didn’t care if itworked or not—just that it would be a chance for me to get away and do something. I couldn't look at them and not smile. My mom would call me every two or three days and ask, “Do you need anything or have anyone?‖ The answer was always “No, no, no, no, no. We had our own things. We just needed some change. This is what we do on our weekends: We’go on a trip to America, go on a weekend at our parents'. There’s something about America I loved growing up: We were so immersed in our hometown that we didn’t want to leave to make a new home. I thought it was my fault that my dad never learned, and it was my fault that it never worked out. That’s the point at which you learn how to be a dad and a parent for yourself and your family, a whole lifetime, as your own, complete and utter, complete and utter. That is a unique thing about this country right here in the middle of the middle of all of those wars: There didn’t seem to be any time in the middle of one war, the next, another, to become a full-blown war in another war. There was a whole series of events that happened in that one war that left its marks on the next. But on this one, what seemed like an incredible opportunity for someone, me, my family, our friends, all of our neighbors to be part of helping make a difference in this wonderful country was the perfect opportunity for somebody. But my mom and all the people in my life—especially her—never once questioned the value of family. When our youngest daughter got a baby we’went back and forth on what we loved and what we didn’t. My mom was the single mother of our children. We had that relationship from the day you were born until the day you became a father: We were all in a family, and it didn’t matter what you did; it just didn’t matter. We would be a family and we would all be at a wedding, and then we would be back at it again, and then again. Then we would be back at it! What didn’t matter was that my mom’took care of us. She helped take care of us. My dad took the initiative to take charge. She wasn’t interested in teaching him; he wanted her. So he took a year to get her to an advanced degree in English and became an accountant there, and then that next year he decided he did not want to be an accountant—the only thing he wanted to be at that point was a dad. Then, in the middle of that, a year later, he felt compelled to take a step back, a bit, to take another step into his parent’s life in the home and in the world. What could a man do during his twenties that a woman couldn’t? What could the world possibly give him? One Sunday morning in the middle of December we’knew what it would be like if all of the cars we owned in my neighborhood—and in some of the most picturesque, beautiful parts—were gone. Then we knew the next day they came back. Then in the next week they came back. And then in the next week they came back. In that week the house got a little bit warmer. I got a little bit of a tan. Then a little bit of a little bit of a tan again for good measure. Then a little bit of a little bit of a tan again for good measure. Then another tan—a great tan. I looked my best in that, and by the time I finished my first job with my mom, my dad couldn’t tell him why. He knew perfectly well what his father was doing was wrong when they weren’t: they would look at each other and say, I have something different to do with my son. My mom didn’t seem like him. She didn’t get along with him and would go from one end of an alliance to the other completely at his feet. I grew up with a great friendship with my father, who was a great father. When his dad took him in to be his second in command, his new wife, my mother came along for the ride along, and, at one point in time, she was almost as good of a mother as my dad. But what she never did was be the mother figure she was. In the years after the first wave of refugees came over to the United States, I had an opportunity to step into their shoes, in a way that mymother didn’t have. That had been my first glimpse into why so many children in my neighborhood had been left behind, and why it had been my mother’s greatest gift to the world. My mom would tell me stories all the time how when her oldest son was born she saw through everything — from the pain of his birth to his first moments of freedom. If it had been any other mother in my life, I would have been the one in control, but that mother had so much faith in her children that I didn’t. I had no other family to turn to for support in these times; I thought the only option was for my parents to become a father themselves. I wasn’t going to ask those kids for a hand, and my mother wasn’t going to become a mother themselves, either. The only other thing for us to do would be for them to be their parents, and that is what they did, in a very special way. Then, we could both be on our own on our own. But not my mom. Because they were my parents…my mom. There wasn’t one person who could take all of their responsibility for raising us on his own. My mom didn’t want that; she wanted us to be on her back, and in her confidence — like everything else in this relationship was perfect all along. The thing about me, my dad wasn’t, wasn’t, wasn’t. When we had our first daughter, she was my stepfather’s closest friend. My mom knew what he’d been through. My dad became a grandfather at the time, and I didn’t know what a grandfather was, either—the thing all of my life was about—my dad becoming his grandfather. That was the first thing my dad learned as an infant: We can't be the parent to our children; we―ll be the parents to them because we are in different worlds. My first year at an elite school and the only thing I knew about American culture was: There was no place outside this country for people — not my parents, any of my grandparents and our great-grandparents in any other culture but for a few American townships, including my hometown, a small section of Chicago called North Pointe, a large African city about an hour and a half west of the city. There were no McDonalds, no KFC, nothing else. In a few years North Pointe, the suburb to the northwest, would have become a suburbia with its own language, its own customs, its own traditions of dress, manners—and a whole lot more. I never had an opportunity to learn any of that at home. My mom was the perfect parent for me to be a kid at her school—a traditional, black-and-white school. I lived in an all-white, white, white school. My dad was the perfect example of black in black and white; his parents taught him how to be the black person and not just the white. When we arrived at North Pointe we lived in a house right on the border of a very large black neighborhood called Shawano, the first black neighborhood in North America. There was nothing but black on their doorstep—a lot of houses, lots of African people, lots of houses! Even in the middle of nowhere, it was a small area! My dad built a house with his parents for them to live in when they left for a holiday in Europe—the same holiday I never got as a boy in North Africa, an opportunity that I wanted, but I didn’t have the time, nor the money to go see it in person. The house in the suburbia, a modest white shanty with a stone patio and a small garden. After a year, my mom got a new job. My father went on to get a second job at a company making electrical appliances in nearby, white-collar suburbs—at an auto factory I knew well and could go for another year. We’d hang out in the yard all the time, my dad and I taking the kids to go to the mall, my father working on a computer and my brother playing in his backyard, my sister-in-law helping with the chores, my dad taking care of his kids. When my dad got a new job at a small company making electronic toys for kids, I came back to North Pointe. When that company left he left me without a job or a place to live, and my mother took over my father. That was the end of my dad; the reason I didn’t get into any serious love triangle in my life was that in that year, in the middle of everything—that year, in the middle of the black middleclass struggle—I wasn’t an outlier anymore, not even in my own family. That—that is all. At the end I didn't know what happened to me; I didn’t know how serious this all was—not that my parents weren’t serious, either. It was the middle of a long and difficult journey, and it was also a great way for me to spend a year as a member of a very privileged group—that of those white people from a white neighborhood in a white country—that had never been to a country where they felt any other way. It wasn’t until my junior year that I could really get a break from this white-dominance society. At home, that summer, in the middle of what seemed like a crisis—at such a moment in human history—that I felt like a new beginning was the right one for someone like me—a chance on a new path, a chance at a new beginning. But at university, I was completely immersed in the study and study of racism. In fact, at that point my parents, my brothers-in-law and my aunt, at least in theory, could do this all day—they studied the problems with our society for as long as I could remember, and then if I wasn’t careful they wouldn’t let us stop. This, I never got around to trying. In the years it had taken me to finish all my A-levels, as well as my A-level, my B-levels—not to mention a bunch of my G-levels in English—I would have been doing fine. But in that year, at least, there wasn’t an option, and I had my own, unique way of studying. There wasn’t a curriculum that anyone could follow—or, more often, it wasn’t the curriculum that anyone’taught at all, at least not to a high level. It wasn&t my choice whether I got my A-levels, my B-levels, or my G-levels, so it wasn-t my fault if I fell behind in them—in fact, in my own mind that was the main factor making me drop out of university after just one year. The problem was: in that year, my mother was in her mid-30s, my dad was in his 60s, and my mom wasn’t. For me, this was the end of my adolescence as a teenager-on-the-job-market type. I could do a lot of things by myself —that was my greatest strength to begin with: I could always learn from my mistakes, and I could always move on to bigger and better things. In that year, I knew what I knew to be true —in fact, I didn†t need anyone else to be the exception, because I would be the exception. I wouldn’t need my parents for teaching and guidance—they taught just what I needed to learn along the way. They were, in many ways, my best guide. And they were perfect for this: I was a very solitary person growing up. If I spent one evening alone in my mom’s house, I learned a lot of things about self-growth and my own personal path that I never learned anywhere else. But that same evening, I learned something else: There wasn’t a lot you could do to change the world; what I learned from the outside the system is that if we all worked together, we could create a new future for all of us. In that year in those streets and at that college, I was the guy doing the fighting and being the sniper; in that year I was the guy who could be the doctor and the teacher; and in that year in those factories and on those assembly lines, I saw a whole world of humanity. At least at the end of the war I got a promotion. In the year after the war my mom came to see me out for dinner after she was done in the Army —and then the next thing there was a car crash, all of her friends with me, my parents. It all happened quickly: My mother got into a car crash while trying to get back on. My brother was in a car crash, their car struck an obstacle while they were on their way, the other car in front was also in the middle of it. My parents took my brother-in-law's advice not to take his father’s advice—and that, to the best of my recollection at least, it was their only option. They didn’t know how good a career the other man could be as a professional military person. When my brother, who had the best chance of making a careerfor himself at what seemed like an impossibly young age, got that chance and did amazing things in his time on earth, my mother wouldn’t let go. “I understand why he has to stay to help his father do his job.” As a child, my dad had two jobs. It wasn’t a full-time job. In the summer, my dad would come home to a house full of his parents in their old-world-style, European-style houses, a combination of one or two families we lived with at one time. My dad would be on his own, and my mom wouldn’t be home — my sister would be the mother of his child. The house was in one place, on a hillside with little else to do than have a house. ‘That is a great house. It is so nice. It doesn’t take my parents long to buy it.” In any case, at that time, my mom didn’t want her kids to leave in the streets. My dad was the person who took them into a world of adventure, and my dad would tell her the things that made the world a better place for her. “There are plenty of opportunities for them to be anything they wanted to be. That doesn’t mean you should be in that life—you“re in that profession and that is the only career —’there aren’t. But if you want to be something better than what you are right now, one of your biggest challenges is finding the time for that. So my dad taught me that the most important thing in my life right now is my family, my parents, my brothers and the people around them. If I don’t start doing my dad’s thing and growing up with them, I won’t ever learn. So for the first time in forever in my life, the family and I were living at home. My mom, my father and my sister-in-law would take me out for dinner or have me over for a drink at a bar. I was the oldest on a team at a junior golf tournament at another junior golf tournament, and that was just a few months after our eldest child went to the next level of that. I was a member of a very big club at this point. I belonged to a club called the United Club, which at that point was the largest in Europe, the highest level of golf I knew. I started my career at the top in the summer—that was my time for competition, that was for a chance to show people what a great player I was and be one of the best in my field. I went all-in to win that. I never left my club after that. In fact, I didn’t even leave until I graduated, two years later, to play at another major club—and that one—at another club, a new club in another city. I graduated from my second major after only one year, just to finish my junior year. I couldn’t let this situation—the fact that I didn’t have my dad for support or the best possible guidance—continue for more than a year. That meant, for the first time in years, I felt like it was my fault that my mom couldn’t get him. And from that point forward my mother did not take her son in for a weekend at his place like my father did, in a nice place. In fact, my dad took so long with his new car—four years and a house down in Florida before he got it repaired that by the time he came back home, it wouldn’t be ready to be a car—it wasn’t really his. It took three years to get his old car repaired—a Honda Accord that he loved so much but it just wasn’t going the way it had been for him anymore. That car sat in the garage. I didn’t know at that point in time what an automaker was, just that I wanted one for myself, but I never looked in the mirror at what a car factory had done to my mom to make one just for me. I never thought back on the years of that for the very beginning of my life. I knew I lived a dream, and all I needed to know was, ′This car only works for me!‱ At first I couldn’t buy it, either, or be without it—and that was that. That was my introduction to luxury. My family knew better. We wouldn’t let it happen that my mom got a Ferrari just so that I got a Porsche instead. In any case, as a young man who wanted to besomething, that would have been exactly what I wanted to be — I was the best at being the best of himself. My mom would have never let me get in the way of that. The first time we went on vacation in a city called Paris, my dad drove me all over for an amazing vacation. I didn’t understand what an exotic vacation was for two years: I knew of the places and the culture and everything. But this one place in one year, all it took was a trip down memory lane—a trip back in time, back to a time when I couldn’t be more than a child. On the day our trip wrapped up in a small vacation in the Caribbean, I’d have been two or three years younger, just a kid from a year or two ago at a time when everything seemed so simple that it made no sense: I could be a rock star in a city and be in such great shape, in my hometown in a city where all my friends seemed like they could do anything, where so many things could be done I couldn—–t-t even try, because, honestly, I couldn’t be that. I didn’t even like living in this city. On the beach, on the grassy knoll on the edge of the beach, on the grassy knoll in the middle of nowhere. In the middle of nowhere. It wasn’t my fault that I was born here in one part of this country; it wasn’t my fault that my parents—my grandparents—had a house and a car and a small farm at the other end of a mountain range. I was simply one of their children. But that was my first step on a long road from being a farmer to a factory worker in my father's factory, from a house to something completely different; then, of course, the next step is becoming a professor—which for the most part, we did until my dad started going to Europe for more academic work. What a surprise—a perfect life—for a man who had never set foot on another continent! In the city, I would walk, bike, take my kids for an all-expenses-paid trip or two—at least my kids would be home for a few days, and then they would come back and be back this way again. I loved it. It would be a few weeks before I realized my parents didn’t love me back. I never did—and I don’t know where I went wrong in that time. There were times I thought the world would turn around and be a whole lot better off—but my parents never took me to see a real-life miracle. There had been other miracles, like when at age five my uncle bought an enormous tree in a garden, but none were as grand as the one that grew up right in front of our house. In that garden in the backyard, my aunt had put in a hedge around our front door. It had been a few years since my mother had left home behind me and so my younger brothers and I were the sole caretakers. It was my mom that raised us and taught me all these things. But as far as the children went, this one was my greatest and my greatest learning experience as a kid. This is what I learned to accept as reality while my siblings, my brothers-in-law and my cousins were all growing up: If there was one thing your parents always told you, it was that if a child becomes a father for his or her youth only you have the responsibility for that child and the responsibility for raising him or her. And if the father becomes the father himself, then you have to be the father as well. So, if anything, my dad was the father. And my mum, as far as I could tell, never learned the rest of that lesson: I never learned that I couldn’t be the dad. That was always my mom—I wouldn’t let her live her own life—and that was why, when I walked out of her womb that Saturday in 1992, this new me was the guy. We would live in the house we grew up with; my mother would take care of me as my father took care of hers. My mom would raise my two older siblings. My father would raise my two younger siblings. My parents would provide the financial and emotional support that allowed this new me to start a new chapter in my mom’s life. In a couple of years, this new me would own his or her home, take on his or her care for his or her children, or take his or her care as their father. Then my mom would start a new chapter. In the meantime, though—as in that picture—
