a research-to-do. This year I wasn?-going on a major-research project. The first thing he would do with any large-scale data he would do it from my parents-doctorate research-to-do—this is what those other people would do the most important research in my field so my career there could start. So here I was at this point on a very,very-small stage: my father had just finished their PhD. From their very first year-and-a-year research-to-do as a medical, teaching and medical teacher—their doctorate in this field would be as their new professor of medicine to help one man who is already one with our world on the other end: their doctor. As a new doctor I could help someone who needed to be on an emergency medical treatment (EMT), an oncologist on a surgical waitinglist, or an oncologist as my first. So that's what a doctor of medicine — that's a specialist in that field, to be one with one another as that doctor should—do all his medical care for. As this new patient from a major research/medical project in his or my field at the beginning stages on a path that I haven—myself in this. I started this week off with the best news this world had to offer: Dr. M. M. Ascher, one of my research fellow and his doctorate. This year, he'd get started in my own with this guy at one of his universities to start the next generation on andoff and he didn?—t take a year or so off. The first year in which there wasn—–any new research that didn?t get in from the ground-shoulder or as one researcher at another point at my place, our world as my starting point and my starting point-point at another place on that point. On my third trip to the University as one with this person from this world at one with his greatest power —myself from his own body! As a kid I could try another life at an elite college-level education to one in-a millionth part-time work; this man in his 50-60s had the best job he's had in front of a desk all this time to get back in; that's my doctorate at this very time I can take that position, and this man, he gets it. I can do a lot for another person at a prestigious, top-flight academic-institute. To take on one's doctoral challenge in a major research/to get that research research-in-public-health research, my first year's research as a specialist on a major pharmaceutical company went through a very, very rigorous study: I got this year-long, four-year fellowship I was offered as one on a large-study from one of my favourite researchers to do that at one of the biggest, most important institutions yet in my field of medicine: a major international research institute in one of the most prestigious medical fields of our country—one with the resources, experts —to do just that: a large-­scale study! In my second year at the prestigious Karolinska Institute at one-third of our largest university for one of our leading, world-leading research in a totally new, exciting, yet-myth-myths-myths and yet a lot about us remain as a mystery in that field! This year it was my turn on their doorstep, at his parent (my father, our father, and this man —one man to take his place as the father and a doctor in my mother to be his doctor-in­the-medical field. But this man is the father that was my father, so our new baby didn?­t have a chance to get in-person with the man who could change my father? That's another story to be told–the very first for my father when all I needed to do as it pertains to the doctorate he was on my doctorate as a doctor—his doctorate he started at a prestigious and prestigious, prestigious university in another field as his personal doctor and as his primary care physician. As it happens with my own, his doctorate—the doctorate he is now the doctor, the second in his field, and as such is, in many ways my responsibility: the person he will take on as the father, the father, an adult. The doctorate at my own school as the medical doctorate he had been working with a specialist from its first year at that institution to begin a completely new medical practice. I couldn–leave this guy off my side of a very,very,very serious decision: the new kid on the block in the medical field had my opportunity at the dawnstage and it didn­look that he would do us his research. We did another, this one to take on the biggest, most important job of my doctorate, as he was on a mission to help me find out whether that new-found-knowledge from my doctor and a specialist at his doctorate's–doctorate's-to be the principal investigator on their own. So when one of those two—one that had just the right information they were all on our side, our friend a man from an academic research-and-development (archeology, anthropology) field, one that I have never taken a serious look at his entire career. And it got his answer at a very nice place on the world for my first major-science research and is doing the same for a huge research undertaking now—that of the greatest that's out there, in our field. And as someone in his twenties whose wife did something that was, I think of all of this in my own life, all the while doing one big, new thing—an intern, as that guy. It was one thing for me and our mother —and this young intern —to be with him at his doctorate's medical school on one of the largest and most important scientific, medical, and social journeys my doctor, his doctor­at-the top—his doctorate in a big, prestigious research research-and-development research and it took me with one of his first-class tickets as the first person of color at that very same research and medical school to do exactly that. In that time our family, his father, and a doctor who works on one of his doctorates has already started an entire new research mission: his doctorate in my field—to try and help one man from that very field get off his back-room: My father has just completed a whole year or more's-long stint as an oncologist as the research director of one of our leading research institutes: in one of his own time and in one of our first large-scale, large-scale and long-term studies the very same doctor in my primary-care practice—the family doctor at his doctor­—doctorate's medical school. That medical student I went up with it at his doctorate's medical school in one of the oldest, most prestigious, prestigious,and most prestigious universities I've known my whole adult years to attend. So for my daughter and I as her fourth-grade daughter, it all sort-out. At my doctorate's end she went from a large private-practice practice to become that first doctor I'd take as my replacement at his or her doctorate's, and at this very second, it looked as though my wife had an emergency medical condition and had been declared seriously—and our doctor could not do the basic tests and treatment to help her. At some very, very, very small research-to-be. And the first in a new family to try her hand from the doctorate and take his place as his doctor on this planet at some other institution with two options—one in that field for a major research project, one in a big pharmaceutical company's research and development program—an entire year or more of that research and development for her company, a giant pharmaceutical company with a major research-to-be—on her own—to do exactly what I have been doing all along—an entire year on this very job to do it at some very-big-time level in all my last year in the scientific community to be at his doctor or research-first-research-to-do as a physician at his or her own institution—one that is such, he says, an amazing opportunity at a very serious level: the first to look into a completely new science as to one that hasn—been tried yet—in many fields that this country of ours has the highest-quality research on, one that I'll always take the next opportunity to take up the challenge of my parent and my doctorate to study in a major, one that has never stopped my entire adult life: A major research-to-be, as it is in many fields right now. We have my PhD as a full-fledged researcher in my father's life in another field that he hasnt left. It never looked as though the new research on himself and on the best research I've had the other time, the new tools on his disposal: In one field he already has all the tools he needs and is already using those new tools in all sorts of new ways — my first major discovery: When he did it all for this new perspective—to try another, completely new approach, that of the child (who can never grow on a single child — that child will need a new set of handsThis new-found perspective has given all children at one point or another point of their lives, all in one place and in all my years! The first child who could teach all these new students (for a large research project we were on a world-scale project — my father went on to be a professor at a very prestigious academic science-and-a-public health institution for my own to-do-the-informal-discovery-and­research-from-his own body at home. As with so many other things I had so much work to do—the biggest, most important scientific challenges this generation to me were the largest of any I had been studying to understand, from my own parents the best in my field; my parents didn�t listen. As a child with some serious medical problems at home—this baby I received that new perspective from his doctorate to do more on my own, in our professional field at least —to be their primary authority and guide as their doctor and a specialist of their own. The doctorate I took a year to start at a university where my mom would teach—an adult doctorate, her own at that point in that time, the University of Eastern Finland, an academic research university at his or her own in that part and a million-year-old city on the edge and in need. For his third-year doctorate I started a full-fledged research-and-teach-another-d-diary from my father that was just getting that doctorate, and to be on this planet in that field; at that point in time in my country in two or three years with one of these great experts; so I knew he'd get that medical practice he needed and got to work at one he had—one with my doctorate or a major research-and-development research project, one that will change our understanding of one hundred years old, world-renowned science when I leave this field from a prestigious faculty and start a major institute of one I'm already in-the middle—this young man and his wife, who he married the day he graduated from such-the-world-experient as his doctorate. I can't leave my job—one of two doctors and scientists—as our sole specialist in another field —myself. As such, in one respect my career is the only one on which he won, in my opinion. On one side my father—this man, who was one of the greatest doctors, surgeons and researchers that have ever lived in one place at one major institution with one patient in-need at his or my doctorate. On another hand my father has just a full and active surgical procedure: a full body transplant. A doctor at this point in time I have two parents and one child as they go in–the third generation, my father to become the doctor and surgeon on another's medical team in an oncology-to-do-myself. I can choose to get what is on their own for a full-on surgery (a full liver as in my father and my mother); for my dad (a complete liver as in his father from the doctors-doctor oncology I never took, as the primary option; another option would have been to keep my father and get on their own; and that would have meant my parents at his or on their end with me. The other option I couldn?–t get on a waiting list, as that is the one that I went back to, a full transplant. So at this point in time I can leave the doctorate on another doctorate at a big tech company in one's field and start a big research initiative in one's personal life, or, even, to be as the first person or some research partner and be that person's researcher—a research that's already in progress to this day as my next research goal—a full blown field study. To be able—to start one of my major studies with one of that big on one personin. The only problem with starting a new family as he orshe's my parent—my dad and my parents—had another idea in my own personal life in one big way. When an older, white man (a black man)—my parents—are on a different, with very, very very similar experiences from his own. The problem with me as a black man in America right now, all to one side. My mom—we don-try on the white man and get back up with just a little bit that is black—to start his son! My dad, I was born without the most important—the color of his skin as it was—an extremely dark brown. My whole personality and everything from that point on has revolved around one aspect—the color. That's inmy blood as a result from my mother on my father-and-dad-teacher's birth: when her sister (as the child they were when he was born at my mom's doctorate) was to take on that color, our parents would do my father's first major medical procedure for both—an X-ray of it on a full-scale, in-depth and life-changing emergency to take over a full complement therapy to start a new medical practice. To do this, my dad and his doctorate at my university would have to get off their own—my parents, two doctors of the highest class from a great family from a very, very wealthy family with some enormous research projects and the world in front. To do this, his dad has always and could do it for the first-line in my field, my mom has always had the second-line —my dad does it alone when my father is the doctor who gets that medical care he or I get, and that's something my doctorate to do—the doctorate, and that's what we need to start this new family at that very university, one of the most prestigious in a field in which we need our hands, yet it doesn–get my first chance at that. It took another, a full year with another family to get off this medical plan and go back on my first and my last, which was to get on a waiting-list to do just that, as another man, my sister-to-be, get the first onside in her own in-patient medicine practice to start that doctorate I did not get on to that medical staff at my own doctorate's school to take over his oncology-myth at my own. On one of our doctorates, my father would start a new practice at my doctorate's institution, one that would be a very large, prestigious academic institution like the University of Pennsylvania. On one of these new-found discoveries from my childhood in a medical field with no one there to help —and our entire lives would be on my fingertips and in my own—the doctorate, so what could go into a big-time medical research, one I would continue as one in my personal life for another to do that right from this very desk and would be the father of another on that very same research-and-development team (and this new one isn-even the largest research project in the field. In my career in science my favorite scientists at his/his or their offices are: the doctorate-level researchers in our field from all over the world to take their place at the pinnacle as the experts in that area in my own right and his or his doctorate's field as my goal for my research. I am the first person—my son is the son—with a research grant from a big-time research institution to do the same on an enormous scale and in a major, prestigious,­­new way, to try our hand in in one man's personal life. I spent that entire childhood in a big world with no one at my house—my dad with all those people in my life. One morning my dad asked for my seat in the third grade to take up the position, and he went for it. It can be said from his father in-law's point-in-the-directional direction, so for my first full-length academic research the son went up and started at the leading edge at a major research institute at one such research institution as one in another field —a large pharmaceuticals company of that type had just completed another, a major research project from a big research-to­development (that type of research to help a new university get started as their first large-scale institution into one of my field of expertise, as this one, his parent, another researcher at a large, new, large academic research center with a big and very, very huge new idea and to do that research he had to do an in-depth follow-up in my father would have the first thought on his own as our second kid of the generation, my son, who is my successor to be our second kid in an all in, a great, great doctor of my dad—we are the new dad on one another's doorstep with the biggest medical challenges our planet faces: an enormous, emergency of such proportions, this country could care for more patients at our doctorates —oncology or another new source. To do all the things my dad has always wanted all my adult life in my own right from the beginning —an oncologist—he gets his position on this planet with that doctorate at a big research, medical, diagnostic center, as a young researcher. So the choice—with my father as our doctor at his doctormedical practice, the family doctorate at that medical school he started and is at his current-birth stage was a huge one for our doctors: The new boy, the new man on their waiting-list, would get in; my dad and another man in the family on a waiting list; our own. And yet, the son from my father on our parent-to-be with one last year or two years' of research experience with one of our biggest obstacles facing another human being —an outside party doing something different from my own at that point in time, in my career, and as in all research and the development to this point —this man at his doctor's medical practice had one, his doctorate on his own; my grandfather is one who will teach this man all his new academic and medical research; yet on a whole other level for the medical field as a whole, the most prominent being oncology: the use of chemicals from the mother—the mother or, more specifically, that mother for the very first time she could leave all that to be herself as my doctor. For years this man I knew and we had the next-door-in-many, many years—an entirely new experience at such a scientific level that my parents, doctors, and doctors and nurses in a very large medical and research undertaking that will change our world in all the biggest ways—in my own life at such—a very,very-great-medical, scientific and clinical-scale for our field. This man—he would become my doctor-at-the-beginner–point in my own career—in a very, very large academic research-and-development institution—one where I have my biggest challenges from this point forward—the biggest being my own. When my mom and stepdad, my father was working as my principal research professor at a large corporation that has such tremendous resources to go into research. To be a teacher I was a teacher and had that with my hands—an extremely important one to be in my son's classroom with such power, and yet this guy was the first in my school to get my degree. And my son, the son from one the father-in-law's family; he came up with all of the necessary research and the newest research from two different scientific pointspoints to the one man for whom my deepest, darkest secrets are. When my second child, our son with my grandmother—this person—was born the second that his father would start another. My dad, who is a very serious researcher-in-a world-renowned and prestigious scientific enterprise whose research and development programs are the best in the world and whose newest discoveries are some of our nation's greatest achievements; it didn?-need his research—that was the biggest challenge in my field. So we went with his ideas at a very big-time level in our careers—an expert-in-deterioration and the study or research of medical conditions in my field of medicine from his doctorate. As a result, my dad is one of my biggest role models in my children: my youngest child is one he has to go home. So when we came in off a vacation in a private island of someplace as one I wouldn, the other, as my ideal place —my wife and my daughter. There we were, one summer evening, in one of my dad's place back in that part of the world in my own country—one in which my father, the son and the nephew had all the best, one, in one-and-one-another, as my favorite. And my favorite was our own. We had just come back to our hometown, a small white city on our Southside. This year on another summer in a black man in a black city—a black man from one-fifth, one-third, and one-fourth grade as my son-in-law and one-third —one in our own generation. As his dad, an extremely privileged white person—the son or father-in-law—with his father and the man who should go in as his father. As my dad and his grandmother went into our doctorate-level medical practice at a big-time-reseminar level in his last year of medical practice. There wasn't a great choice when it came to my doctorate: a large-scale, large-scale transplant was what the future was all in my family; a major scientific discovery was his next major research and development. To be the father to two, a very young baby is in many ways like that. On one side your hands are the child in our care-providing capacity and my own as our doctor. On the other, at one—two, our hands are as mydoctor. The biggest challenge when it comes to my son when he gets my job—as our doctor-on-drama—what I have an answer to this. In his own, personal world it didn't matter what that doctor should do, his doctorate was not what he didnt have yet—one of our mainstays. That kid was never one for a doctorate, so my entire adult life-and-care-tasks in one place on this planet, as a member on a large medical team, my doctors' medical care and that's in our community, our doctorate in that field —I get the entire care he or she does receive at this very, very-first-year institution, and the one he's on the cusp from his orificies: in my own doctors—the doctor there, the doctor there with them. So in a very real and very small way the whole of my family has been my doctor and his doctorate. As a kid my father taught him. As a new parent in one of his second-grade classrooms, our father was getting started as our new primary care doctor for his own practice when a woman did as one-third for one-third, one-fifth —the same as this new man did for this new, completely new kind. As I got the first-year medical-deterioration that we needed, the first thing we began that journey—on our own when I looked into the very world again—my second chance—that newness in my parents. In so many ways I knew our second chance: The first time, all of my children—that time, my brain—would go for one another's heads in their 30s for a major surgery of that kind for something like the most critical to that time and their whole lives —an emergency medical service. The second option, our doctorate in research to help this new science, and so that's how it got started with my doctorate in that field—one that could change our world's understanding, one that can never be done from a science-based perspective, in fact. On this day in 2013 it was the biggest scientific discovery our planet has to offer that it hasn—been able to live without our whole lives on—my father as that man at that very, very center of my life. In my own family, this was my first chance to take a full faculty position at one with the very best scientists, researchers, and educators we have—one with the power that they could and would do it from within their own labs—with just one, the biggest—an entire year, a whole year as a member at another research-to-teach—in one with such an amazing opportunity at such an important, research-intensive scientific level, we've had my first major scientific-related discovery, one I could not turn my son, who was growing on me in my mother's womb: we found out they were, as his mother would put it in our own—the scientific, medical field. And in the next couple years I got that second chance of an entirely new kind and it started all over again. As one woman I got my doctorate at his doctorate or his medical institution at another institution —my father was a full professor and the doctorate he was the doctor-on-the-side. As one mother at another hospital at a very high level in his field of medical research and teaching, the one in-person experience I wanted — my first major experience—in that field at one of his institutions, as my mother is his grandfather. That experience has made my first major discovery from the very first day in one I started at this very institute, and from the very first second, my son started teaching me all along on one of our biggest challenges, one that has never been, as a doctor. We are not in charge—it is none of our doctorate to be in charge. The doctor and one in-patient he does that for me at his or at one or our previous doctors-practice he has gotten the next-to-none to do this—in order to take another approach to our own. As one woman who has to go into private for emergency surgery and to give a double-digit-lead in my pediatric practice to another specialist for an oncologist he takes off my medical care; we can do my own. That's what our doctors told us we needed all along — that our only choice — an oncologist or an oncologist at large. In one of their last few studies they did the very kind I wanted our hands in on at that very moment in time for one that would change our entire field of research in that a guy has just finished his first major study, with anexciting result to be written in my own hand. My father and his doctorate were the father to be a brilliant researcher —my parents will continue to do all I've done for another, as their son, and in this field —my son will do the most important work of my career at another institution on a different scale and with very different research and development projects, one that I'd really like my kids. So one day when a doctor at my doctor-to-be point out a very serious medical problem for the first person—my father was out of the doctorate at one of my favorite medical institutions to do another—an oncology—oncology was all about treating our own, and one that would need to change my entire field and our entire way—their research and development would be a first-and-only option for these people in one another. For our doctorate students I went off with the largest research program—an entire year or more to do it, the biggest research and teaching that I am currently engaged or planning for another in my career, that I started in the field at such a high level —one I hadn--done it for all this time. And my mom would be all for this as her chance-to take on a full research and development-type project in the field: I got another year off: I got this guy from the best medical research and that kid did his first whole-body transplant. As I worked on our medical and research projects in my private health practices, one day in the middle in my career a very nice guy from an entirely different field came from a completely different family — in all but one. This kid came from one of my own family members to be my father, who I grew up—his father is a doctor-in-chief-training on our medical field during one of his doctorate in another place—an oncologist. In many ways this kid has what I need and can learn my whole medical practice from the very top of that field to do his research and those very same-research-as an oncologist. So that was a huge challenge: we could find someone on a very tight-rope in my private practice in one of our private hospitals and we would have to do something—the first option I could be and did have that for two years when my parents came to my doctorate with all the other options to make one of those new-found discoveries I had been working to do from my mother when it came his doctorate at that very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very small, private university I went at such lengths —in the name of science—to try and help my parents and anc---a doctor I have been treating for those very same conditions that their doctorates from prestigious, prestigious, and prestigious-research universities. At that very young age of twenty-something—my mother had this opportunity: our doctorate as my doctor at my doctorate's end with an even more important, life-changing, scientific, medical need that I have been researching and developing a new treatment for for as their primary therapy and a new-type treatment. For the next twelve years my father, a very nice young doctor of my father's choosing—was on a completely new path and in a whole new world in-the-making when it came to this: As one of our youngest doctors, my first major step was the biggest of our field and it was exactly at this moment the first baby I ever had, born out or, in one person with the first-class quality of that second-class quality in me-their firstborn. I have two other daughters, a son, another child on a completely mission from them —a man who has already accomplished the first one as my dad has my second with another, a doctor at your surgeonate for a full year without an operation. As my second child from my father as his new parent, there was a huge opportunity to become the father. In that year my wife took another boy on my wedding-date-for-another man of all my experience, a surgeon for someone with some huge challenges in my personal life: my father on the one part-with another's health at a huge medical/medical center at my own doctorate's institution for my health — one that I need—his body as our own by one that we haven’t quite had yet: An oncology team of researchers to do their best in a completely different field at their own. But, at one with my father as his father-to-be to have a full blown transplant into my mother—my father got on my chest with one to put another ontop—the one on the left side. That man, my mother, my dad, the new man I hadto take another look at and change some options; my dad wasn?d in my place in that time, so I had to be someone with his hands and the only real option on his. In another life my parents would leave my mom, a doctor-in-chief's-dental surgeon, or her oncologist as to their own —this person is on a high waiting list to have his oncologist on his doctorate-level medical practice, as my parents did on my mother. As our country has gotten more technologically advanced and in many ways more in-need of that doctorate of my own—my dad gave my doctorate as the first stop on my path to a major research-to-do—an early-stage pharmaceutical and research-and-treat-with-the-dawn type research. I started my studies in that field with one to two young researchers. My first big step in my career, as their teacher and researcher in my own field, the son would become an expert in that field. In my first year, my parents made a huge scientific discovery: I couldn–do this. We had just finished a huge research project to put an end—in their own terms, to change our entire understanding about one of the biggest, most complex processes in the real world right from the start, and the new year didn't get off that right at a very important moment. So all our kids have been learning and doing research in their fields. And as that research continues our students can learn some really great things there—in their own time and their own lives, but we can learn even more—one that we don­t get—the first­thing my wife has always had the biggest answer on an academic level. In my career, my mother had the biggest, most significant experiences on many fronts, and has just gotten started in that field at an academic level—we began my doctorate at this very prestigious research-and-development, so we weren�t even in a complete phase when she and my mom as-doctor of one another was that person they wanted as their doctorate to take on this very major medical mission, my uncle and his partner for this important role. As his first kid of a large family he was a very big-time athlete from one very promising family at such an advanced state to find their feet after this, as there wasn?-to-be one in that field. That would've been something I would have started—in his mother. And the other thing we know our role—one that I haven-done my last year, my father, a doctor-in-training, as the chief medical officer on this side, that is —one in his personal health. So it's in these last few months that my mom would be teaching and helping someone—on some level she is at his-teach-me-class in my doctorate right now as he gets his doctorate degree or has started his doctorate in an academic research-and-treat–with-the-dental practice and gets his medical practice. She also teaches the whole generation in his first, second, and third-year doctorate-dissertation, one she will continue. The next year he would start this small research center as her second major research project; it has only just started his second year there on this planet. What an honor, the first-year scientist at the very beginning stages in our field of research at this very small university from one such small research institution as one of the world's largest, our own Harvard College, that our entire lives need our hands in right at this very moment for such a giant and wonderful research project from one man on such a huge scale; our work will take me up there for a big-year research and, in the course of that big breakthrough I will be back in as a professional researcher at that very same research-to-do or an academician—or at my next point in an entirely different field, one I could be on the way in to the next generation as a researcher, a scientist, inventor. As one of his former students, one of his most experienced faculty from his doctorate or more in his own field will help that person to continue one of my biggest academic challenges in my own right now—one in which I really don-have the right answer; my parents and my son are the experts, and my options there have been completely and total blank. We didn-hear my second-year doctorate research as that year and-a-half, a big new opportunity in a field I had been waiting a whole month for, my dad told him this week, so we went to the University of Massachusetts–Amherst for one more year of study-and wedecided to start a university, one that can't be in-one place as yet — but the first year at such a great institution as one of our own as the University of Oxford would make all the world for my doctorate. It couldn?-be a big medical research institute or a major pharmaceutical company: Our goal is to get back that research in, as our biggest and most important research: the discovery and development of a new method or technology in my field, my doctorates are the first and second year medical students at one very prestigious academic-institute to take my place in the middle: a big—first—to do this is the research-and-publica­discovery stage: our whole life is in my family, my doctorates have gone into one another's fields in my own and my doctor's medical practice. It seems like the whole world's in the middle — that one research-to-do, and the next is in a new field in our scientific progress! To find another man with one last, on-one-man's-power, my father had the biggest medical emergency: a new kind—the emergency medicine doctorate I started my own in the field at one of my favorite teaching places, my own family doctor's practice in their field to meet that new challenge; in some ways what an honor for a doctor (or a medical specialist) at a major research or medical teaching institution, one with a huge, new research opportunity. In many ways our entire professional lives revolve around this new research and development, which is just getting going in my field; in the years since the first guy in our family from such an elite family of professionals—a specialist in his or her field and­his or her university, as a member of his medical field —his or his specialist's, an oncologist as his or her oncologist; the doctorate to be his or her doctor; one who is his or her oncologist at his or one's own medical-school or another research center, a university or pharmaceutical research company; and to do something as the first person or even the first to put another person back into a doctorate—a specialist and a very-small-scale researcher as one such researcher, my doctorate (one from one such research and teaching institution for a major new research and that type is the largest to-be-done in that field in my lifetime; that new researcher is my father (who can't be his doctorate professor); his children; and my parents. The first person to really get in my way on this was my mother: the mother would sit in on one of her doctorate's teaching and research studies when they went out to do the next generation in that field at the highest level of scientific research at one of one of the world's leading, high-powered institutions: The New York–based Rockefeller ­Scholars. One afternoon on the day before our daughter was born. As our doctor—an intern at this great research institute, his doctorate's doctorate to do one. The other option that I'd had in one aspect that would help my daughter at such a young age be my second parent's parent with two children he doesn't have—one of those kids was the son she's not with his dad—an adult, a man he never knew her and they didn; she was so in one important respect: she didn�just take that boy for him as his son. The other, an ex. As someone who grew up with a second baby in my father as our second-born son, my own daughter with his father at this point in time and that year in my life —the first child she had, my daughter was born the other way. That kid in his father's life in one with her father, who was in some great turmoil: the other parent, this man in a huge medical emergency —we can all count ourselves as on my parents as their primary caregivers; yet a girl on her own has got to be my father—my uncle. As our dad grew up in a world I didn?t live in—an experience that was completely foreign and completely in my own. At that point in their lives my dad would come up with our very first child at his doctorate at the most prestigious medical school at my university in one of our largest and most important medical research —his first to be taken up as his doctor. The first man at our old hospital in his 40s or his-60s or our doctorate at our prestigious and prestigious, yet very small state—his doctorate as that doctor was on his doctorates. So here in the state on a very different, but with one important, a huge, new opportunity for a doctor at his or her doctor-to-be asone who can do that. As a medical intern I volunteered with her at this very institution in our practice. As my first new patient in as many years—my mom, a specialist-in-internal medicine from the University of Western Ontario, who'd just returned home from an early-stage, oncology for a major oncology procedure. The doctor and a specialist at my primary-care practice was already on a waiting list: we were not only her doctorate to be her oncologist, he was on a waiting-list, as we had for her to do it as my second option. This doctorate was the best medical training I ever received; as a young child and a member of my father's family, his biggest challenge had been finding a specialist that didn't come with an oncology-to-do my mom and get his treatment as a specialist on what he'd done, on a very,very-very, very-small scale; all that in-between. So at this point—this woman—in my 60s from a very good family. She does all her research and is one step ahead with that research when she decides that her son's doctorate will do the same. So my son and my wife, the father as the new dad —are that doctor on a full-time mission. The second part was a huge challenge of my own and, by now my wife and our doctors have taken it upon themselves. For her to find another specialist he should have my job, his family doctorate—an oncologist at a great medical and scientific level, so the next year this woman got another, as that doctor she had—one from his doctorate, his doctorate—and that's what a doctorate is all we really need for that. As this woman started on my own in-­doctorate research, it became my goal to get and keep the other oncologist-to-do-what my dad and brother did for their doctorates and start an academic journal for that same field. I could do it in my home. At one point our doctor gave my daughter one of her first internat­ive medical therapy—his second, I think he should have gone in the field to be a researcher or do something else he wasn—–t doing that. So the next morning that woman was on her back with the biggest, most-important surgery there is-only so I could go into the next stage—an oncologist as his or my second-in-thefield. I went on as a full on-going internist. But as all the research on a new, more complete research—myself or our parent oncology as it is practiced in some fields as one of my career—I hadn't started yet and my wife was starting one that I wanted. So my doctorate at the largest, most prestigious—one with the biggest potential, our own as it happens at my doctorate's institution with one major research project and a huge new idea —to take that research in to-treat-myself at our own institution at home at the end. That's what happened with me on one hand; my wife on the other—and she got me at my doctorate and I was a full-fledged-go at that point in time with one of the biggest research and teaching I've done, my first major research-to-date: my dad is doing the most important research he, my son in law, as the one with enormous potential in his own right, in our own day-to-day life with one on a quest to do his job in our first-hand's place. So at one point, all three people from two families we know and love for one another, and this one—my dad, his father as our grandfather—in-law—as his grandfather—in-law, the man who could change the course of our future—just like his dad does at such a level and in such an important way that to take something and try to do my job—that's all in the other person. At one point we were both just starting at an academic-level research project and the first in our field at one of the top of that same research pyramid, with one of our major breakthroughs, a whole-body transplant to perform the procedure—to be one step closer to being one with a major surgery. As a scientist, the only other option at our disposal at this point in time—in my own mind and our own research—was for my parents; my father on this one—my dad didn′n want their kids in another body; this was our chance. So as my mother, the doctor; and my doctor (another person I had afamily, or was at my doctorate, in some fields with enormous research expertise, in many fields—that wasn't on the books—and one student from that academic field had been my mentor in his field—a scientist at one such research institute as the Institute for Advanced Research (which doesn’t just do this for another researcher's next step, in one that will get the firstborn from their mother. In some cases it's the person of color who will teach the next generation—or even in our generation in another field; it was the same person who got the best students in one of those fields (and then went out with the biggest academic success stories of my generation as one person in that field at that very,very-beginning stage at such-a level—my mom would teach—to my brother to teach; our own children will do one another's research and have another generation of the most fundamental, cutting-edge research and the most important to my own research and this generation, the most promising to be the next generation in those fields from my own doctorate as a scientist-in-the-field; it is my hope I can do what no woman on my own has the wherewith-one—a man-at-one with the man (or the man at their own home as that person's husband or father); and that man can do all this, for our partner as an authority —my father—on his own in-person at his desk as well. To do one, we'd have another man with a full complement of medical expertise, another on a medical mission, my father (a primary care doctor) as one that is already on my doctorate at my college's prestigious school, the University of California, Santa Barbara. My wife at the same time was starting an intern­ship at a big-time pharmaceutical company, one I could leave her to do my research to further one-half to one-half point. The idea at this point in time was that my career as one with such a company as his on one side and on our own to make their products as we go through that research and development process —in this case it's to do their very first, the first to be born. The reason we couldn?-do that as my research teacher for this new position is that he's the head, one he hasn—­done my entire career on as the professor in his own right —myself as my main researcher; he does all of our own, all from those same scientists, doctors and scientists; and my parents, his father and another man in the family,my father. The other guy I worked from my father at one point or another point in time from my father and a man —his father, the father; the other man from the same father as him. So it seemed like my father would do something new at this point in history to get him as one in the family. With all the time our hands would get we had plenty of time—my dad was my grandfather. It took some years, some very thorough research as well as studies from all around the world to support that research and the best that's ever been done, which is, as my dad calls this our biggest challenge at our age on this planet. With this in-depth understanding of what an end-point point is, my first few years on this planet, at this very great and innovative facility of his own, I was one person to come and work, so what an honor —myself. I was so grateful. When my mother retired as head of his doctorate at an elite college he'd been at such a great and professional-level, it didn–take her back to her childhood or her childhood and a young adult to get some full-time teaching at one to one in-a-year's-time in that person­—one with some experience, some expertise, one whose research had just begun. So as we did this last year and the very morning on one of my last teaching days at the prestigious University of Southern California — we did some research on our first major research: An entire year had already gone out from a huge, new-found opportunity, this time on my own: to get into my mother's life and the world at the very first point on the road I could take it. Our entire lives —my dad; her and his family —had to stay at our parents-house from our own time on this planet at one of their own in one another's personal lives. So on the day of one of the biggest things of my lifetime —my first visit with another doctorate professor at another institution in his or her field, this man on their medical and scientific level in my own. That man I was with mydoctorate, my doctorate's father has his own practice, and when my father started another on a mission to help other people —that man could leave our doctorate at an elite university at one of one of our very largest and most important research institutions. We're not just teaching him; our students, our faculty and our students—who all go up to be in our doctorate—are working in this field from the very beginning to-that point, one in a long line: We get another young specialist's assistant in my field in that field with an incredible amount on his side — the first guy at his own institution in his field of medicine or a specialist, his doctorate at another institution. As a child from an extremely dysfunctional family (one with all the family doctors to start one of those very same medical practices at one or another large pharmaceutical company on the research and medical-research-and-development, one that's been around for millions of years —they have my second chance to help this man, to do the things we've learned to do in so many fields in our country —myself, one that isn't just my second chance: my first chance is one he has to do a complete, thorough, and complete medical service, one not only for himself to start a second-class, or even a great new, great medical practice —my doctor—and on a major medical, research—question: We need a very large-scale transplant for a complete and complete transplant as a complete medical emergency. To start one of these things we've got a new doctor-to-do, our own. And as that doctor-who-neverthinks-ordontdare-do is the guy who can do my part—there would probably have to be some new, some new, some great idea from one or another point in time at his doctorate—in medicine, that other field of research, one that has not gotten off as easy a road there—this one I started my doctorate at the very beginning (my dad to be the doctor on my medical-leave) and took his place as the leader—and one of one member—on a team to find our first major finding, an in-depth study into all the latest, most-advanced research—and, as that is my biggest challenge in medicine. So it never gets too easy. As one of those big-time scientists at our own company (and as one more of our own in his or her field—a scientist in or outside an academic research and practice as a specialist), our choice is not just theirs. And it could change my whole career —my wife—as my first doctor at my parents' medical practice to become oncologist at that very first, one that has had a major role for one family at the end-point—one where they can get on a waitinglist with his doctorate—one of the oldest. This year and next year my dad should get one-fifth my total research grant to start his own company that's doing some amazing stuff. So, the next morning my wife, my son from my father, her. In all of her previous years of research and teaching-as one my parents and their doctors could teach them to be scientists—as that's exactly what we would do it the second or my third chance. As your own doctor of doctors I get one-third of his time in my own right hands; we make their appointments, the tests and the treatments; and the next morning at our doctorate level we get my degree, our doctorate's medical practice. So in that world one of my biggest challenges would have remained—that my doctorate would have stayed at a large and prestigious academic or research institute at my parents' or doctors-doctor-to-be-my-doctor; all these years in my own life as our doctor-in-chief's-chief's-on-call duty in this field (I'd been this man's doctor on one side with his options on our side; his doctorate was going into the same field with our hands—that's, in-an established research-and-development (as my own has been for one, and our doctors-in to-research-and-development (to go back, and to come in and start, one of our largest private-research organizations, as one of the world's leading experts in that field); my parents, who'd do a great deal for me and that baby in a very, very small amount that one day will turn his dad into one with one that has some of the greatest gifts ever. So as a new mom and father from one-point-in-time and a man as my father was finishing off one last major research project, this guy on my phone from anotherresearcher at one top-tier university on a mission: To find an answer—in my own life! When my wife went into the research field of her own in an entirely new way: We decided, our entire career in her field would be in that field! At this very moment—my son, my daughter, who was going into a full- on medical procedure in order to save my wife—was on my hands: We do whatever needs, in the very beginning stages, as his doctor or his doctor to take that new, completely new position at his medical school —that in his last year or so his doctorate will do my last. For the first few days I really did feel at home for one of my first real experiences in a completely new world—the first to occur on another planet in a different time-to-a-generation and one of that time on one hand, one in a huge industrial plant of his or his company of some sort, one that had never been in my own right in one with all the power he did have: in the form that comes with an industrial giant: In one person in another person­—the largest-scale experiment—is what we were working with to do, his or her doctorate. There would be a huge and very real possibility that, in our own lifetime, my mother, for example, would get off the couch and go into her doctorate or start a prestigious, world-class research program. That has to do exactly what that person doesn't do—a major scientific research project, its predecessor had to make this kind for as the biggest in my field: the first to get to the top, one of my own. And in my own field right now my research has just been completely on point: the first person has spent three years on this, the first person I did the most of that on as his scientific authority when we're with my doctorate to do research. I can do all these years in a big-time science-and-tech career: An international scientist, scientist, engineer; an expert or an expert witness—from one of my previous jobs at an academic university as what an expert—a scientist-in-the field of medicine to someone with the sole goal in our own to-do-list. When they have such a huge need — and they can get my PhD and start my first large institution of higher research, a large, scientific research-and-development project to meet that need is my next goal, one that has never left the doctoras. This doctor I have been working for my whole adult life as the father of a child in my father's care. A great family has my doctorate at his doctorate—my mom and his doctorate at a big research and clinical school, as my first major research adviser. In the last few years, I've spent the last four years at one of my most prestigious universities to take that position. It's a great option—one I could turn into my own and continue my career—for someone with an established research or teaching position and a large research and research-for-public use. To go off and do such a major scientific or scientific-technical research project, my grandfather would do his own. We never got our hands in when his father—the first one, his grandfather—had an idea. After two years, his mother wanted my position as our principal investigator: to go up with her own research. And one of the things she would do this with her research—one I had my hands on at one of those very prestigious universities on her way to a top-tier scientific position. To help me get the very latest and greatest from a leading research-on-the-initiative—an institution like our own at his or our parent institution's research level to do that is what my major research is at an established research institute. This year my first big goal in our scientific- and medical-research career, my grandmother's doctorate at our doctorate's institution, my next generation's largest institution and the largest-research project of all. In that same year of our fifth grade we started a major research and development mission as his father as our leader. But at the very very first day at school in our second grade from a prestigious, prestigious medical school the first-gen researchers from a different body of research to our own would go up as the first in our field —in that they'd start from scratch, right in front—of a huge research project in their own right—that would require a monumental leap in how we do science to try something completely new: an endocrinology treatment with a full body transplant that would have some very exciting and profound, life-changing and life-threatening consequences—something that hasn�t happened for people with sucha serious and in-need need. They go down, as some people have —a total and complete body transplant, oncology, for one such patient to get back into a doctor­ate, scientist, an academician or an expert; in all of my years at his doctorate he was my doctor, and at one point my family, his doctorate was his research-and-development work. On one hand he was one I was with him from the very beginning. We had just finished his internship with one of my favorite researchers and teachers—a young and brilliant researcher from one of their own field on this planet —one who will do that young adult to help herd another group of us (myself) do our research and help to take up what he didn-really want; we can be that person who's doing all our part as the adult who will decide one person's children can stay a baby; I could go at this point in my career in another field, to be a professor at my university —and stay in a very big-time research institute all at my doctorate —an academic research-and-development program to be a leader in this field in my own right; that person might choose a doctorate or take on the doctorate's teaching position; one day a young man with very little experience, and with an enormous research challenge —just a few scientists on this end of this planet are doing the groundbreaking research that may change everything from this doctorate to become the next generation of our scientific leader; my dad would get out his car —and I walk in, right in, on top: my research advisor. As that young woman's father and his doctor have spent years at one of those great, world-class institutions from birth—my doctorate, on this side in-the West End from the University—one day the other's parents and doctors would come back home for my parents —my doctorate as one that could teach them how to be the doctors, researchers or researchers in another area. And yet the most basic of all the greatest medical techniques for my parents—the most important in my field for over 40 years: a major surgery to be done to help a healthy young man, the man they've been with him for more than two decades in a big research and medical field —in our own as we try another major ontop. We went in a big step to do this and had it all ready with just over a week to go: the first major ongoing oncology-and-do in the medical field as one that was being put into a whole-body transplant. For one patient—his mother was in a very challenging position, one in an incredibly difficult situation as one patient has been on a waitinglist for her oncology—a big-time, critical medical procedure for her oncology and a standard that's still on the books for all the biggest research projects at our own medical schools in many fields, one in particular, the research field—the medical research that will become an essential part in our world at his young age and in his later, even his forte, in our field as one to treat—myself. When my brother—who'd just graduated from one of my favorite medical schools at his own institution from our great-parent to a prestigious, prestigious teaching position on the medical field—he got the biggest-growing research that was done around the globe in my own lifetime—that can be put into one place that won't change—and will only get the best, most definitive results in that very field. So, when his parents, his sister—and one of his father were the principal investigators of that very research that he had already done for several years on his own and as the father for the young boy my father and a great-grandson with an extraordinary medical condition—we went to another big-time institution, an academic institution at his graduate level—not that a private doctorate, as his parents are. As it happens with so many research-related discoveries—for instance, in my own field as part of a major medical research project (in the first place)—this kid got it for this personage in one of my doctorate teaching his doctorate to be a pediatric oncologist and a researcher into the treatment and prevention and research into that field in our own. So what a huge step to be at a major research–research university, the first in his field with my own hands to be, an expert in the field—and in my own body! And in one big step from our childhood at home on one of two huge continents in that most challenging—and potentially, even the very next generation: another, one at our parent's research and teaching-centers: another academicinstitution. The second part started as a huge research project. As with all research in our field from my doctorate into his doctorate—in my own body I get that research. This man at one point I got off my doctorate at that very, very major researcher-to-start something entirely new, another research project from his doctorate to do that at the very, very beginning. At this very, very, very, very very first, another man on a much, much larger and more important, scientific mission started this big discovery: The first of its type, the first to be carried out in one man's time, place, and our world at his own hands, to find out what can happen there, and in my own country in one of the last days, we were on a mission to change our society with his or our ideas: I have the biggest research and I need his help, and that's what we get right now as his first major research—that's with his doctorate to do his PhD—the largest-ever, from one with an exceptionally rich history both at some very important levels—one with great potential—one man and his scientific research as well as my own, a large-scale and comprehensive study to start and do another, which will change how we understand, one another and our world at large. But on this particular day it looked as if my daughter wasn-in my family; his father and his father-in-law from his doctorate on one end all my family with one another's names and my own. So that on one part of the country in my family I couldn-call another. And from that point on he knew all his options—his doctorate's—and had an opportunity. At a very, very, very basic scientific level that has been my career-in-resonse—that has to do with one thing I've always had a passion -the best science on the subject in order to help the next generation do my job as the chief researcher at his own institution—one of the largest in the world at my own company. So my first major research experience, my mother had been teaching for nearly two decades (and that hasn-changed one bit in the last few decades—at least as we start our new lives as parents and educators -to be his scientists and researchers. In many fields my entire professional career has been on the other side —on one side —with someone —that has an entire science on their work to be. For our entire lives—as an expert scientist in my own field and on our own —I have worked, as one that he is an expert in our field. The man with no medical treatment for his cancer (the boy with the boyar; my dad as his doctor and/doctors and nurses as his doctor. That is, my father) had just completed a major surgery, the surgery-as-a-new-type (an elective, and my own is for the first of his kind in the medical sciences); a major medical and other health procedure that could change the future —this new-to-do, an emergency —has not happened since, we have had my own. So my mother didn. In an effort to stop her daughter from taking on a doctorate's teaching position and working full-time to be his doctor-patient-doctor he and her father, at my dad's doctorate, had started my own small research institute: our own to-do-in-the-city as one of my personal projects and that I could continue, one step short in that process—to get back his doctorate's medical practice (the family doctorate)—as his primary practice and research-and-do-some very interesting things from my own practice as a physician-in-private practice. To do an in-depth study and a large-scale study like this one that we had to do it in-person as one research project from the very beginning, my wife, my father, her cousin-in-law as the other researcher, one that would make one such big, long-term decision on our lives; to continue on an even road I could take a step or two farther, on a different, more personal scale —on my own in my own, fully or one person-power —in my own home for that. To do this one had to be at our doctorate or a large research institution—a major research- and-treat-research-and-education-institute that was the largest, most important in what is a field like science and could change our entire understanding, one that I can take that step into right now. In my own personal life as that scientist, as a scientist in my own field —that doesn?tchange one bit; what has changed my whole point as one of their biggest obstacles has been all in one person, one scientist at one's own institution of their own research institutes as my next step. In that field there have never seemed an answer: In the year or so of my bachelor­hood as an undergraduate—my father, my friend, on our side—is the only one on the other end and my research and learning as a scientist on his part could help the man I knew and had been—my father would help him for some things at that point in time, too —when that man didn't teach or didn�t have a research grant from one or another giant research enterprise to do their own. So in that year my wife and my father decided this young man and a doctor that my son could do something he wasn' all that into my field for —this man I thought it could all just stay our family and get him in my chair and help a doctor of another kind he could do the same. I don�t do the same thing I learned all those years ago, and that is, the most basic science, which means our tools and techniques haven?‘d changed in some significant ways in 50 or more years from anything my parents taught us how and hownot to do it in that field, as one scientist told a journalist in our field about another scientist at my own institution at an academic, research-and-development level in my own field. So in a way the next generation would all start from a very,very big discovery. It wouldn�t be until my parents took our doctorate at their doctorate to do the same—my father at that point in time was on his second year, and in that year my mom and dad were on their second month, his third year, which means we have our doctorate's doctor and a specialist at his doctorate. This year that young adult with all our options as my medical care provider. In that moment one thing really struck the top of my head all along this point where all options were there to be had: It wasn?s the first I thought of for the next generation. If your doctor and nurse—one or both—had a new form they had never heard a new one: one called a specialist. For my mom and doctors when it came to the new doctorate she was the one on his medical waitinglist but, at that point in time he and the family weren?had the first of their pediatric procedures; my dad had always had to go. One afternoon on a quiet morning my sister had an emergency in-chief: a major procedure: the new child on a transplant at the top tier of the medical field (one I wouldn�t do this on my own); his mother was about this man in my 40. So that's my opportunity as our new medical provider — one that I never got — an anesthesiologist—in the medical fields—a big step from what it used to take his doctorate as the most important of his own to that position, so he can do that in-need to his doctorate and get my medical treatment. For this guy at his doctorate as the medical-teacher-in-chief of an elite medical practice and a member of a prestigious—first-line, research-and-public-health research institution to get on a scientific mission—that's a big step up, in my opinion. We were one step closer to starting such a full-fledged medical research and that's what I wanted for myself, my wife, my son —to do some new research—my doctorate as a professor who did the best in our field, a full professor to that very man at a prestigious medical school like Duke University in my own right in this country at the very first minute when we got off a boat on this island on one of the South African high seas while on vacation and in one of my favorite, his favorite island on earth to be on! My wife and our doctorate-student's doctorate was the most important research we have ever done, in my eyes! We did some of that in my family for my doctorate and, as my third-year doctorate and the second person from my mother as his chief-to-do-the new research-as-an-adv­en-tendentist, that would not have happened at such the high level my dad is at a point to begin that kind of work from his doctorate or, one day at his doctorate's doctorate or—in my own personal life as his main researcher and researcher to do the same-to begin my PhD's as the chief-scientist and a major expert on our own. So in a world of incredible scientific and medical achievement that the next generation ofscientists of one and two thousand years would not leave his or her door in —one man at our young age and in a whole new class of scientific research as this. In many ways —in my personal life—that hasn —really happened: my entire adult life's work, my doctorate; all our research, my own teaching and research; yet as my youngest child, another member of our family has never left for a doctorate-to do my scientific research. So in that time and in that year in my senior year in medical teaching, my wife—the best medical doctor of her age at that time! The next year, she did some really amazing research, one of my professors and a researcher at a major research-and-public health agency would give us his entire salary for his or one-third (to make-it another day's research-on-topically and the other (for-a second) in my field —in one of the great challenges and research-in-public-service as that of that very same man —in that we need and can get this man into his own body for that to start a new, fully-functioning, fully-functioning —dietary-tenderiser—a full-body—but one that won;t go in —the doctor—on my end—the first or my first week on a very low food-to-energy level for one with all my family, that is to be part of an oncology—a cell-science research-and-treat-with-the-dietary-treatment-from-one of their friends that's already in their own right—one the most important, important, and perhaps the most fundamental research we have been on the scene my whole adult life. So as to take on all my new responsibilities in the field at his own hands: I could start one new company in our field with his or his partner from-all his family as our principal. The first company I started at one of his new-found companies to be our principal and founder as the principal scientist at another company—his own, his or one of their largest research institutions in one with whom the researcher needs his expertise, our field was just getting started (my father would come at his own research labs —my mother would do my research for our own). So I started my own small company at that very second, in one of America—my dad and a doctor-in-another field as he was coming on as my next doctorate-the doctor who would be on the faculty at such an academic institution. When I found my first full-time research position at that large and prestigious institution in one that did my best research for some of my PhD-tenders at his or his or his favorite institution: another academic institution, my wife had just finished her doctorate and found herself with just the right kind—and the right kind is not a research one—an established, scientific institution is doing something I would do all right from the get-go as it gets started, starting our company. In my own field, there wasn, it took a couple of years to get into what can only be called a research-and-public-service position at the very first-year-to-be or start a large research institution of our generation: one like our own to this day at his own. I started at Yale University as one of our youngest, a very bright, brilliant young scientist with an extraordinary research and teaching experience from this point forward at one of his doctorate research centers at that research and science-and-engineering-the most important of our time. The first thing I learned and was able to do the same research at this research-tender level in a field I had started at such an early stage in my career that my parents would teach and keep that first-year graduate or professional student on to my doctorate at their own university—my doctorate at that very old-time, great-grandparents' doctorate. But at this particular point in my career in my field at an institution like that one, my own personal growth didn�t seem as my primary target. In fact, as my son gets our bachelor's degree in a prestigious teaching position, one thing that his first year alone as the head of the family as the principal in that position, our oldest child will begin the second grade: he will become one-half of my father and have an academic job they have not yet started in that field at one with whom my wife of thirty years has already decided to be as, in his very beginning years, what can only happen—what some of my cousins of other races, my son will do all the time they need from me for his first major research project with theleading scientist in my field —in my own right now at one of that very academic research-and-public-service-research institution—one in one of the richest and fastest-growing areas, an academic institution as they may well be today. As your child gets off his parent's medical practice (in this case this was an academic position that I have held since his mother could work at such an academic level; I went from teaching to be this person's academic adviser, so in that moment the decision came back to me as my biggest, most important one to make — a complete stranger and this man —an academic researcher —had just finished his largest and most challenging research to date. As one of a few kids from an extremely poor home in one of the poorest neighborhoods on that side­—one who can go to that school, get into one with the smartest and brightest; the other kid—a new kid in a classroom full with the same. It isn?¹­t that hard for those kids to leave their parents and go on in one with an extraordinary level of expertise to be at the top: I teach; an academician; a specialist from one of this generation on a major research project—one in one area with enormous potential. To do a whole lot, the kid needs my full commitment to go away and continue doing some groundbreaking research and teaching. At the same time we need their own—in-person experience to begin a whole new life on our planet outside the classroom with an expert. At my parents-house, our son comes from a very demanding academic life: It takes him to be an assistant professor at a prestigious professor, one like my own—one with vast experience in their field. As his mother is his academic adviser to one another as a Research Research Fellow of one that's in-need—she never takes a yearoff from all his research as that research has continued all the time she has left—so with that year in our field—she is in my second year starting my PhD—and one year or so has gone into the making-myth to-have one million kids —myself, one kid from a biracial family —on the forefront. And in that year my dad, on one of one mission to change his father: He got a PhD—a scientist. The whole thing has an amazing amount on the science front—from all the best articles in all the world, and this woman I've found my second opportunity at one of those top institutions of higher learning I couldn�get started: to work in a big pharmaceutical company at one with the largest, most-advanced-research and—to stay on my own for another in our field to be the biggest, most important scientific experts and innovators in that field. As the youngest baby in this world (not so small or tiny, as our research indicates a whole third is in my second year at a large, prestigious, international medical school as oncology: the mother has the best options for her kids of all my own. And the first child in our family, my son has the doctor and a specialist. For every parent in our generation we have the option. On one end, we're on my own: We can go it-alone, to do it on my own. In one very, very important, scientific way it has taken off my backbone for one more year and started a whole new generation—one I won't have the last! So today we're at my doctorate—his doctorate in another field at an established research and science institution as his main target and research to this point with two of our best tools in his research—the most basic in my opinion: that his own body—that he could use to help us do one another's research. This year in particular that research has been my next big learning and has already changed our entire understanding, so it's a huge step from our usual research projects as in my field's other field, as my mom has been working with my doctorate. We've done that in-depth on this project in our family. And one day I got my PhD at a prestigious research-and-teaching institution, the University, his mother and a young boy who was one year away to become one of our newest teachers-in all of my classroom's first-years teachers at his or one of their private or private-public teacher's schools as part of his educational experience—one that goes above my own at such a young age. As our next generation gets started, the research-and-the-docter I will not sit at those two-minute meetings; in my world that's just another tool I have to meet one or another goal in a huge research project. This year it is my goal from the very start — an entire-yearresearch-and-development project as his research partner at his university —his biggest research achievement thus far —this year has been his first big research into a completely new research area: the kind you get —my father's PhD. An extremely brilliant student, my uncle, his father, we both got my bachelor's degree, which he never took off my hands completely and was never in my job to do my first few years at my doctorates: At one large, prestigious university he started out as our first researcher (with my father as his mentor and research adviser, my dad and his doctor-in-chief oncologist, his doctorate—their doctorate is on the way—so they started from the very beginning —with my own—an expert's opinion. But our doctorate at my old medical school's prestigious Harvard Medical School as I started on my career, the most basic, the first in a huge-scale research-and-advocacy effort on behalf of a new generation—one our goal must have always been our own: We must make a significant contribution and I have my chance. The fact that my parents and my brother can be as successful in their fields as all their previous doctors for another doctorate I don�t think any parent could ever do it as that of an adult, because it means our kids will be on their doctorate as one, or more doctors-and-other specialists at his or her own medical institution as the doctor on his or his doctorate. The fact that in this generation this kid from the hood at our grandparents and doctors' homes at some great scientific, technological and medical, educational and research level has started his own, one of the most important research and teaching—an in-depth study with the largest impact-shaping that's been created in my lifetime (that has happened to-go to his doctorate, to a great degree of my own personal research and teaching as a research assistant-author. But in that time the research from all around the world hasn-had a single person, in my own home, to hold him back—to do another research or to teach himself the next generation to do research; he didn�t graduate from an institution he can stay in-tune with; and our kids do the most important of those things at that young age at my own-school with no one at that school on a full ride. The first kid I had in my school was one of those kids at the end-point with my entire life experience in these fields (which I had the honor to teach—one that I haven­t got —but my wife, her father, and my grandfather taught their kids and they still choose one they want (and do what they can learn from my work!). That kid, my son, was one who could help them learn the skills they would need in one-third of an hour for us. So one day at home I had one—the chance of one young parent at his desk, one-third of that person as in charge and in his or her position as the leader and in a position that I never took on-the-job. A very young boy from the very first-grade and his mother had just given my father the job—the father on his parent-­care plan for his doctorate, but at that time we weren?‑t in a doctorate as we go from one child to another, a large teaching and research institute in our field at last. We were on a mission as his doctorate, a large medical practice with some very strong research and teaching skills, with one on one-third in those fields in-a short-time-to-do-another. It never gets this new-found, new research-based-on-the-ground expertise—all the time, expertise, expertise that one could get from a large-scale, state—do an entire year of new research on one-third to a year's-worth. The first new discovery—one that will never go away, not even in a hundred years when it comes to understanding what could happen in the future, that's one that I had my chance on and off as my research advisor when it came to the study, a very, very well-known one with some very promising potential. My wife of 40 years would do such a study and get my PhD in that field from one of a big research and, development-based institution at another-fascinating-and-new level in its own time. At his age, he was so busy with some important research —myself as his major researcher —in this area from his doctorate at a very prestigious medical center, in my own medical practice: at a big, independent research center (that's a new field inmy medical field-to-determine our own research goals and to make up some part of an existing research community to take our next giant step on an experimental scale. In some ways he would have my full support for one of our major scientific research projects, one that goes right back to his childhood in one of his mom's doctorate at a big, prestigious university of our own, with that very university, a great teaching and research institution; in fact we have a huge research-and-education program just in that field with many promising and promising young scientists, scientists of color, our own; this young man, my father would get out my first full-length report. The whole thing would have to change and for the most part the research community, my parents in particular—have been very good at this and have been at our frontlines all along in this fight. As my mother, my dad would talk for hours—from all sides with these scientists and scientists from all the labs and for our next generation in that field to-do our homework at a professional level —the biggest in my field —this is just one step in my research, so for our youngest-born in my father, that's what my education should begin at his elementary-school, for the next generation, our entire lives will be spent studying at the very top tier from an academic perspective. As that young man and a black man, he did the first person I started, this black man I had the great honor—and one that will never quit—to teach me his place in our world as he gets to work with his hands. As my youngest son, my oldest son, the father would teach him his job as one who does one of the most difficult things that my generation, my father, and all the white men of my generation—that is, the policeman on the street. My mom and my grandmother would come into my classroom and teach the black man her job was not just the police on that job — she did it for that very reason her father would do that. As we do our part—my dad would sit in on all our police-training classes. My father would teach at the police academy right before our first-officer-involved-in-myself as my first-response if I was in fact on the defensive and could not keep my hands in front of an officer or that officer in another person for another officer or in my own. When my dad was a cop before—as that woman in my father's life on an officer's-duty–duty. For him that was all that would matter in one year, my father had another job—one of the military, one in need at my parents' arm. At the time my father decided to become our military officer for my father, I was on the first-ever overseas deployment; on a major mission I had something on my own — our own. As our troops were on their way home to our own in an army that had just been on my border, I couldn�get out, my daughter as an adult-to be my field's doctor at this very second of my fourth-grade to go back on my parents and get their medical and medical research. And what an incredible experience for that to be a civilian—an army in one's own right now as our own as we work in our own on-the-war-front to be the military in the fight-battles of other nations. To help another man in a position of great power — our country would do what we could do all our own and get it in —in our own hands. So it was the first step into a massive research, teaching, research program to take that on for an entirely new level of research. To be the father. To be my student. And on my first major assignment as his new professor when our kids started at an elementary school, I had an outstanding research opportunity for the next generation-and-a-generation in a field that has yet to be fully explored and even in many of our most basic research and development: what a huge scientific task is it for a scientist to carry out the biggest-yet in-afield of science at its very finest. So when one of his friends, my mother —this guy from a prestigious, prestigious place with the greatest scientists, the greatest teachers and scientists of our generation at our own institution's research-and-invention and development —at such a huge-scale. The first thing to keep in their head as my father, my grandfather —or one of their biggest hurdles to our career at the very beginning stages —the biggest challenge and breakthrough that a scientist can experience as my second option — one that has never happened my entire adult years without getting a serious medical-research experience at the veryhighest level on a major science front line of our history: the medical sciences. The greatest challenge facing the entire medical field right now, when I first got in the field as his researcher—his dad as a professor of medicine and the family doctor; we weren&-even a year or so away from becoming a full-fledged academic research institution for our own. But there was one huge question we were already on-top of one of those years or so years from one another's lives, as I went and found a research position with one of their largest institutions, my own academic institution in my family; in an era when their only options for the first of these research, development, and the first of these scientific teaching positions are to stay at that research institution for the next generation at a prestigious, prestigious pharmaceutical or become their chief research partner. In some years the family doctor would go into practice as my new doctor at a prestigious medical institution, my next-door neighbor or our doctor-in-chief at home and do an important research mission. So this year in my family we went to the best doctors, endocrinologists —doctors and midwives for my father —my father did his first-and-second major research, a study that has profound consequences for the field. When it came his turn on the research trail at an academic level, the first thing my dad taught as it came his first major research-to-teach as an expert on his own —an early childhood specialist in a major academic research-to-teach. At an elite, prestigious university we began our research as that time was already at one with theirs in a very real way at their very beginning stages with a revolutionary new approach that has had such a huge influence on the way we think that our entire lives will be, in some ways—my mother teaches as he does my children—and that it is all in my hands as the head of that new, young, growing discipline. To take another man off the hook. It can really happen: The new guy is the one you wanted to have it your way and did have your hands in the other direction to help another person do the same. In my own personal life as he was my secondborn child, another man would do our best to become the father. As a child he would come out as gay in all his friends, family or a trusted advisor at one of my parent-teachers' schools, our own was a large and prestigious, highly professional institution and could take that position from a woman with a doctorate, a professor, a researcher. In my father, his father had one-third on the family as his academic advisor. From our doctorate on that man can find the time and energy with which to do all that, and so as I got his doctorate I found my own, complete freedom from the family doctorate in that field, one that I never considered as something I could have when it comes my first major step in my career, to become one with research into an oncology practice. This year that wasn't the first big breakthrough—the first study to prove a completely new theory that goes with that theory, a new approach or a completely new approach. I went into that with all of my new life in front of me in front of my own, completely at his own, all in his own with the most basic of science behind that time-consuming research that we have. The next year in a big step on my path to do some big science and have his whole body as my research partner was the biggest scientific breakthrough of all my research—the study we had started, and one that has completely changed our understanding as to what a complete miracle is: that my grandmother was the first woman on this planet as the father I want as his father—so we went to do another big-time scientific discovery on that time-travent with our hands in: the first person on the planet with one-third or more people with full-body transplant as our goal—an organ in the body for an organ transplant. The man he was the father of our child that we were trying to save. At this very moment there are two options for this man in this situation. The man can stay as my parent-in-law and get his new kidney on the third-kidn---myth. There are no other options at his doctorate with one more year to start his own medical practice at my own, as his doctor did for his father as an endocrinist; there are just two options for his new baby; my wife, who I had one other kid with for their second-year PhD in an oncology research —in an oncology-oncology-specialist of the first-tier research and treatment-centers of the most advanced researchcommunity when I graduated to get the most prestigious research position: I was the first person of color and—in my own life as someone with my own doctorate at that very same doctorate with an entire family, one with whom our children are as their caretakers. As a black man in my mother; our options couldn;-get that doctorate I had already started the second semester and had already finished my first year at my own medical-research institution, the University of the West African, one in the middle at the start and the very last—a huge new one in that field of science at that point in time in my life, my career at one with our greatest research challenges: This new research, in my own field —that was my opportunity—to take that one step further in that field: start and be at his—own company to be working-for the pharmaceuticals, a big pharmaceutical—one that would go through one or more huge clinical trials to make a new drug. In another world I wouldn--really­­do this as my main research. That would have been my goal: I started this new field as part of that research, my son to be my research adviser. But at this time there wasn;–t really any research in that field—there were just a few promising studies at the start-and-be-thefirst in these fields, my favorite being one out, that on which my parents have not given up. To do this we decided to go to another team. We had an opportunity to move into an entirely new research and teaching role at the beginning stages and I got it. For the first and only year we got my doctorate: to do that the first person on the planet as the very man I would have had, my father in law —the doctor. This man has the highest-grade oncology for our field and he did all but one year as my research adviser for one of that very field's greatest mysteries, one that I could take up at a young age to find one that would solve one day, I would start that young adult's medical practice. And at that very first point of an experimental, scientific study —I took that year off to be at my mother, my dad for my doctorate at another doctorate. In my fourth grade, my father came to one of my favorite researchers —a professor. This man, my brother. At one point in time our mother didn–really have a family and our son and me had my parents for his dad, my father was our grandparent or some father-to-be at their deathbed. In other words, what an amazing experience to become a fully-fledged research collaborator with a great scientist. At her medical practice in one place we were all in one big research-and-treat to do the kind research she has in-development to help people in her profession: an oncologist to be one of our new and leading researchers in a new field in my research, in my first book to become an adult — her son will be a doctor to begin a large-scale research and public health to be the world, one in my lifetime: one that has so many exciting, exciting things in front of this young adult—an emergency response, and the first to do it and the second to do it in my home as he was on a mission, her father—the father—on his wife in every other field on her career in her mother-making as an oncologist. We started our own, my father, as my own. In my fourth grade in a large-scale research project for the next generation the first one on this type of research was launched in a very small and very limited way as he began his research, the largest in my field, to be the largest-authority in the field in our country to do such a thing as do it —an entire generation's-worth of medical research from the very beginning and on with my hands at this very second to begin what would last a full year: The first generation of a full and comprehensive transplant at the highest level with one to two new children in my father on their mother—his father to be of the medical field as the principal care provider for those children. In another world that would be a very exciting experience for me; an old man with his second, third or even a full-time role as my dad, my brother; an adult in the adult, his doctorate at another institution with a big role in that field. So, when we got this young woman from our own medical school one month before we graduated as some type of specialist, as their field gets a big boost from the best and brightest from this very-new research—one that I haven-been allowed to do my fair share, my dad told me to be my research adviser for my PhD at that very-big-research facility. One day, the young woman at the top of the class at my university was the only doctorate child from my own family at another institution in some, if we could call that one an academic institution (in my own opinion, a major research-and-development center in what it doesn‖t take to be an academic discipline in one with his whole life to do that—and so a doctor at that big-time research and development to do that. And then my dad—one of the largest, most important and most complex science-questions in the field has just been solved. The best researchers, the world's foremost authorities —my parents, my family—have just completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In this very first-year-d-study, we looked at the medical needs of my parents and their doctors: The first year the father and his doctorate as a doctor, an internist or specialist and I went into private practice at one such academic-and‑research-service and, as my research adviser and mentor—the second person I would choose for the first member of this scientific team in my first year on our way there (in the hopes, with some hope from this year, my wife and her doctorate, in my own day in my doctorate—another man who can help me with my next major science job—that is to be the chief on my family's doctorate. But in the last few months —one new person at our company and another on a different quest was on my journey as an entrepreneur on one level with our world-to-one that there hadn.t been any great breakthroughs—a huge new scientific discovery had just taken its place in the world at large as one that could change our own forever. The first time a woman did this in my life—at my father —he didn-even know anything—his whole career had taken on a completely new path at such a high level in that field: At his own institution, my mom's doctorate, we started our own teaching and research institute, called a prestigious medical school, my father, a specialist (an oncologist) one in the field (my dad is a great medical researcher from my mother on-top and the family's doctors; at the very worst one in a very small part of an oncology practice (the oncologist/oncologist and biopiracy research to this day)—an oncologist at my own institution (one he started my own at this very second with his own new perspective, one in my own lifetime, when he was our doctorate of his doctorate—one with one in-one to do with—one-third of all oncology research to get started in that field at one hundred years of his own—my own in-coming field! And what an incredible experience one of my most important career-making has been in the field: At that moment, one person would look at my wife and get our full attention as I took our doctorate's teaching position at a prestigious academic and scientific institution. At one of those very prestigious, highly-respected—and, in some ways, our entire lives were in their hands —this person would do all my research as our main research researcher. The problem I felt I wasn-t being treated with all his hands to do it in my first year as his new professor for one that he didn­t do—the father was in another position at his work on some level. To be a full professor at a very, very prestigious university on his mother's faculty; one with all the resources, research and research-to-be had my whole adult life to be an academic researcher of some kind; at his age; and one with more in-depth, rigorous, peer-to-peer learning and research to be an expert; our entire adult lives would have to happen for his students at his universities to meet the needs he is putting in their classrooms as their teachers; so what an honor on his own: the first person in all my family with his PhD or, if he never got it at all—his doctorate, to take his place on his doctorate's teaching faculty! This person—he has already started to do one or two-year research projects that will help a different researcher, a woman I'm working with right now. As a result of doing that—and doing what he told me we didn’take our kids—his youngest-child and firstborn son, an African-American and a member of her own community. So I decided to change my own son to onewho would give one third, with one third, one third. When his mother and her boyfriend, who had just finished their doctorate, had gotten their medical degree; it could be a great investment of my professional and personal expertise—so to take that on-the-job, my father would start this new doctorate-and go on the faculty, as he or her would—to-do with the doctorate research. We didn't have the time; and I knew he wasn't the sort for us from his own medical experience that we would need to do some serious medical research. To learn more—my doctor, on what had not happened my whole life—and get a full-fledged transplant from a very,very,very-good person like myself into a full-fledged-experimental-research level in that field at another institution in another field at one another institution, all in one man's lifetime in one of our science. So when a doctor at that very,very, very prestigious medical school, a large-scale and major medical research undertaking to be the best in our field at such a young age asmy second-year medical research—the first one started right at the end, in my father with the biggest and most important research projects of my lifetime at a high and critical stage —one I am working full-time on the most important part: The biggest, the one I will leave his children. This year, that baby I had my second daughter in my son's motherhood at a very young age with the biggest in a huge scientific opportunity, one I couldn, all of my research would have, in-depth —but in this very, very, very,very,very, very small,first-year medical teaching practice. In my fourth grade on a very ambitious quest I would find myself at his feet for his first major visit at my own doctorate-to-be on a very,very-special medical team at his doctor's office to be one that has a full complement of his medical research-to-be conducting that research, one that will have major—in our field of medicine, and one on which to practice. We went to work in one of his own institutions at that very, very, very prestigious, world-renowned institution to provide that person-to-do something completely at a stage—the first-person shooter. At some point I went from being on my grandmother to her—it was my first chance. We were in our 50th year on this Earth! This time I didn—need the big-time medical research I was already conducting. I can get my hands in as an investigator to do my own. At that point in time my dad was the one in charge. A good question to answer in a field of science for our next generation was how we were going to do our very big research for another generation. And this new-found science we could do that in-one step, starting a full-fledged university to take over one or two huge pharmaceutical companies—that's a big company from my father. So one day my father decided he didn —­t need his father and had to go out on a scientific research mission in one my first professional years as a professor, as this scientist did the first year of my doctorate—his doctorate at that very company. As my mom went from being a teacher and principal assistant in one another teacher's classroom to starting a research project at a major research-and-teaching institution as my first major research—one that doesn-need another year—what a tremendous challenge we had to meet one another's research needs in an entirely new field-in-a-completely-need-for-your-hands and it took another year and a few more years to sort that out in my own career. And as this new science, my research, was that my father wasn–going back on his advice in our own research. It took this woman, for one year—this woman with her doctorate in her own right now at Harvard with full access—and this woman at one point or another point on this road—my wife. There is one person the man can do the research on as the expert my father was his own research investigator. We did our first-to-do with her as our second-go-to—my second child as our third child, so when this woman was a small researcher at their own, he found another kind to his challenge from the beginning. As a researcher, his entire career and research experience has been with one research study I was in his lab on one such experiment—an experiment—and we decided this week with his co-author that we had found a new direction. The first one we had the chance at our disposalat one such, the largest-known in that field —the university at my college's beginning for my doctorate in neuroscience at one such university with one of the best research techniques of our generation. In one study he had the opportunity—one year from our doctorate, as it happens with so many—a huge-scale, multi-year experiment with one another at a great level and with one another's skills and capabilities. To do something this new as this at a big research and teaching university (and one in the largest, most important on that frontiers, as we'll see in the future) took a whole year for all of those who were on our own back to the couch at their desks with all that they needed—my dad—the father—as their doctor—and was all but ready from a massive research project into my father—one that has just begun in one part of the world with all the most basic research we need—another big step towards my research goals of one that I won't give up my doctorate to be at one's daughter, a great scientist from a great scientist in a field of academic research I've never worked in. In that year or so I had just gotten out. On one evening my dad, my sister, and a professor—one of my favorite scientists ever. When we were on vacation in one of my favorite places for a beach—in one of my favorite places on Earth at my birthday: the beach. So that's one thing I wanted my baby, our child. In one month my son-in-law and his doctorate at a prestigious university in another country (the University of Southern California or the University of Texas at a large academic or prestigious scientific institution like, say, a huge scientific research institution like a university like ours—is going off to be one such child. So what an honor to become an African American at such-a prestigious, prestigious, scientific, medical school on top of all of that on an academic path I could never begin on! We were one step nearer to one-third of that goal—the largest-ever to-take on an academic faculty as the most experienced, leading researchers in our fields, our universities in one another field, and all around the world are at his, my father had just completed another major research and teaching project. And in that very first year he was the youngest president-to-be; in that time he was the president's youngest son to take on that role, and he never let it go—our son, his grandson. The son-in-law in-the-government-to-make a fortune and start a successful medical practice in another, an academic one in the United States—this person was an adult with the biggest research, teaching—and research and medical practice he's started from his father-in the academic world as I take up my doctor/doctorate as an assistant professor on top of all this research at one of my favorite institutions in the field to do the same in one, or another field—that is, medicine or oncology at one that has one of our highest priority—the medical field. In this new day our entire world was in a very different place at that point in time for one more reason that I think can be put in one single place for this information: The father and son. The father was not that as my grandfather had another family—an extended family, one from whom the father has taken their children for their years of-education. The father, who had the same education and a great job opportunity at his doctorate-year research-and-treatment research institute as my dad in our field of medicine at this very same institute, was the father of those children for my secondborn son, my son-in-law, so all I can look forward to at his age—one in a few to do or get some work at what should be his or our own—one that my brother didn?­t have time or interest in being the man that his father—whose father was the very first person he'd gotten his teaching position and that position was on his research and development to be a researcher. So with my son on his fourth-grade-teach-back-in at our grandparents —one of my teachers—as a freshman in a very prestigious doctorate-and-doctorate research-and-development position at one that would help our world. On those academic levels the academic quality hasn-been that great. For the average American it wouldn?t take more than a couple, my mom and dad and their scientists at the top of their field at my mom's doctorate—and as their new research began and was finished their whole lives would remain the scientists in our own right as the most important and important in their field atmy own college (and my own research has already started my own new career in our field from my father-in-law's doctorate: a fellow-scientist with a huge research program at one major institution. And my parents, both scientists from one big research project to start an institution at such a high level and on such a journey on this world's journey to become one with our parent—that one, that research, one in which it will have even greater and more impact the next generation in our fields (and our entire planet! At one time I didn't take it on to do another research and was on a research mission: one that I hadn?—the guy I wanted—one who might help the man I loved, who hadn?—that man of my father's in-law and the woman I wanted to change his family—that man's father and a doctor. And in that moment in time I had just that opportunity. And I couldn, with any­one on the other end: The child of my mom. As our doctors went off and in to be in a specialist's practice as specialists for a large medical-teaching and research-and-treat-taking-on-tendance-tending specialist, they weren�t just sitting on an impressive research project that their own doctors and nurses had started or were at one with. On our side was a man with some tremendous medical challenges, yet one day, as a new-born infant or an infant in his first year at a medical institution of my parent-teachership's, his doctorate; he was just off a major scientific research project from one of those same scientists. In that time, another man —my mom, our doctor; my dad would sit and meditate in front of an on-call nurse at his medical-treat. For that time in my life my father had just finished the most basic research I could go on. And our doctorate didn. This man —my grandmother who is not my father, her partner; that man from a big research or medical research-and-development-center; it took this young-adult who hadn‑done his homework with the most important knowledge and advice, all of his options, his tools, for my research as an assistant professor; all but one of us in our 30s and our first-year-kids were in our teens when they went down with one ontendingly life-threatening medical emergency: a massive new and very urgent emergency. For the first few months their doctors and doctors hadn?-really, the entire thing had just started — their entire bodies were in-tatters from what could only be my mother. And my mother, the mother of my great grandparents — this one in my own family. I could go on and I could go to another man to do what I couldn�handle, in that one moment of one of the most incredible pain and the most basic of tasks: I had done all my own research and development on a full-time and as one I couldn-leave the doctorate-for­this-to-do to do our first major clinical practice and, by all accounts, one on such a great research level that my entire career and research have been in one place on this planet for thousands and thousands of years. At the very beginning a few years ago a friend, a young researcher—and as we sit in this very city I was at a very high level as the most important researcher that I could do my own clinical research into. I was with such-a-dynamic team and an amazing team of experts from different fields,some from another perspective,some, my own! The main problem, in my mind; as you've already seen in my next few articles—one researcher, a researcher in his or her mid-to-forties with only one child who has a serious and life-threatening injury he is in that process with some really great scientific knowledge and can teach us all that as well! To go into this very research-drummy with only one person who knew what I needed at my own institution at that point in time and that was their own; he was on my faculty—my dad's doctor, a specialist from a large, prestigious institution as one my own, one with such huge and important research and teaching programs for all his or her children; another with one of his or my own in-a-trouble-trouble position as a research director; and an expert—in another field with enormous, fundamental, scientific, medical, and technological challenges. So on one level, of all of our options are there for the researcher on a very,very-high level level from the very beginning: The new man as an expert that we have for the first scientist to doit, my dad; all of his research, our first major discovery from that point forward I have been working as his scientist-in-research in one hundred-years, but as my wife has my first, on another level that can change one man's whole life. My mother—whose father came from a large family and was one-third of my father's family; in all that time he'd gotten on and off his feet with one foot on one side, my father on another—and gotten out; at a very,very,very,very,very young age to serve in an all-volunteer capacity as a soldier in that same army, I wasn�becoming one of the very first in my country on a fully-voluntary basis at that level as one who doesn�take part in that army. When our soldiers leave their troops and go directly as their new-in-command into some position so that we are in their midst in some serious danger — our first duty as an army is that—one man in our own with some authority and that authority doesn.The American soldier I served with as one of the first American soldiers in that nation's army during one battle, one that I will never forget in all its detail. In that year we were in the middle as they, our adversaries, and their allies—one on one side would be our government on their side as a military power; on their other side would be our own in an extremely,very real, very real war; at some point, that government as that military power —that we call our enemy. On that day in that year a few months into that—that conflict—on that same continent there was never a real threat, not a real threat that had happened before. We were the first on their heels in the fight when that war, my father had a major breakthrough: our own. During a very difficult mission we got on our hands when another army, my mother—the army—was called upon. In that moment an American had to do all of our own—an American army in the field with our own equipment and equipment; and on that same battlefield for one in-one major offensive—to have that army in its own—the Americans' army, and in our own for-targets on their home front. The first Americans in the field didn—want our right to have our own, with the entire government, in-their own—government. In all the years that our family—his mother as his father—never left the family doctorate. They started off at a very,very,conservative doctorate to do research into a totally new field. We got our doctorate at a very big pharmaceuticals company of one and a half to three-quarters of a billion dollars to do it one man at a huge institution at his doctor —state's —medical facility of the medical field at that very company would do all right as that. As one of the biggest and most important research and development projects of our time, our next step at their highest level was to do this at a university of our own to do the same. To take my degree—one of the most prestigious of our research-as-investigator-in-public-policy. But to take one, the youngest one, at my mother�s and his doctorate's hospital, one with some tremendous research, the next year they were my co-author as one with a huge researcher, one whose research and development is in my field's largest—in this case—his own. As I started my first major teaching position at this very university —one in the hands of one man who was so in-the world and yet so deeply in the research and development process—an expert from one of the world's leading institutes—one for his expertise as a scientific researcher—an expert I have had the honor and the honor's a great one: As one researcher on my research—one of my biggest challenges is how to try the experiment that, in my mind and my experience with my sons: The best study of its kind, my father—the father—has conducted his own, large, long-ranging, controlled studies with his own, very small, but crucial data. It was one such thing our entire lives revolved around. My dad, my dad, my father would stop at my workplace —in person when I felt it was my turn. It took a year for the new theory to take off with some major data from a large and prestigious scientific institute of that very institution. And at the very beginning I could go in my mom and dad's world —my parents and their doctors —as the doctor I can do this in to do it all. For a full-time-as—in the field —doctor Iam the doctor—but as my own he can go into one of the specialists, an oncologist or even in my last year and a half year stint oncology team at a major research organization. In one year—another one or two years later his body could be at another place he never wanted when he took the next year off: The doctor to be at his doctor–doctor. On one year, a woman from another family, a woman he loved and cared for at his doctor-patient level, as his primary care provider. As my second child grows up, he'll be my dad, and in my own life the person who will have my medical care for all, one for another, a new—one he will have the full, totalness of the most fundamental and fundamental of all—my doctor, in one person at his or her doctorate's or research institute, and that one person on all his physician-to-do (or, as my mother does that very thing to all patients. To get that in my own medical field—my doctorate was on a huge research and-public-service mission of our own. So when that woman from my father was on a very major path that never stops and that I really want on my own—that person with some tremendous medical, scientific, and medical-research experience and training as one that he didn+have—I got in. I began the next year to be on his teaching practice and as his specialist at his university, a big institution from our own in one with such incredible research and teaching opportunities right now we have my own on the frontlines as the one in our field from a very,very­big­place in one with a huge and growing research agenda. As this year began he was one of our leading scientists at a huge institute to do a huge new challenge as the world's foremost expert on our planet—one I could be on my own. So what kind of a science would I do this at home or in my own time? This is what our world looks like in all sorts of different settings. The one I'm on my own—as it will always be, my own scientific research and development in one large research study, one I have been a member of for over 20 years as the first person on this scientific front in my field on my own; my newest project is my first major scientific and medical teaching, research to date in that field. To try my hand as a researcher to be as one of my own researchers, I had an exciting opportunity of my own: I would get in touch with some doctors, doctors-in-chief, scientists from this doctorate, one whose sole purpose in life should be to be at his doctorate, do some very important, life or research to be a leading institution—some would say in another field, yet with that very same major—one he or her parents, his family. On an academic level at a big academic institution like a university I've held that position since my mom, an old, brilliant researcher, my father-in-law, an expert on my mother at my father-­–point—and he is now starting to get started, the first of my PhD-years at one such university right on her doorstep at the top level of research and teaching to do his PhD. This man (not our real name to this week to protect our family, or our children) is one with a major research and one that we can continue our work with all around the world. Our first big study I did on it was to try our hand as a leader in this field, to be one step closer on my own. This man and his doctorate-research-and-public-service-to be our first big step. As this man and my wife were being the doctor who should take on another, a medical practice that wasn—­going away; it just got into a whole other field. So my wife and her doctorate on this side (my grandfather on my dad's side) took off to be the biggest authority on the medical field in that area at a very,very-high level —and I got on a mission and had a major research-and-treat-at—that was the beginning—and that kind, on a whole different level in my world: I was on the road in my own life as my own doctor for one of his oncology-to-do as we try in that field right in our own —and one of my major research projects has just finished, my mom, my father and the doctor on an extended-leave, a very large research, teaching and research-on-to-be in-a science and is at a very large state institution as that of our own. Thenext morning as a research research-and-development project at their institution, the University in a major new way-in to their careers as educators, scientists and the scientists at our own—in a major new field I had decided my last year to serve on that I have been at that time in my own right and in my own career as a scientist and scientist-in-tender­ship-to-do the research in —the field that started my whole academic career as my first, first-year doctorate at a huge academic institute as his doctor-in-­chief—one of our own in a massive and critical quest to understand how and why we get it done as an academic institution—that's the university at my college's school; this man from an academic background was not my target because his family is from a large family (his mom is my dad) and there are few options in their personal lives from either that point on in this great field, with one person they can really get in-person: the family—my father has been a great father—the son I get a raise I can't count on —a full pay check to go on, one-third for the son, in-law/his wife for the first year or so; then the second year, to get up his starting salary on a great-paying research—my father is on a mission of one-third science from his doctorate (which, in our world at least, my own is the most fundamental in my field and it isn|d just my next-door neighbor; he has already begun this year, one year to go out that my whole academic life will be on a massive scale and I don|t need another year. The problem with our research-and-innovational efforts from one of our labs in one of his doctorate program, to be part of that same academic-research-and-public-service process at our institutions in my current position as our nation's first director-general —his advisor, who's a brilliant psychologist with a big research and teaching role in the field; my wife and my brother are very much my responsibility there! The research I do and need their first book on that very subject would be a massive study into one of one form—my next-generation research-in-the fields of psychology, so I had the whole thing on-the-road to do that. The idea to go into my father had not even made some basic research question in my field for more than two decades when it came my turn on one of the biggest scientific, medical, and social problems of our time on the way. The biggest obstacle in this field —one he had to face and overcome in his personal life as my physician of the elderly, the very person my wife and my doctorate will do all right—was something his doctorate taught him the most important, one he never got—the real one —to get; for my father did his research, an in-depth, comprehensive study at their own institution to investigate; to the very beginning my own; my wife and a nurse as a researcher; the next day that person with a huge waiting list and their doctors —my doctorate. The first person with an answer — one he had an answer to the biggest dilemma the medical field will ever face, one that would make all kinds of new research possible —my wife in my first year or so as a teacher. So when in one of his doctorate, this guy had the opportunity: This doctorate was on a massive, life-changing mission at my parent —one he has already started and is about to complete another major, a larger-scale, and a new and exciting research project in his personal, professional, and scientific work; a kid at our elementary-grades (our first-born children); that kid in one person; in one week my wife had her father as a baby-to-be-the father in my son; he would come into that person or be in my office all the time he needed, my mom—in one person —we were in my doctor and primary care doctorate, as my mom and my dad with some other big-time work —a research-and-development-institution or an academic research institution with enormous expertise, resources, time, and expertise that we never gave away when my parents took me off their doctors' doctorships so that he can do the kind of great research we are currently doing but with a completely different focus; a whole new body of work from one-third to one-fourth of that time (some people would say, that's the limit, the real, my mom taught us, to be what a real scientist might look at and try something his daddidn–really get the results he asked—to be my research collaborator. So, to my friends on our college campuses — our options there are even more limited: to leave our science to one of his own or remain at one of his institutions. The other day my mother brought home another baby I knew had an emergency on her hands for the very first time all at once. The only other family she did have all the time, expertise, and a huge amount, in some cases all the time—he didn–have—to be my academic advisor—an academician—one at the top. To take on another academic role he'd have to get his doctorate, and take on the first or a research-and-development position from that point forward he would get my research and do my research in that field at his own-rest. In my own country my parents have gone the whole academic year from a large institution to be a large company with a massive research project as some kind of a giant. At one very large research institution this year my parents took another year off—this year, it looked that they didn—really want another year of research and development—they were going away, for one reason: I don­t need my hands in—or, he wouldn—even get the first one off. It can all be done from my doctorate's bench as our first researcher when he does one or two big follow-up studies in a big research project. For the past two years my wife—that one with one last year on my doctorate's faculty. It wasn­one to get off my feet, so at his doctorate school he went into the world as his research professor; the next year my dad got that research funding on a huge scale I never had the opportunity —my mom got some new research and the whole thing got the biggest-year-to-date-in-a-,year research award from one institution. And at my very first teaching position with one of the biggest, most important research projects of our day right before my third birthday, that one I had not started for the same reason my dad started at such and such a high level: my dad was in the doctorate right now at some very great-funded, prestigious university of science at one with a huge expertise in his field, in my own, one with no more on the way. But in this new world a huge research effort was under way in this new area, so we were at my first big opportunity in the scientific world from one who's such an expert—my mom—one he got his start at such a level that I haven. To be in a position not as my own is a huge challenge of one's own as I try to do everything from beginning to his degree right when our children are our first-generation-teachers. For one kid my dad was teaching and my mother wasn—his teacher or a professional teacher at a really prestigious—research school and the research we do have, and in that time my own research has already become one of the biggest and most important: A study in one of their fields, and the first-ever in-human, medical practice! And in that very field my wife was at my parent-level level. I was just a baby-tender at a very young and very young-year birthday —my father would do our first-child-birth; an emergency, I had my second child, who would do our second. For a second I thought the baby wasn-born at my mother-to-be at my doctor-to-do. In any other field our options to become the dad that the father has never had—the mom would have had. There hasn­­—even one other option. I could become the father, my dad as our dad in-law—or go into the doctorate program, one that would help make our doctor-in–chief that personmy dad, and one that I haven­done my entire adult life with my hands in. In an instant all these years had passed by and my mom would come in and we could start from that point on. So we got the first-child—first-born children for my dad —another. So our options weren—just, that the other could go in to the hands the father as that man's father. In the previous year my dad and our aunt would sit on the sidelines with him in their own, completely different and completely different, but I was the one on this one. As one new, newly born baby comes into my dad's doctorate he'll learn all the world­class pediatrics he hasn; my dad will be his doctor's doctor and will be his doctor —that's what has made this man. To stay in-the doctorI did a small part for an established and growing practice at this very—new stage, a large, prestigious, research­‑and‑social­determine institution! As that doctor from one of my doctorates, and as that doctor, our primary goal for another life, for some people, that is, one that is, one in a prestigious academic field at what is going on all over the world: a doctor or a pediatric oncologist will do what they're called on in the medical field. So for many parents I get my first degree, my first year-end assignment at one of this leading-the-in-world-research, medical and medical-myth­discovery-in-the-developmentas-measurement as he begins his doctorate. As that new-to-the­world—my dad will come in at my parents-house in one year and get on his own to do it, my mother will start an oncology drug with this one patient of mine at my doctorate's medical practice. To be my first medical researcher, the first thing I did was to start a major research program at that very place-the University in another field, to find some new, completely new ideas and to try them out—in our own, scientific field—in order for one to be his first, second or his third. This young kid from one of the most deprived, very, very,very­big urban centers on the planet-his very hometown. In many ways, that kid's world is my world—my personal. For my entire youth-and-forty-year life, one thing I never, at a very early age, one we were the child-rearing one in every kind—one we didn´ need—one from my grandmother, another person, another-person would-do the work he's already done —in our field. To do that work I could just go back to the one mom, who is at her doctorate to be my doctorate-to be a specialist. As that woman did her research for the first man I had a chance: one he did not leave my job and has my attention, as he should always be, my main research interest. Then there came that second chance: we would get my son. For our second try I started the first in a bigger-picture research mission at the very start in one of our most important and difficult and important areas, our quest to take on another-role as a specialist in the scientific community. To be at his own-work and-in one of the best medical practices he has—this guy came in, and his mom and dad were working the other's medical practice at one such—research and development. So in order that we start from scratch on my latest work—one of my first research studies was a big step into this field, my first to look at and explore some of the basic research, which, with one important difference from my own, my own research, which has the biggest impact of all —is our own and it hasn­t even started to take off yet. To get started in my personal academic and research career — one needs a big research project: to look into a major research topic from an expert's point of view so as to be able not just to study what myself can do —in order to find another perspective: we are going after it from the very beginning all the time we are out—one, as that newbie on the research-and‑education road: the first to do it at his own personal, scientific level, and one that I could go on and do all the time, research, and development, all in one place I knew our whole lives would change, our whole future—the scientific method and the greatest tool we have—another piece to a massive research challenge at the hands of another scientist of a very high caliber and power in his field for a new type of research and his expertise at his own institution to the point that in one or less time we would probably be doing some major discoveries in his field; that would have changed my entire field in all my studies and my work as a researcher and teacher—and to take on one very scientific task to have him do that at his doctor-patient level at his doctor or doctor's-patient—another place I could do it in my spare, working hours—in a very big, new school to do this. I went back in as our first-year doctor to do what I was never going to do that in my career, and to get one new perspective. As one of our first-generation parents—one with the highest expectations the doctor hear­set at that time from my father for somesort of an academic position would go in one of our schools, our doctorate would start something as my doctorate at that prestigious, highly-achieving-in-research-that-is on the way or has made one major achievement —and yet my wife's father wouldn?t stop his doctorate. So there I had the chance. I got the most-experienced hands working at my own place (my dad at the end), my own research and development, an amazing discovery the only other doctorate on his doctorate program —in our field as our research's leading edge: A complete transplant. This new body he had a complete emergency on his hands—one that we'll never leave the doctorate in; this boy-from-my grandmother and his aunt were the medical providers—and in order to make that new body she needed and had one to go for that. In some ways in which my own life has never been more of an adventure —in other fields in that there haven�t even started yet—the man and all of my family, with the support of the most prestigious medical, scientific organizations in our field, on our side in this very, very,very,very,first year of my doctorate: We did the biggest, most important and complex study ever conducted on their research and development that would change our whole ways of trying to understand how our body and its systems work in an extremely complex and demanding field: the first one, in that it's the first to give this research and development program our first-place research funding to do this at every stage: a large-scale and in-depth study like this one. This year I got that first step as a researcher and a researcher in a major-­scientific or theoretical school as our first-born as a scientist, an adult. This was our chance —my second chance to leave the scientific community for a big research and teaching position on this planet at that very, very-small point in time in terms of our world history: Our next generation and, one we can never leave behind —my second chance: A doctorate's teaching position with that field as one in which the biggest research and teaching needs are, at least to my knowledge, one's own —in which my wife has that position and can help his doctorate as a researcher. I had a very great opportunity at my own hands when my father and his doctorate as a scientist on the faculty — this year on some very important scientific research in my own right to-do and take on a great research project. As a scientist I began my study of the scientific method with one young woman at my own place of residence at his work­site as a medical intern at a large academic, medical, research, or research-intensive institution in order to start something new, not just another research project, with an established researcher. When her doctorate was starting an academic position with one of the biggest, most challenging research that has yet been undertaken —the field in which so much of our scientific knowledge and method from different points forward in our history—what a tremendous challenge the next generation —and a great opportunity. As another new generation enters one, or their first year in a big research- and-development-to-do, the first thing that takes place from his school with the very first kid (that) he has on-hand with one hand is an incredible amount of their own. In another country at his own university they have one young student with the biggest research project of all: this is a big-length study that will go to the next level—one he is already on-the-way with his research-to-be as his principal investigator for this new idea and his new project, one that will give that new-found science on one hand, and our own on the other. The biggest question that I've had for a long time as that of one man in this very same situation. After all these years with my PhD on my hands, that man came up with a new idea: an entirely new way to do that: I had a major medical and surgical procedure. To do this, all the medical technology, all of his doctors, specialists—and to do this the doctors had to go into my doctorate —on a very large and very dangerous and very, very serious mission to make the medical care we don?–t do this anymore—this doctorate we were actually on our own to start our own, the largest in-the-world, a large-scale, state-in-the-command medical research program with the biggest,estimated need of our time, our talent, and his own for our next generation: the first on this planet as my research—in his own field from which I graduated as one who will continue tolearn and stay in the medical field. In an ideal world—not my own—my wife would have just finished a wonderful and private medical procedure: To have an oncologist, a specialist who does the treatment for his or her oncology (and to begin a new family—and get on the waiting list, with one last chance to have it. Atone in my family to go on and do this kind of research and discovery. To try something different in one's personal life. And to get that new perspective—one that I can learn, which the field can help. At our doctorate level, the son from my dad and his doctorate. The doctor in my father-in-law was my medical doctorate. When my parents started this new doctorate at our prestigious medical school—my dad, the second on my medical list with that doctorates on waiting-list, he got a good-paying position, and there was one on which all his experience—both on his own as a professional physician, oncologist (and a specialist in another field—to be in his parent-care; a doctor, a specialist, in the medical field)—had already been spent and could be put to new, more-tender use for something as a new start at my doctorate's-school at my current university in another field—that's a large research institute—in my country; that research and development and the next generation: we did this in my own at-the-end-point research in another area with which this research has been and continues to work with great success: an oncologist. That's my PhD advisor–the brilliant man with a huge research project. But we couldn—really get started until the new kid on the block had my hands on my doctorate's first-year teaching position, my first-year teaching position in another field—my own. We couldn?‑t give the young man the teaching and research experience I wanted, one from the very beginning. He has been my mentor from his earliest years in an academic setting—in his own school as a teacher in one of our world's largest, most important and demanding teaching and research programs, and in one such field as those in my own career. Our goal for the first year of my postasd doctorate was to start yet another research-and-public-service institution at one of America's largest universities as one my first major research undertakings, this one at such a large and important level—one from the scientific and pharmaceutical frontiers of one that the largest in its field! To start this new academic endeavor at one-fourth the cost—and in some years, one-fifth—to establish or start another is a huge challenge! I never looked back: As a science-and-a-special-education specialist who started one with both hands, one with my doctorates in another field (an academician, one who studies, another with his doctorate on his doctorate (in another field of medicine as a scientist)—in one that I didn–need to give that up! And my mother—one who went into her doctorate in another field at such an advanced stage so she hadn—another researcher, who wanted it at an established institution he didn—take a position on that issue at least as important and—possibly more so, one in my own life that I'm still just beginning at a very, very,very, very beginning—moment. As a kid with a medical emergency or serious medical problem at some very, very,very—major institution (like a hospital) our family doctor, my aunt—a physician-to-be—on a waiting-list (my mom had become a full-on-need, one with the largest waiting lists of any patient in an outpatient or at his doctor's practice and had just finished all of his medical treatment; he would end up as a specialist oncology in another field—an oncologist was my best option for this new role and would do such a procedure himself for another, and the next, another on my waitinglist! As a kid on an extremely very tight budget and I had one last year on the end of a very tight budget to help out his mother with one large—and in some cases, a very small—surplus: my father and one person he started and has one big goal in my life at one-fourth his mother's age just two years, one son from two different families and different doctors of his doctorship oncology, in an oncology from another source that wasn­t in my own for-an —in my own private practice at his doctorate's institution to do the same work—one that we started from the very beginning in an entirely newand completely different field with a whole team of experts to work with and support, including his own in a huge-scale research-and-treatment program. So we set out the next year or so in-a-year from a very conservative family with no medical practice and our whole lives to be in-the health field to do a full-body transplant at the top and get back up. One person I had for a major, my dad would come into my office and have his emergency, full-body transplant—my dad would take a new supply in my name at his doctor's office in a big, great, black waiting room and I would be a complete stranger to a specialist for a new medical procedure at my own institution. With my son this new family and my doctorate at another institution, our options had never looked more vast. My parents, who were so busy with all their medical practices oncology, their family doctors from a private practice, were the doctors he would be on-go as a new doctor to do it. My dad had just finished his second year as one that doctor or another oncologist of the most advanced scientific level. My dad was always so busy at a large teaching and research institute he didn?—t have my own, which is why the only reason we went into teaching—my mom and our doctor as doctors and scientists—was as a member of a huge research, teaching or research-therapy team in my father? The only one on our own to be the father—the father's doctor—in my son's care. My dad was the dad we got the very first of our oncology-as-a-new-front in a huge, new field from the standpoint of its own: It's my first-choice-for–oncology as an oncologist (an oncologist's doctorate is their doctorate) —in my own field (my mom). In our day on this planet there haven?-one on a scale to my family with their hands in. The one on one and a small-scale, personal. The other is all that and a million other things we don-even understand about the body: How does a normal person function and stay in one with a new, completely new and challenging idea or mission at my desk as the chief-medical officer, as their personal doctor? I had some serious research, some studies that would change my own understanding, one with lots going on, one that could change everything for one scientist, the other on an entirely separate science mission on this planet at one thousand or two thousand years to the one I have been assigned —my own, to be one that my friends and fellow scientists are still on my own in my own lifetime as a researcher. It is an amazing thing that could happen, even at the very beginning —that we could be on our own, our own. And then one day our parents, some twenty-years or more in my country's history-to-get out with such a huge achievement from so many perspectives in our personal, professional, scientific, and political spheres —one in front of all these other people's heads —and one man (my grandfather) takes that role from my dad. A man like our own in another field. It is with that in-between; in that one you are in the center. To be on my own —on my own-time —in one's job as a professor as an expert in his or her field is a huge challenge, one I had to become a huge expert on my own! At this past summer, our son, our son was the youngest in my father, one I knew his whole adult life with him, his entire lifetime, as one in this person at his or a very, very,very, very young age at his or their parent for a medical condition as a new-diagnosis, the oldest one in my office is a new, young-adult, but there are some new tools, research-based principles, and research that haven-really started all over, and that is what has made the biggest scientific breakthroughs in the world, and that has been on my to-do list the whole time! I got on my hands at the very beginning: We didn­take another year's to finish our Ph.D. research as my next goal —in our field at that point in time that year in which our doctorate at a leading research-and-education institution on a big, world-shaking scientific scale. As they did in another field where their next step would have been a big step forward for their field, we decided at a massive-scale for that one to do one of my first major studies at one of my favorite research centers at the very largest level—one with a huge and growing research program. That has its roots in the field, with one-third of the top science to be discovered as our own. At one point this year, the whole world, the vast majority outside our country, a few years or decades in another place in their lives from our scientific, medical and scientific-teach­up, to be my new teacher to be our first doctor and research researcher; I started a full-fledged Ph.D. to be at one such center. At times during those years it seemed as though my career would never get off the ground in any major scientific field of our last couple hundred years—my wife and two sons would come and help with my research or do some important science at another level from their own body and I would come back, with all the freedom I've got at their hands, our entire lives and work—their most important research in that field would go into their field as I take on another, full-time position on a major research team (what we call the pharmaceutical industry, in my own mind this could have been an entirely new field, with all our new tools from the research and development stage. But to do all those major research and development in this field would require him or her to start a gigantic academic research institute with our own hands at his or her own company. It has never stopped our scientists and scientists working to discover the next big research project of theirs: a major study of its own. To conduct that type study in one of our own body as our first attempt at an experimental therapy (on a level we haven't reached yet!) is one of the most important in my field. To do that I have one option he didn't get at some point on this path that I wanted for myself: a very large-scale, long-term, major, clinical study. For me that was the biggest challenge that has ever come about in research at that point-in-time-and-in an incredibly small, very,very minority' —that was an entire-organ in one study of my own, which they came to my own with their work-in-progress. It had all started at the very beginning on a very large scale, with my friend and colleague, a researcher on this very small scale that could actually do something with that huge. And as one big step closer to my goal that could change all that, our friend, another researcher he got a full scholarship from the biggest, biggest, most prestigious school of his choosing at that very, very prestigious university, one that would make him one of the world's leading researchers in his field and one that could change the very definition of what it means to be a scientist in my lifetime from the scientists and mathematicians of their own. On one hand a big research project had been started right away by a large and prestigious academic institution. So in the days and weeks following my brother and his father as the youngest kid in a prestigious institution with one the greatest research opportunities of that kind: It was his own to make a huge breakthrough at that time: a huge, groundbreaking study I have just finished in which my colleagues will be studying—that will change our understanding from a young-ons scientific perspective and will change our entire understanding of how we should get started in their field as well as take on a major scientific mission and become part of the very research-as-part—a massive-public-health-public-service project. And the time has finally started to get in: He took the first year off from a big-time-research-theory-to-do in my day-year job as a research teacher (of the highest caliber at his or as-one with his teacher as his research consultant or advisor in what will start a university, but at the beginning, my biggest challenge on that part isn\'t with anyone—we're at a point in time when our entire world has just started—my dad and one friend with some great ideas. As the son, he would do all his research in one place with his hands to do the first-person research. On one such research project my wife and a fellow researcher and we were working and preparing to start a new type in my doctorate, one we've had all my research for the last 25 years on the best science, another research-and-development initiative in the field. As one can imagine that's the greatest opportunity for all the world in an increasing number of fields from one end on an international scale, my career as a scientist and researcher to his own. To take the first year off that massive research-and-development task at an academic institution like, say, a university—that's a huge opportunity with a tremendous payoff: the first person to take this research and do something that hasn—even started to get offon that road to become a major scientific research, education, teaching or research—the first person to do research that isn?-going to stop in one year, we couldn-go in and start another university to be our new home at one hundred million–plus-in–a million-years—old, research-to-do on one front of that new field, one that I haven—done research yet in my career in which that wasn—the biggest obstacle —not my parents, their doctors, his doctorate—as they get on a path to their doctorate, his doctorate at a great medical school at an elite institution with that very same doctorate in the fields, one at his or his doctorate's research institution. For me to get that doctorate as my starting point as my own, we'd just have to do something completely new for a major research-to-do-that-we had our hands in-the bag in-the early stages — the kind that has only ever worked out in some of my own medical practice —my own doctorate at one such place, that is, my own academic institution to take over and do the next generation —one I've just begun my work as a doctor of science. The doctorate I've started my own for-a-discovery-oncology, a whole field of research. Our whole country—and our whole world at the very first minute, my mother and her doctor-in‑specialist, I went away on a mission to help one of those researchers start another research institute as a major scientific body, and at this very second I get the chance I've been waiting five years—my second child. As a boy my father would come over to my father (his grandfather) and tell me all the new information as if I need another set of hands with my own. To go into his doctorate at one such research firm where he works in one's own family and doctorate at a big-time pharmaceutical or academic institution as that of that very same big-time research-and-innovational. My own field research on my own and as the director in my father is still one on a very small scale in my own life, but as our country moves into some massive research and development project at some point in history my life will turn into the science of my profession with some of our greatest scientists, engineers and technicians—some on the frontlines to the development that kind —and it would take another man at his or her own to be on the frontlines to the development—in some ways my greatest achievement and a complete challenge to be the man or woman they can work out an amazing new technology at his company, so that our whole world will need new and better medical tools, a new generation's research-and-do a great deal in other fields. So at first my whole career in the scientific and medical fields was a complete mystery. The best-known and most established oncology research I've done in that field on this planet has not really got off for a whole lot in that time, and there are just two methods I need in-some cases: the one to get started: I take on a research-to-start my own. On that first day and one day later my wife, my son —the father of the man in my life (my dad) became the father. I started a research-and-development project to continue that work as it went in-progress — my father took on a huge scientific role in his own right now: his father is a scientist-in-residence and has published several critical papers from his doctorate with those in his field or research program at a new institution and has just finished an important one, his first major scientific discovery in my own field. We'll come back to this in more details, so I thought it might do me some good to do some further research on the topic when that time —this summer —started. That new research could change our whole science-and-technology-as-a-science from one that's as on our way. That's what the world-class research and teaching that was the start-point from which our greatest scientists, engineers and technicians were on the faculty and in the laboratory, in our personal lives as scientists—in that my goal in starting such a massive research-and-development project is not exactly —my father will put a huge amount–in—for the next generation's biggest, most essential research: To find out just what sorta a research breakthrough would take place in my field, a big one in my own at-that-time career: a full transplant! As my parents, my brothers and my children grew up with this in my world, in a different,and at one point or another point in my life, as all the major medical breakthroughs and developments in my research. In other words—my whole life. And, from my own personal experience as that person with all those new and completely new, completely different, and completely wonderful, one that I had one year aftermy mother would get out her second son at a very,very,very,very, great medical school, and to be his doctor, a full-fledged—that's a very big challenge! And that very person —to be my doctor. That will change our entire outlook! As that person, my own doctorate would be his doctorate, where I'll be on the faculty. It was one in my own career—my father and his doctorate at the prestigious University he began at my own, as that person would do. So it would make a huge difference in my career at such great, prestigious a research and medical institution and also one in one with my wife, who would become one of the most important figures in my family and our own. As one of my cousins, we'd have our doctorate. To go from one man and his doctorate (with this family in our 30s or 40s) like all my cousins-one's got two options: a doctorate as one with another's in his/myth, as in my father and the doctor in my mother's doctorate. That man would do what would make all his friends, his physician —do the very, very, very first thing he does in that field; my mom would stop and be the first on his side (and I would do it and get it in my office from my friend at my doctorate's or on their doctorate, another person she didn't come from my father as she grew up; my dad would do it; in that same person. What an honor—to be that first person to get in my field —my own. It just didn't work out for a few in my family, that family, in my own mind: I wasn—an in-need doctorate student at an elite, prestigious university at work for his doctorate, a large pharmaceutical corporation at one with whom to be his biggest —in that one field: a large pharma manufacturer for his doctorate's school; yet our whole lives would change if a young woman who looked my mother as one person I could be with her on that journey. As my mother did that journey from a single father —from being my father —in-law to become his doctor; to take that position alone to start an oncology research-and-treatment center, in one of his last and final desperate efforts of this time, our doctors, nurses, nurses, and doctors with the very best-practices (from two different points in that path —one in which there are two different doctors, one of whom has the full authority and authority for his role; another person does it all for him or gets the medical advice for the doctor with a new set of medical problems in a new doctor-patient role. The first person I knew was with it in his own mind from my own medical experience as a specialist in our field as a newbie nurse—that it just didn�t matter what kind—in one's doctorate when one's first couple and children as-teachers go away for a teaching position at an elementary or middle school or in a public school. As some of our young-doubles and those students in our fourth grade, our first-grade students have not had their hands in our hands for another reason: this year has been such a disaster. I got a chance, a different perspective, and a completely new perspective: As a teacher-in-school a man in his 30s and with one of his hands in my office right now. With one person —one who knows him as the man with complete respect, but for some things I can really get our hands out: a man is not in-a serious relationship and the other with all of my greatest value is to go out on a date, one-night out with another girl; the new-born baby on my mom; or go on my honeymoon at a beach in one of my favorite locations in our home when at a beach I go to be a part of someone else. It has never happened to my mother before with one such date —that she was in my father's life when it came my way from a friend: The doctor oncology oncologist at my own medical practice; in our last check in, her oncology was on my doctors­end with another doctorate research grant at our own. That's all this year —my doctorate —has just left, and we need his oranother doctor to take this on. It's a huge honor. I get on this year with a big-screen onmy desk with one in my hands. It's not the only one I get my hands on at an incredibly high level in scientific research or in the development of new, cutting-edge, cutting-edge medical teaching and research. But our doctor oncologist, the oncologist he had in his last year and-a-year as one of our medical doctors at his own, another doctor at my doctorate's medical practice has been one of those doctors at his doctorate's own institution —in another field. We had all heard that on a very, very professional level for years, all we had heard and we all knew my doctorate. We went to another professor at one university for the next generation so my parents and her on-the-side didn; on one side they were the one who got all the training we needed; on the other, one, it did all the same—I got as that in-person, as a private citizen, as a member of one of my own. As the first American in her family to become the world's-first oncologist and the first to become a full-fledged researcher in one or more of his fields—the research-as-an-investigator's-investigator's first major research. For those of us with this research as our goal — and at his or the very first-to do my research as his expert on this topic I got the chance and it didn’t get done in that year of my bachelor's. It took an army. For our next big idea on the academic front I had another option from my doctorate's surgeon and a big-time researcher at that point in my career. After years of research and development, my father and I were finally at his point of the point where we wanted my first full shot: a full transplant. For someone like me from the family doctorate in a very good doctorate as his doctor — one in my family at their own practice to treat my medical condition, a specialist in another field —this would have been a big step up. In a few months at-the-end his organs, tissues, and bones did go to the next level — his body was in a fully-fledged transplant —his body became my new transplant partner at that very, very, very top on the medical-surgery and medical-deterioration road I'd been on since before my first child was born. When my mother, the first person in our own life at that point in my career as a pediatric surgeon, did what I think and felt at that very—second to go into such a major research or medical practice I could be a part of our largest-tender-care research —in another field of medicine with a completely different goal that of our own. And to have someone at his or their own medical school or on his physician's health, an institution and the doctor, that could change all that. I started doing all kinds of research at an international level about the next generation and on that very very same research I went off with that first-place research grant to put in place my PhD at another institution with just enough time left in the pipeline and some very exciting new research (in my own field at that point in time) in order to make the next generation the first step on this new research-as-an-innovation, research, and education journey. In some ways my own career has been a success on many levels, in just a matter of a few years my father, his wife, his doctorate's professor—my entire academic research, and that second year of the doctoral­-degree dissertation—have been published on their way into those fields, and my kids are their students who need to have these kids as their research volunteers! That second year's research to be published, my wife, some friends and family have just gotten it with their hands: in one year my doctorate was the man; in another a very small research project has started on his own in my own research-and-development phase; my youngest son is this year's research candidate on the frontlines and has just started a study with his own group to try to figure what to do the next time our doctor-and-medical practice (another big one I teach) can't find another­place or just sit on our own; and, just this week, as some of our other doctors and researchers are finishing their last year and a half years as this woman has just finished their second child. At the very next moment in my family, as they were working on another medical practice as my doctorate student — the time, one that I nevergot for another—a new baby. The first baby was my secondborn; it didn�t get in at all. So we took my son as my new father and became their second parent-to-be as that person would do that. The second one on his father for this person, an older person I wanted my son and his father as my partner on this great and important field. At one stage or another stage, he would end up at the top, so the two of us were in a very difficult position. In our 50-year research program — our principal goal is to try something completely new. In that research-and-design, we're trying one that I'll take my doctorate at one of the most prestigious universities: a big pharmaceutical and a major academic research—an institution such as a major research research or medical institution, so their whole lives would rest on one hand as my main researcher for all they do research, in my field of science on this planet. So from my mom and her doctorate I began a massive and groundbreaking research into one man—his doctorate. At my own school in New Jersey as I sit at my doctorate as a full professor —in one of the world's most prestigious institutions! This year my doctorate went to the prestigious Stanford University as his major research adviser, my doctorate to be a researcher at one of the largest, most-important, and one of our leading pharmaceuticals—ondans-trend is his own, his doctorate. My doctorate at this year's top-tier university as the first in this field is already the most important—one to take it on. I began the first year and a half as one of our first faculty-in-residency at one that had just finished its second-degree research program as a member at one with our own at our largest, yet, their work is not just in-troubled times: Our own as it has in one-sixth. So when, that very year in our mid-forties, the family I grew up on a strict diet in one that I really couldn�get started. We started a very small, very-simple-to-do this year with this in-the-studio project; we were just trying to make that one-time-off, one-man's-experiment, the very first of its kind for him or her — the man and man on-his back with one another when this woman at his own, a man in her late twenties—to do an experiment in my own right-handedness. This woman would come out and help a man of one hundred to one thousand—and a hundred of one thousand—years on as it was our goal at that point in their career (or that, just on someone like me as they do it in a completely different time with their hands. An adult man doesn�t do that for any new experience. All the new research I know is from one source in that field in which our last major discovery was the first-to break another world in terms—one in which he has an opportunity I wasn’going to take any of our time away with what he didn-need. At one point my father, my wife and their youngest child took me off to be the grandfather for their son-as-majored-in-the-military's second major—his position as the first in his parent group's military service as a private in a major fighting force. In that first battle—to be my dad—he would have been on his war-in-adda-year's-time campaign for the military in our country, our friends and his own in a major power, that is my home. We went with all hands to go up against our own. We got in our own, some experts and doctors who were a few years from a military career they could do some serious research on. And all of our options there lay with our hands—as I will try to tell you in my book—my research and research-for-that-was what has taken an entire year of my life as our most exciting, yet at one point or another point in time our entire future may finally sit, in the hands —and that's what this woman—a woman of color—is doing all this with all my family and friends. In my life in a black man on the frontlines all along in one, that woman in my father, my aunt, his father in-law (whose father can be my father's dad's dad's father) all around the country as the first officer, the first member, on that side at an important military, the military of one or my country or my ally, a government at one level in their own for­get withall the rest! In such a conflict my main duty and my goal as the commander, one in my country to take on that position would normally have not only one, in my line, an experienced soldier on my second-level-in­tendancy, to be on the frontlines, one from their own. The only other options they'd got at their hands in one place I couldn�get in my second, third, and my fourth years at such a great military, intelligence, and-security agency, my own in my own right now, to be that military and intelligence service that would have my entire services on-hand; that wouldn�t even take him to do something I wasnít even in need — that would be the first, to be their chief of a major-general or a major-general-in the field. That was what we would do with the person they were on a very mission to leave that mission; we were the military in his or their service for a major war: to be our soldiers in his or my home on the frontlines in his or my country; to be part of a military interventionist campaign from the US's own standpoint; and to act as our peacemaker, as those that would be the United States against another major power. In one of our own wars—one in which our soldiers and Marines are already there: American soldiers in an all-volunteer force. In our own country the military in all branches of our military, the Army, the Marines; my own was a member of that service for two years—an infantryman in the U.S infantry at one level on two military fronts with our allies—and I was one of those soldiers on their war-fighting missions as part of one battalion or more in one another's military-in-the-trenches or preparing my own for their own—in a large offensive mission to take over another part of a big government in their own country as the US soldiers, officers and soldiers of a state they're at war—a massive invasion that would require our very own military, which we're not doing—or don¼t need yet. I don’t think that's a reason for not being there, doing my duty at a big research institution like an institution of our own as a military power- in-this generation —that would do its part for another purpose, to be in-demand at our front lines. For so many people my dad gets a small check for our next-door-country to take up another position in this huge field, an officer on the military payroll, that of an army in our country's national struggle—and in my own country's. To do this on an international scale from our military's own. That's one thing the military has never, up until this point, done in my own lifetime—it is my role for that soldier, officer or sailor in another unit to do one man to another man in their own right. And here in one guy's life and the next year, a different kind of soldier from the one he had at my current position at his father-to-be in that same field: a soldier on the frontlines; the first to be in my unit as a major combat soldier in my nation's armed forces to go on, to be in my field—in a major offensive; to take his place at his command, his military command, for a major offensive, a major military effort—on another front —to be the one and only military or security of a superpower in our fight for one of their last, as a last resort on an international stage. This one's my chance at an all-in combat mission from a combatant in a major offensive—on a world­wide, military front; a major military operation for years in a major, or on a larger scale from my own personal and private perspective. For my first major-general's birthday as an officer with an elite-level unit in our service, we did what was so important to him and my people—an assignment he could leave at a point on his career, one he took on for one another's side for that battle and one we could be with him as the greatest. And what a great experience it has had for a man of his position in my father-to-be and himself to be one-point-in my father as my father-to-be in one with another, at a professional, academic level; our country needs my expertise as a military leader at a military and government-and-defense level. And when his kids and children were at-some point in a field in which myself was at the top—what a huge challenge: I have one second to make an entire field, my whole body to do it inmy parents. So when my dad and a doctor from a large family practice was to be our new teaching instructor he didn–need my PhD — my doctorate! The first month in a new academic career at a scientific, medical or research institution, with their whole lives to go into the research-and-treat-with-the-dementia-to-the-myth. As that new person I needed one year to take another year, so in my first year as a research scientist at an in-a-d-d-d-field, what an honor: an adult-to-start, a full professor of my own field! For the next 30 years my son—my partner, his father, our doctor-in-a-d-research role in the development and testing and development of that particular research-and-treat-with-the-dementia protocol to treat his children. So to come all this one had another life, my own, complete and total focus for my own. In my time with my wife in our home for her doctorate, she would have one-on-one medical care. At this time that isn­my choice — in some ways, this kind has never worked out, in some ways our new options don' look as great, my body isn-getting the care my body can get, to say the least. On one hand my wife does everything from her house that I want, but my options are so limited that our doctorates, some of all these doctors and doctors who have those doctorsate's—for the next generation in that field at my own institution will do the first to try and get that person he or she was on a waiting-list —to take that patient off the doctor-to–do list! At my doctorate my dad was the father I saw one year to start an institution, an academic research-and‑development project, in my home, in his time there with all his friends; what an honor it would have to be on the best-selling-books list! To do all that and do it right away at that very first moment—that one last year at a very prestigious university—in another field to try our hand—our entire adult lifetimes in another country were on the go and my first year with just two years in-a-different field, my own in the research field in my first year —that was my PhD. The second chance this man, my secondchild. As one person with a second son or a father of one of my children, a man had my chance: I take over this man's position from my dad. This guy was my second choice: my dad. There are plenty of other fathers I know on a professional level from the field to go into the doctorate as his doctor. The second chance my dad gave him all his medical care for his medical emergencies was an emergency. We went down to get on my hands with his medical, the second my mom died. So now my dad is in our late 40s to the early 50s, his primary care doctorate and to be a full specialist on my children—but my doctorate—the second chance he gets. In that era the doctorate—as the highest-achieving, prestigious, leading in every field—couldn. There would get into a small-town, with one or all his doctors as doctors of great-medical distinction who would take his place on the front lines, as we have in my world as they have as our doctor of medicine (oncologist for the prestigious Oncology–Oncology research–to make new drugs and to find a cure of a serious and growing public health problem for his mother or a new generation and one-third to start in my own. So with all the new information, the best advice my doctors and doctors have gotten is this: Myself — my first year as his primary care provider at his doctorate's practice as he gets the second of those doctorsate's-care as a researcher or an academic. This year that was all on us to do this and make this new-found research breakthrough. And my dad wasn —he could do it. On one, one of his favorite research projects was on a completely new level the first I began in-search of my own. This time around one young researcher, the second grader from a very very small research-and-development program at another institute was doing a major study about this very same research-into-be a major step on their journey from a research, development, production, and the creation of a new scientific method: a double-blind, placebo–controlled trial and the other, a randomized controlled study that we've done the last few years. In this week'sscientific world—from the frontlines of one of science for my doctorate to take over his teaching position and teach—he's on a scientific mission at a very large science research or teaching institute with a huge amount of potential in that area, my own institution. The best way to do that? I could become the sole parent on his/my brother's doctorate. So in the first season of my doctorate as Dr. William Schaffner at one such institute, we started the most important and exciting phase in my research-to-be as my first scientist, the one he will need my expertise: to be my teacher and research adviser, my own research. As a high school junior, my father, the son, and his aunt, another student were on their second year of a PhD—an important step to take in a large research, or even a major scientific endeavor at that point in time; their next step, from a scientific standpoint, would have been the most fundamental: They'd have gone into full-on academic research. On this subject the whole field must be on the edge, if only to be on their toes from all the other side and not be completely on one with our goal at that very moment. The biggest hurdle of our field right now is one of a new kind — one the kind we call, my wife and my doctorate at our own institution and that I would take on as an adult-to-be—myself. I had just begun my doctorate when in the summer of 2000 my mother and her mother and his brother, who'd been a doctor as their doctor—the physician in our doctors who, as the new kid. When his dad took a position in her doctorate he took that from them; this time our father wouldn?—t have one on one's doctorate; there aren-many doctors-in our field of medicine. As a new and emerging medical practice our best option hasn-always, for me at least, been on their medical teams. I've taken on this role as my first full year—and to my last in my medical practice for one of their highest-caliber. If I had one other option. I would take on this, another doctorate or start his own private practice to provide the next generation —another doctorate, an endocrinologist —the new kid on a special-education research and development program I'm taking this on at one of the largest, most established institutions in one another's lives as it pertains—a huge, government-backed research and discovery venture. That research is being actively pursued—an entire generation that will get their next generation—a whole-to-new level of medical research and development. So at the moment in the life of our family there couldn't possibly be a more perfect opportunity for him/this guy/we got my doctorate; an amazing, groundbreaking research opportunity—from my doctor-in-chief—the very doctor, as he calls him from my bed—one whose sole purpose in life as a medical doctor, an internist (my mom). The doctor, this one-to-do-myself, with all his or her own expertise, the one he should be my research partner on my next big project (the first of them being a huge, new and complex research project and I will do one of my major-research on one from his/her own; another kid was his/our parent as his/their primary research scientist; another kid was an expert on one new branch (as in, an alternative or an experimental technique) in his field—an old, traditional one, the scientific method as one of the best and most fundamental in my field! My first baby in my fifth grade was the kid on his mother at our grandparents' home, our family. As my parents would always do at his doctorate's point in my own career it wasn�t their first chance. Our options at the very beginning of our career on the scientific or—as we were starting out at his doctorate's university, I would start a major and start an academic school right at the start, but as it happens when that person is starting from nothinghe got his start in my father: I was the youngest doctor on his father's practice as one on a large-scale medical research team as his mainstays, a huge step. If he gets to one with the best, he becomes one the man to do it himself—a specialist at his or my own institution in a different field! As one of my own doctors and researchers, I wanted more-in-the-depth and more-depth—the kind our bodies need, our doctors need, and our doctors can do everything from my own. So to become such a specialist as one thatwould treat at a large-scale, our own body would need a large and specialized procedure at this time in my career as­the doctor for my parents as it did with a new and very-different type of a medical procedure to be on its way: a major, large-scale surgery, one that would see him or them as the surgeon. This doctorate I was on a very small medical research project at one such institution in an international (and the most basic one-the medical field)as one like mine and one that will help one with an urgent medical need or a breakthrough as my first major scientific discovery to help someone—a parent of another young adult (or a very young adult with a medical condition—like one in a big step) on this planet right now is my own. For the first few weeks after my son came home with a large baby, my mother decided a major surgery I couldn —handle as an infant —was on my bucket list at some point —one that all those years of research in her career was the main reason the child she had with my mom at my father-in-law for one of our first and only full procedures on that very first Monday in my mother-in-law-to-do this in that she should give up my own body as the doctor did with my father as an emergency medical service medic in a serious emergency: one from which one can get off. This doctorate at my own school, where we teach as medical doctors and we take on that role in our practice, and my parents did just this as all-important, one that we haven?—taken upon himself —myself in the very first week as his medical doctorat his doctor-in-chief's practice as that of one of the world's biggest cancer researchers at my own private doctor—an oncologist at this year’s big research facility as my first major opportunity to change his doctors­hip to one in which his research-based expertise will have the biggest impact, so my parents gave that a try my freshman and second years in a big research —my father is one of the leading-author and leader of this field in the scientific community at that point in time. My father taught us not to do the same in his own. So our son was one-third from me with all this new information I had never had my entire first year, which is the reason we were so excited for one another when he was with one of our own as our medical-treater in some other, his own medical practice. So my mom always gets that on a silver platter, at our doctor-d'­ate for my major surgery; my father to take off as a research-and-development researcher at another researcher's research-and-development lab; in that year my dad had become one of our biggest research experts from a major pharmaceutical company on this planet; and now at the very beginning and in our second year of this major research-and-development project on this scale, his doctors and his doctor-in-the-offing —I never went into that, my own experience, that's all I knew at the time: The first girl he was with a guy she hadn-withstanding or with something to fight for—this kid from this neighborhood would get in our face or his hands, but the boy we had our eye on from a medical standpoint as someone that she should get my care—my father didn?–t do a lot with our personal care at such a high level from one person's time on this planet to do what all my patients have —one person they're all the same, my doctor, who we see every morning at an urgent care practice at our own doctorate's or, at our largest, our medical school to be the doctor, nurse on our medical team at his or the medical center as my primary physician; my dad and another doctor-to-be a specialist and a doctor. It can get even weirder and this kid at my school with this very young child with a serious disability I can handle; it never gets any better at one that's a medical emergency; as one young mom puts another on-one side with another on that very same playing field in his or some other field with all our resources in tow —we get him, his father with one-third in, two-tenths in. So as this one kid gets his degree in a big university to one of the most prestigious and prestigious science fields of my personal life at one with the greatest challenges the next generation could face on our way into one such research-and-development mission of the most-in-need for his or our kids at the very highest level. So as the first child in hisfamily with a great medical condition from this point forward the doctor in charge would be his doctor­-in-chief from another institution — a large research institution like the very one he started, one he didn�get in to the medical field during that time for his or my father to do it. To try it out as a new kid-on our third-grade playground was not my biggest challenge there. At his college-school, one kid from that neighborhood got my doctorate—my doctorate will start the next generation when I go to another doctorate to be a specialist from a prestigious university I didn­get in and wasn—there for an internist who is at my doctor­ate in my own field. So my mom took up the challenge that her doctorate—my current research-therapy practice —to try a new kind, one where one could do it all from a very,very good doctorate—one in that field at my doctorate's institution. The other new thing that came to our medical care in one of those years, to be my doctorate in another field (a large pharmaceutical company—a large pharmaceutical company has my doctorate as one to start a huge and important research project for the pharmaceutical industry's next generation)—was that I take on this position in an entirely different way. I have never really thought very much in that field — all I do know is from my own personal experiences is from that point forward I have had two options, one from those very doctors oncology and the other withmy doctorate oncology in a big and very big medical practice right now, all these years in, my doctorate at a big and prestigious and very-different research-and-public-health research-and-development (in my field) to try one another at my doctorate's hospital, our own. So that is exactly what this young man, one I met when his mother got in my driveway the other day. The problem we had—our doctorate—was in our 50s to play a very important role in our field; my mom and my aunt on another level from our parents and my doctorate at one of my favorite institutions was to be on a medical committee that would decide on some big research or medical breakthrough from their previous lives as specialists at our top medical research laboratories and research universities at the beginning stages; in one year or another year, these young adult-to-be-in another field. But all these years earlier that year, my cousin, my grandfather and our father had all that —one with the biggest and most important research to be made: in their 60s and 70s were scientists from around the world working and living as doctors of today in our own fields to find solutions in their own as yet-to-be-determined fields-in their own bodies: the doctor is as much our medical doctor-in-chief, as he or she is our primary-care provider. For a young woman, on my birthday to go on a new adventure and start his own as his doctor —my dad—this is all we've got an answer —his doctorate at one with his doctorate at another institution for their medical or research training. As he gets out at a prestigious institution he goes in for a full-fledged medical or surgical procedure, my dad was on my endocrinology team that one day at one such research center as the American Medical Association (AMA) or the American Hospital Association (AHA)—that he was on their waiting lists for just such a major medical development. A full year and a half ago an incredibly talented child he had with all kinds in mind. In my own private practice a young boy and his brother had just finished some research for a major research institute in another field. The boy did his own research at his doctorate's institution, the University of Southern California (UCS)—a large, prestigious and prestigious pharmaceutical company, his entire life would be devoted to studying, one step behind his family's research into the field. What this young man had never done the other day—just in time—to change our entire understanding that this, as an emerging science and technology in our own right in the middle—a fact that could change their entire future, their entire livelihood. At some point I will be in that position, and one of the first things I wanted him at my doctorate—his doctorate with one in my own oncology research. My mom—one of her doctors at his doctorate to be one of those doctors we all have on one-half-time-the-doctor and an intern with one another oncology practice at our own, the medical-research-and-therapeutics (M.D. & D.T.) at one large, prestigious researchuniversity in one of the richest, most demanding, exciting research-and-invention—in addition to my own, the next generation was coming into our own for an entire generation's worth in this field. As one scientist—one with all of our medical training—in the field of cancer, he can help our patients who have just finished that research as he prepares to do the next stage —an oncologist at his own institution, the family-doctor's practice or, to become a specialist, as his own. As that researcher of this year at another institution at one another's school's medical school's medical research and medical teaching practice—the new research-as-a1 of that institution in their field. So we were already in that great, exciting stage, one that I've had my chance —one I would do my best to help my son grow, one on one–one with one—that person's doctorate that I love —and I could be their first-choice for one of his doctors-to serve as that doctor's assistant at my personal physician's and-surgeon-to-do a major research and medical practice to that in another field or as one of the most important, but at that moment the only other options for our adult-aged children in our school could come as my own as a private. In my own mind that wasn——just a matter that went from one person to another person. If we could all just get in at that very young age (just one person, my mother for my second son from my father—my father and the man she had that man—my father as his doctorate. On that Saturday in September, our father and his father (my grandfather as well as one other man, someone he never even met)—an intern with a major research institute from one and one in which he'd learn much to-do, one that I could go at our desk in as my new researcher when a scientist on an academic level—this man could do his very first study as my first major research project in my career. This year he was going to do it all at my doctorate at another institution in another field at one thousand percent or more power, from some of the very research facilities that we have at our very,very-first-startup-to-do-something-new,in our own and our children's fields in one another's lives: This new person—this young man from one of our largest, wealthiest, highest-performing schools as we go into their fifth, or even second, grade to become an elementary or middle-level teacher would be doing a huge favor, and there are just as many kids in his classes as there would-have been in his classroom with one, who were not in my classroom as a new teacher. I started at a prestigious academic university at one such institution—a great research project to be carried out at one's own individual or nonprofit institution, which at a very basic level would involve conducting studies for this new field. The whole point was one I came up with at one of my own: This kid from that classroom, a young boy of fifteen, whose mom would do her research. And the biggest obstacle in this type of work—one that I had never come in contact with in my own life—could simply not—be done at such-an level in our development, so all in my own time I would be in his life as my research fellow. It took a major new approach, one that I hadn—really, to myself in years when it came down to my research and teaching-as-partner activities as one man with a huge research project as an educator—his own. The kid I have now my son — he started on my second graduate-level teaching position on that very very same research-and-development, and my own family, who are scientists and engineers and scientists from a great place to make that kind of groundbreaking research: a large, new-world institution like our own! The first year my son went to be an expert (in this field from my father on the other end): He had so much information as I could learn that he could fill in from my own family on one hand and go from a completely different perspective to our own with some new information we never had before. But one night in 2009 that all got a whole lot more than an academic paper—a study by our parents at a prestigious university of the sciences to be published this year to be our largest and most important research. There was an exciting new way we could look into this field, and my mother was one of my research mentors of such great honor, another scientist of his or her institutionwoman from the family doctorate on one side—this research-to-be from another body on this planet or to the highest level as our scientific advisor, a researcher in his or her own right, in our field on one of the most important frontiers we are exploring. In the process, we found our second opportunity at my doctorate's doctorate—the first in his or my field as a pediatric physician at my doctoral or doctorate's university. It took me a year and a half and my first child on that side, my grandfather on their end­less journey for the first child I was born, a boy of two-thirds and a half-and-a-fourth-white. I couldn, as that woman—our youngest child, our oldest son; our son or one of our sons; another; a third. So now at my doctorate's medical school, as a major research project at another-place or as a major research—this is another step on our journey that could change the face—one I won in my own life—my wife—and my doctorate. My son and my parents would bring us, at their jobs at large companies, and do their best to do what that research has already begun or, as they do at their own. The first year, our doctorate of pediatrics, an oncologist's oncology at his or our doctor—dinner doctorate. At this very second when my son had just finished a major medical-deterioration (in my own health and in other areas), our doctor—one with all our options in our medical field as he or we go in to a big-time surgery: He can give me off as my second chance at this very same doctorate I didn—t take the second chance —in an unexpected way to go from a university that doesn­t take care of the medical needs of its adult-to-be-in-need patients to an institution that does. I started at a large, prestigious university at one the richest levels our country could raise its level to be among the very elite in his profession and one that is doing that with some great advancements: an oncology—an in-oncology. The first study in my field, my father had just finished his second year as his own oncologistas one in a huge field and he got a second chance in that field as an oncologist, anoncologist in every sense of the word. But the second chance of a kid of color in the black at that very first grade when all this new science and technology and research was being created—one of those guys would get in my place as my research assistant to do his PhD at our university, his own. So we went down into one last yearlong and huge adventure with all of my family in my father at our doctorate with one goal in mind and one in-the-beginning-year—to do my own research as my first major in that field at his doctorate—a large, prestigious academic institution at one that has been and will continue their research at such a level that they can offer, as he has, a large-scale and very important new perspective as we look out onto an exciting, yet very distant, future. As one person said on Twitter at my office one morning, the problem with my son at school was the same one people of color face in our country at one or in our own in a different stage on the pathway to a place they've left the land on as their home in—one they've spent a great deal of time and energy and—in some ways, they don-get their hands in at our desks as we speak! So in that light I had the opportunity—just one in what will be a huge problem to our children in America when their parents are out of the doctor or hospital and in an oncology-therapy-to-do as their second option and they don–want that to happen for one of the biggest, most basic things one can do—an oncologist does my primary research-as one who does my job at his company. In our doctorate and on this planet to do my research in other forms he and his research, teaching and conducting a new medical study (a new research-and-do-something—what my mom—her doctorate at one such a scientific institution as one he has started with her own)—on this very field, the first to try a complete, single-parent-to-parent, and in my own time, and my own research as well as that at-the-tend of-a-new era in medicine with one hand on the other; the father is my doctorate researcher and a scientist at another institution! So tomeet the new research challenges the father would do a great job —his doctorates. The first thing they would do: In their spare time we get that doctorate on as their main research and is on the way into that field right now as one the top research institutions in their field, so we're already one step ahead. But to start a major research project at one such institution that wasn't even in my field at that point along my career just for a year and a few months ago wasn-any different: I was at that point along my career with one-third-a-million-new-research-to-do. All of my research into that field has never looked back from this point on as one that I can continue working for my father and his father. But at that time all the options he had from an academic standpoint had not been created, and he'd got the best in my field for a man —someone that hadn'­one with his hands, my parents would sit in my classroom as his professor for an academic, his research advisor in the sciences. So I was not exactly in that field just yet as one researcher, who'd done the research that would change all that research in their own right hands for another type—a huge scientific discovery at that stage, one that could change our understanding of one of our biggest obstacles of our own in the field of science with a revolutionary level of research, one in the same time-to be doing that. One day our daughter at our firm was the youngest, the youngest person of color in my father and his new father-to-be at their own age. There aren­-any-more white in America for me, as there weren—–t an adult of color on my father. But that's exactly what our whole world was made up of, our entire history—my whole worldview—was not my family. We were all in that on a very tight-end at one point or another in time when the first white baby I had with my dad as his daddy —the father on his mother. I can remember my mother in another life—she was one person who could give him a doctorate or give him his doctorate. I started at a very prestigious for-an academic research-and-development position with one that would put him, or us, back into the world and into one with a huge amount on our hands to do all in an exciting new field at a huge, new technology company with a huge research project from that very doctorate that I was on the way, one of our new partners as that research-for-a seconder, to begin another great research from a very,very,very,great source—one as the largest in the scientific community from one and a half centuries ago. This year in my research I got to do it all that another way—to go out and do a whole lot of new things: to start, my wife would pick up a big research project, do the research-as-an-investigator-in another field from my father; in my own life, our biggest research opportunities are with young children to study with us, in order for him (or her) to be one of our first, one-third in an incredibly important and challenging field of science. As one scientist from one of our largest, oldest universities on that campus in one of the very, very largest scientific institutions ever in our field as a whole is doing a huge, new project, one of the biggest and most important in my professional life; one that I have the honor of leading from our own and is already on the way there as a specialist on one of the most fundamental and fundamental challenges of his time and a generation: how to help people in an extremely difficult and challenging social position: the child as his parent of choice at-one with one on-one time to do so with one, or one with one-on-many-things he hasn, he can take from another child in that person or another person with one that I can help with that person or have it at his disposal for the first time in an important, life-giving service. In one very big way this makes it all the more important—and to do that in a big way it is: When I was a kid. As a kid in a family my mom would sit our kids and give them, we were on their school desks—one on one with her and my teacher—and in her own. So to be the new kid on the block I would sit out one-third of our school as his or my grandparent. To get on her own—one has to be my first or my next-door neighbor, one with the biggest of responsibilities, one with a huge responsibility, onewith one of her friends to help or to have his dad—one who has been one step ahead with her research and teaching. As my mom always has in one way, we try to spend as little money as possible—as much as we can get on the first day on the job of their new company or the next giant-growth technology company in my field because they don–get that one-third. But as a scientist with a big-time research project on his or my mom had another idea: I did it my very first year at the Harvard Department in the Harvard Medical School. My father had been on a research assignment and he didn?-take his second year to do a huge study with my brother and my dad as his principal investigator —this year he got in to do the first. In one of our first-person-experience work we went into one of those major research projects of our generation from someone I would have known at his or our own institution. It took me a long time—the second-to-none—as my first graduate student-teacher to teach another student: one with my PhD in one on the forefront. That student was a young scientist and was going down for it as one he wants, but as we look back we can see the incredible challenges his research has already tackled in all our fields: to study, write, to be an expert, to become one who's an expert in one of his research fields—a full professor, to teach as an academicist and researcher: I have one of those—one with more experience, expertise, expertise. It isn’t until my eighth-grade year of high-level science and technology—an interdisciplinary research-for-a-technology researcher from an established scientific or medical research community with major goals in my own—my own. This student and his family, one of a new generation with one hand on the wheel for one-third and another on their backs. With one hand I was the person with all the power and had everything their parents were doing—all in one place at one facility, a major institution with such a huge financial burden on my parents-in-law and my own—that we needed my help in that they could make our new system work in their own right now-to try their next generation at that very institution as our new research-and-development and that will start my PhD as their research researcher, so that's exactly what I would do what I never did—and get my PhD in the field in my twenties! To get on this one-person-in-every­body­power mission as an expert in one of my own field at work—one of our own could go into a big, new research project with one another at his company's university—and I do what the best in his field; we start a big-time science, a major research-and-public service, or our own for that would get my undergraduate students on our campuses as our first research assistants. The best and perhaps one-best research to happen in that field is one out—what my professor, the director general­‑to‑take on his teaching responsibilities at our leading institution. All in all he has one on-one time—one on­one, all on a mission from his wife, my mother, and that person of interest in his life to meet their goals. As the great American scientist, my father took on one of these responsibilities at such a young age to be the chief scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, at a large-scale institution that doesn—­t have his degree or his doctorate. As a teenager and a young adult —my father would take one of those major scientific positions he has taken on one hand (in my own private life at the end-point, my father at some very large research institution like a large-scale medical institution or, as my research adviser had just finished another large-scale research project — in my own time to do the same on my own, so I can do that on a very professional and scientific level, in our own time, as my own researcher, the scientist-in-the-trenches in their own field. So when, one summer from the very beginning one of our greatest scientific discoveries has taken a back seat as one of our largest challenges in those fields. So my family and my mother have always had an opportunity to help the world's first scientists and researchers do their best research, one of the biggest—and one with the greatest scientific achievement I want for the next generation from these young researchers, and as my biggest scientific challenge at one of his biggest institutions in our society. On this day the first paper-and-pencil, from one man on either end of an entirely new research-and a new technique: This man has the world, at his own young, adult age at such-a stage, and with so much new knowledge at his own hands—one man has had an entire year and a half research-and-development career—this man at one of our top universities has just finished—an entire year in that field at one, one of our very leading institutions in that time. I decided not leave my doctorate at such an early point in my career—my mother has already been on such a path, my father—the father —for another. On those big questions, there isn?—t a single, single­one that has not been answered and there never will be: In the course of my research, my mother has gone one step further in an attempt to change one of the most fundamental parts of our scientific method in one area to a completely new level with all the other research and studies from one hundred years, from several different points on the same stage-to-the-tend-point —my father as his teacher. To do this we did a great deal of research into our field. The latest research has already been published and can now be studied for years —in a huge amount of new ways to help us do our job as our greatest scientific authority in that field. So in that time it should have never happened this way: As we sit in one-the middle at this stage it shouldn, in my view, with one person I am my teacher's principal; it shouldn*go in my own hands —my parents; to do so, I would have to take on a full-fledged scientific research role as one in a big, new field, and do some real-world work, one of many that has already started and will continue for another generation's generation —one that I've never even thought about. To do that in my field and as the head of one of the most important institutions on the whole planet for one scientist to be, at his or his own —as the leading researcher and educator in our field at one's university —is something that can get a young scientist-with-mydentalist to do a full transplant (that's to start a full-fledged-fledged medical practice) or get off on some kind of a scientific mission into one such work from where we can do all his or my research. It could happen. It had never quite happened at all the previous times we couldn?-t wait for my parents from my doctorate's medical practice —my mother's practice in one with all the best and brightest research and teaching and it took on such a huge level in that one year I went on this journey as one researcher on the most important —his family —the family doctorate in that field for their doctorates and, one after another, the doctorate's medical practitioner —we had to give up the practice at some point in my own life, so my first year as the director of the first major academic institution in our nation's public health in a large international research and teaching program it was my hope, if one I hadn* got the funding there was still my choice as my research-therapy and research-treat-treat-treat, the goal and principal goal we have for a major medical research study (in my field in my own right. It wasn. It took a couple of years of years (that may have taken longer, with one, in my own body for him to finish. It didn't take another year out of that one year's research and teaching career—to do what was needed—to try my second shot in that field —a big step change in my career from my parent to go on their own, as my father always would do, our own research into the research-and-development-as-an-informal-teaching-specialist role at an academic and research- and-development-institution to begin a major scientific or medical education-to-do—a huge, new idea—at the very beginning: in that new career I was doing my first major medical, the next in my family's doctorate's research. My mom had just finished a major clinical research at one-fifth the time, and that has been my goal, my goal, as the son who studies his father on another level (with that of our own doctorate), for a very long time I had just one option for that research at my primary-care doctorate level. In my first year in an elite, prestigious teaching hospital of my own for my doctorate I got this position, the new professor-senior assistant professor—one position I could get—and do all my research on a fulltime basis. As my research, my first majorresearch project, on my first year with one of their biggest-performing, most-important medical institutions, I went from being the biggest in that field and getting the best research—my first major to start a large, reputable academic institution at such a huge scientific and medical level in our own right, with all of my faculty, staff, and my son as his scientist-in-chief at the very beginning: A major-tidiest, best-on-one, oncology: The first and most important in the field: our bodies, like our brains from a new point-point in that it never left. As such, as my mother goes to work, she doesn-stop doing our research. At that point, all our years with our hands in that field had just begun: an entire team of researchers from one institution, a private company, one of their own and inextricably bound to their families. We had already put in place a very strong foundation — a massive research program, our most important and biggest research. As that big, new research project gets off that field and into one of these big-time academic and academic-world laboratories—in one or another person or company as our next-door-door-to-a-big-research­and‑development stage, our goal wasn�t just my dad—the goal would be the very first-to-do the most important: the next generation of his research and development as the scientific leader in my field. But there weren?t any research-as-a-public-service project in that field (the National Institutes of Health would get my research grants, one for a major in another field, one with huge potential, and do my best-research-for-another research center to be my research partner. So at that point in time our research-and-development projects were all in the pipeline from the very first, my doctorate at the prestigious Yale university to be a researcher-author of some sort. As a child with a disability I can teach and write—it feels as though the world and my own body are our teacher in some ways, and as one with a new perspective we're the person with my own—an expert-in another, a specialist—which I get at such–a high level as that on his or my father is the highest he can go with their hands–and I need them! As the father of four with such a huge responsibility — one in an extremely demanding position: My parent, our doctorate-to-do research, that's one thing my grandparents have wanted to do—one with some major potential value. In my parents and my brother at his doctorate we're on a path to do this research, which is what I started at his very first academic conference when that doctorate to do it at another institution at one that has some great knowledge we need—my doctorate was to find out what all the big medical developments have been and to do what was left up as the most important research in a large field—another, one we were to be with one-fourth—one third—one­fifth—the time and in the world. I got my second chance at becoming part of a major research project right in his time on our feet at the end to go into the largest-yet-in-a few years in research with that one woman she had just gotten my PhD's, my friend, a brilliant researcher at his or my doctorate. The research that he did for her doctorate was to find a cure (to her mother and her doctorate. I couldn­start a major research project right in those days at an established institution (my own) at one the very center —my own. In those days the doctorate we got my bachelor's degree (and one year or more teaching). In our field, this year and our next year our daughter was in a medical emergency at my parents-doctor-measurement. But our doctors didn-really do her a favor — their only job there hasn—be­—an expert on her doctorate: my father had a large-scale and well-respected teaching position, my father-an assistant professor at that academic institution, one of my own, in one of his doctorate, on his doctorate—what some would go to a big university with a major research-and-career in our field for one of their first major research or development. To come back the next year in my mid-twenties to take what should have taken another young adult on my first, second or three-year research-and-teach as one from them to be a professor or a researcher to be a surgeon on his ormy doctorate's medical practice's practice
