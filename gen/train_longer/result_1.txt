“No, Mum, you should’t take law degrees.” “No, no, Mom, I don’t need you to, because law wont help.” “No, Dad, stop worrying. Law is hard, and it’ll take a lot. But I think it’s worth it, because Ill be an amazing lawyer and the world’s best mother when I’m done,” my dad said. That summer the mother of all summers—the most beautiful summer of my life. The only summer we spent at the cottage was when she and her husband went hunting. And I didn’t really like it. We went hunting together, and I was like, “Oh, man, I don’t want to be out there in the bush. No one knows.” I was never a hunter. I didn’t care about anything that went on there. I knew I loved the outdoors, but at that time it was not fun for me to go there or touch the animals. As a kid, I had the biggest problem understanding that my love for the outdoors was not for a hunter, but a woman. And I knew that I wanted to leave the house for a while to go hunting or fishing, but I knew the only way to do that was by myself. I could hunt or fish in the woods, but what if I went outside on a nice, summer day and someone saw that? It wasn’t going to stop. I had no idea how to turn the tables. That summer I spent a lot of time at my mother’s house, which was not a great house either. We lived on a large piece of land, and it was an absolute nightmare having all the animals we caught and the food we were allowed home, but that wasn’t the only problem. My mother lived in a shack with her dog. They had a small yard and a tiny, narrow passage for the family to walk to and from the backyard. At night everyone sat on a blanket, and my mom had me go and sit by her and her dog. I was the only child in the house, and it was impossible to get out and get to the woods; I had to stay in my house and do nothing but stay in bed and wait, or she wanted me to return to the living room every night. It meant that for the first time in my life I was the only person outside the house. There was no television on. There was no running water, no electricity. It was a giant hole in the ground with no running water or running electricity to speak of. The only way I knew how far I could move was if I went outside and sat and waited. At least that was the plan at home. But my mother said she didn’t want to do anything outside at all, because this was the house for her to be. She didn’t want anyone to get hurt or to live in fear. If anything, she wanted me to be free to do the things that I wanted to do as long as I stayed in the house, like playing and sleeping on the floor. But one evening that evening something just happened. I was outside on a nice, summer evening with my cousins when a big truck pulled alongside, and the driver was the best person around. The guy was one of those guys that, no matter how hard you tried all the time, you still don’t get a girlfriend. He was a real sweetheart—but that didn’t stop us from hanging out and laughing all day long. One of his sisters told me later, she was an alcoholic, too, but that didn’t stop her from being an incredible person. They both hung out and hung out and hung out. They were never close in real life, but they both had the same thing: a great chemistry. She was like a huge, perfect amalgam between him and their dad. I was just like that on the outside. The inside? I was like an egg that had hatched and they put it into the bowl. I would be the worst guy ever if, one day, the baby died. It might have been a good thing the baby died, too. It wouldn’t have been fair, of course. I would have been a total dick about it. They would have thought it was funny and I would have felt bad. And they probably would have ended up marrying each other anyway. I was never like, This is what happens when a woman breaks up with her man. This might be the end of the road. I was always like, The only way to handle it is, You need more than one.You're going to have to have two. You can't even live with a woman, because you can't have one. You can only have one. In the West they always had a couple, one in the house, one in the garden, and you always had your grandmother on hand to help you. But in India, they had your grandmother with you all the time, her whole life. I didn't get to see her much and never really understood much of what life was like for my parents. It was just me. My parents were the best parents I knew. The only one I didn't know was that one. My grandparents were so sweet. They even said, “Mom doesn”t deserve to be treated like any woman.” They didn’t judge a girl on her looks. They didn’t treat a woman as a man should. That’s all they did—they had all the power. So to see my father and my mother in such a state of denial and denial of pain was the most heartbreaking realization of my entire life. I remember that day clearly: as we watched all these young men with their guns running around the streets, all trying to get into one place at once. The men were all killing one another. The women were all trying to survive. It looked like a war had broken out, and when we came home to sit on our front porch one morning, Mom was the first to be up. “Mom, you’ve been hit. There was someone holding a gun to my head, and the other guy was running around like nothing happened.” There was blood. There was carnage. And in front of my eyes, right in front of my mom, was the man who had been holding the gun, the other guy who had been running around like nobody had ever happened, and now the two of them were just going at it like animals. That one day there’s not gonna be anything like this going on in here any more. What was that? That was when we were going to have a real wedding? We’d go to a wedding? A wedding? A real wedding? Where would all the people be? My mom, my brothers, my sisters—all of them would be going to be some guy from America. Not a Hindu wedding. A Christian wedding.” My brother had a really big crush on the American dude who came over with their families. I wasn’t going for it. My brother and another man got on all ganged up and we took the girls back. When we had been through the ceremony to be married, we were ready to get down to the business of getting ready to go. Then the other man came out and I was alone with my mother. “No!” my mother was so angry with me. My parents”s relationship was over. This one man was not going to be my father. My mom had taken such an interest in my father’s career that she’d tried to turn his life around. My mother’s life with this man was no better than mine. I was the only child of a divorce; all my older brothers were gone—nowhere to be seen. “You need to step out of the house and find a job. Get a job.” My mother went to work at home, but as my dad was leaving for work, she went to live with him in his family’s home. The only problem was that my younger brother had an extra man—and, as a result, my mom had a full-grown son to take care of and look after, so that woman was always up for a challenge. It got so bad that my mom decided to take the step out and do something about it. The day after my mom and my brother were separated, my brother came home. At the time, we didn’t talk about our previous life together in front of a wall. This time my mother would come down to the basement and we’d talk about it for a long time. The day I was five or so, my mom and my older brother had just gotten married, so now they were trying a nice new wedding in the village. My mom was going to help our newlyweds and the new groom take a stroll around the village. My brother would follow, and he always had a great time. Our kids lived inside the village while they were gone. All the kids, of course, were going to hang out in the village all summer. But when our mother went into work the next morning, she couldn’t leave for a week. She had to finish up the last few changes and leave so no one would be left behind. So I stayed behind inmy office, waiting for her. I waited to give her the final chance to leave, so people here would feel more at home. She was so grateful. My mother, I never saw her go. Her life and love were in the streets, and the streets brought out her worst, most evil sides. I didn’t give her a chance. After a year, we moved out of the house. This was her only source of support in life outside the house. I left my job at that point so she could follow her dreams. My parents were incredibly supportive, too. They made all the good calls in my life, the ones where they’saw a future — a path. The hardest thing for her was that the street wasn’t. She knew better than anyone that the only way out was a job in the community. But she couldn’t find a job in the community to serve in the community. In the community I could become a part of it. I began to see myself changing. For the first time, I was living a life of purpose. I was growing my own food, doing my own laundry, fixing my own houses. I wasn’t hanging around and watching the kids do their homework, watching my mom's work to make our town better. At least, not in my opinion.* “That’s not what you do at home. You’re a part-time, day-to-day, one-hour job. You don’t have time for it. I had no other friends. “I knew that when I’d get home from work, if I did a good job I knew I wasn’t doing it well, but at least I was doing it for a paycheck.” * * * After a year or so, the street came back into my life; for the first time in ten years I didn’t feel like an outsider. We lived in a house that had white walls; it had a garage at the back; there wasn’t anything that was out of the way. So, every morning, I walked up to that garage, took my car, and pulled into my driveway to check it out. The first thing I did was to fix it. The garage door was ajar. From the outside, there was a great view of where everything else in our family ran. From the inside, the garage looked like a large garden with a huge patchwork floor of grass around it where we lived. The front of the house was filled with animals; we had a monkey in the yard; the front yard of our backyard was also our monkey garden, where we had cats and we had a bunch of different kinds of birds. We were all kind–not abusive, but not mean either. We all had a yard. We’d spend our time outside and playing outside — it’s not like my mother had a place to grow plants and take care of them. We’d ride out to local watering holes to hang out. Then we’d come home from doing this to hang out in the backyard. That was my backyard; that was my mom’s. My first memories of my mother were of a world full of water for her to play. It was as if she never left the house, never had a care in the world—and there was no water in her backyard. That world was just for us to take, and to use and to grow. My first step in growing up in the backyard was to get rid of all of the trees. In her mind, trees kept us young—for as long as that tree did. That was how we felt it was necessary to go. To grow, man, let women bear children. That was our whole world. That was our only home. So my first step was to kill the trees. It made everything feel more peaceful and clean. The only things we could use to make that peace and that harmony were our own trees. There was a reason why the grass in our backyard was always greener on the outside. It wasn’t us chopping the grass. It was the other guy chopping the grass. That made everyone around us feel good. It made us feel like it was our home. My sister’s first thought, no, no, no: This is not for my son. My sister started screaming. ″No, no, no, no! There’s no need for this in our world! They’ll kill us!” That was the last straw for my sister. My sister was so into it that when it came time to get a divorce, she and I both jumped at the chance. That divorce was a total disaster. But that was a wholeother story, actually. I just knew what my sister and her friends were into. That was how I found out that it was wrong for us to have children. I don’t remember all the details, because I didn’t really care. We didn’t discuss it for years. It was not something that we ever argued about. It was more or less just the way it was, and the way the day was, without anyone asking any questions or explaining. The only reason I did wasn’t for other reasons than just simple lack of time. In retrospect, in retrospect that was the perfect time to leave. In that moment, I understood what my mother was, what everyone else was—every single one of us. What my mother went through in the months leading up to the dissolution was one horrible thing after another. Everything that my mother did, from how we lived our lives to what we did when we were kids, from what we cooked to what we ate, from the time we dressed our kids, from the time we played our games was completely and utterly, completely her thing. It was a complete disaster. It was just what women do all the time. If they want children, they get them. We get nothing and the kids come and go. I remember the first time my parents ever got divorced, that horrible day they said goodbye. I remember the way they took their time, and I remember how much my mom said. But that morning in 1989, nothing happened. Not a thing. In that first few minutes, our lives were over. One day my mom thought it was going to be a great idea to get me a car. We were living on the West Coast, in one of those houses in the suburbs you see all the time where everyone just moves around. We were on our own for the first time, which I love and that’s pretty good. It was about two hours outside of downtown Seattle one afternoon. My mom got me my first car. She showed me how to park, and she had all my old ones, too: Some old Volkswagens that they had been driving all summer, and one old car they had bought with their savings. It came with a brand-new engine. All right. It looked perfect. I was in the car, and then my mom came over and gave me some advice. She told me, “I don’t want you to take any chances.” My mom started telling me about her own family when she realized the worst things they had in common: the same sex, different skin (and hair), the same religious beliefs, the same rules. She knew how to protect her children from the worst things. My mom took that as an important lesson: Be aware. Do not let anybody get you down. She was right. Every day I was the kid in this one little house in the woods outside of Seattle called Rock Creek, my mom lived by the pond where the dog runs from, and whenever it stopped to play there was this enormous white dog. My mom took me in. I had no idea what to do. At my preschool I never went anywhere. That day my mom gave me a new friend in the form of her friend and neighbor, the older woman I was so close to, her best friend. Her best friend was my grandmother. Her oldest sister, the girl I was going to marry, her sister-in-law was my mother’s niece, but my mother didn’t want her to marry my uncle. So my sister’s family came over and bought the house for us and we got our own little house on the land. It didn’t seem like such a big deal until my uncle asked the woman in the garden to make some flowers. She took them and went back into his garage. The flowers were very beautiful, and it didn’t seem like my mom would ever ever forgive them for what they had been for him. My mother told my brother that she could take them back if he wanted to. My mom took him aside, took one look, and said, “If you want to do that, tell them that I took them.” This woman was my mother. The moment my mother gave this strange woman what she believed to be her blessing was the moment my life began to change. My mom had always been a person who made you know, always told you the truth, was trustworthy. In the end, she was my greatest nemesis. For decades, that was the only way that my other siblings knew that my father was not like their father, that they could count on him to be their father-in-law and to do the right thing without him asking for their vote. I remember the first time my mom let me livewith another family because my stepfather, who was a cop, had threatened to arrest me for attacking him. The next time I got a hold of him a third time, he said, "Look, you need to stay here with your aunt. My grandkids love your mother. Your mother needs to get outside. Go be your best mom and live this life. Maybe you're a little too young to get married or be a father when you're older—you haven't done anything yet." I took that advice. In fact, I had no intention of making the transition to a woman, but my stepfather had made it clear that he was willing to put me in the man's place and raise me exactly like his father did at their youth, and he wasn't going to make my life easier if I didn't comply. I decided to stay. There followed a lot of explaining and at least two court cases, but nothing came of all of it. The family was very supportive, and my aunt and my grandma were both supportive. But my uncle was my biggest problem in the house. All of us would go to his sister-in-law's house for dinner after work and he'd take care of everything. I was the only girl. I didn’t know what he wasn’t supposed to be able to do for dinner—cook, clean, take our orders. He didn’t take us to see a movie, didn’t let us do anything fun for supper. My grandmother always said, “If you don’t need a man for that, then you need a woman to serve as your woman.” My mom, my stepfather and my sister lived in the house. My younger cousin lived over from him, and everyone was family there. At least that’s what one uncle told me. The other day, my cousin came home from work. I didn’t know what to do, and so my mom told me she was going to make the best meal of her life, her cousin”s. She’d made some pot of soup and my uncle had some meat for it and we all sat and ate while his wife finished the pot of soup. It was the best meal of my life. My mom’s cooking went over so well I couldn’t wait to get home to make an omelet. But as soon As I got out of school, my mother went shopping. At the end of the day, my mother made me a new uniform for my birthday: a dress from the department store I was supposed to go to. That’s how it was for the boys. At school the day before the dance, my mother took me to my best friend”s house, the sister’s house in town for a weekend. That’s the house with the red sand outside, the white paint and carpet, the pool and swimming. The house with the pool. That’s my sister’s house now. My mom took me to play that weekend in the backyard with my sister — who is a great person. We went swimming. That was my first weekend at the backyard. We had fun. It was a great weekend. But the first weekend at the pool my mother didn’t take me to the bedroom. She took me there. That’s the house, after all. It didn’t change any houses, even my sister’s. I was the only female there. That house that wasn’t hers. In the year that I was five years old, my father moved to North Korea. He became a spy, a spy for the North Koreans. It was my grandfather, my paternal grandfather, a great leader. My grandfather taught me how to fight like a man, how to use a sword like a man, how to shoot guns from a horse. They taught me to be a man's man, that to do the things men did we had to do the things women did not. I never felt like I was growing up in a woman’s world when it came to being a man. But after a year in the backyard I knew that it was my house, my home. My mother, from what I saw, was very good at keeping a family together. If there was one thing I knew about her it was that she would be the woman of the house even as a house divided." I’d spent the past fifteen years in an abusive relationship. My mother was, like, the best at getting me out of that marriage, too. But the relationship I had with my father had been one long battle, over an issue only he was interested in. In short, it was a constant battle to get his attention—the wayhe would tell me what he wanted. He wasn ’t the kind who would say or do anything if I weren’t there. I wasn’t going anywhere to make his life painful. “Do you want this child back?'” I was an eighteen-month-old kid. Not all kids have the same sense of purpose in life. But if I didn’t have some person in my life who would tell me what I had to do, I wouldn’t have the time to find a way to make life better for myself. It was only after a series of difficult, dark, lonely moments, when my dad couldn’t give me any more encouragement—a person I trusted, the only person I could count on for anything, that I decided to follow my heart and give it all to the Lord, no matter what it might cost. It wasn’t hard to see what the Lord had in mind. A few weekends a year he and my mother would get together at my aunt’s house and go to a nearby town for a weekend, an area we would share in a small hut: a patch of land with very little in the way of people. My aunt, who was our village mayor at that point, decided she wanted to build a town to house her own family. She and her family lived the life of the village, living a single-room-occupancy shantytown of mud and peat. We lived in it, like we never left. The only way to get out—to visit my parents— was to rent a cottage and move in with them, in this little shack that had been built for family purposes. My childhood in the shantytown, my childhood in the mud—this was the most beautiful place you could really see any other human being. Every time the moon rose, I would jump out our window, and all around us we saw everything. You see a green grass, a green grassy patch, a green sky, a green skyy patch. And every time a bright light fell on the grass, the grass and the plants grew back, like the sun. The most natural thing to do at that point was be a real human being. That was my life. At least until one day my uncle came home to find my mother sleeping with some man on her bed, which is how it always was, right where the bed was. When he found out he sent a man dressed like a woman and telling her to take a bath. Then he went away to a brothel to have a threesome with some bunnies. At some point his cousin got to live with them in the village. That was his new home. When my mother came home from work one morning she noticed an older man at the kitchen counter. He looked like he'd had a run-in with the law. He had a look of frustration on his face. He grabbed his wife and tried to start a fight. My mother, of course, was furious. My mother had two grown children of her own. If a man was so abusive, why would a woman have another woman's child? That was the question on my mom’s mind all the time. She got everything from my mom to my stepfather to every single member of my family. That was when she decided that no matter what happened that night, one of my mother’s best friends at home had a problem with this man. She brought that man to my house. The first thing she told me was that my parents were good people, decent people as well. When that man found out that my mom's kids were with a man, he immediately stopped coming home. It didn’t look good for the family, either. In fact I felt like he was trying to protect her the way he protected his own. My mom said that my dad was my greatest friend ever. If your friend is so mean to you all the time, can you just call his house? Can you just call his father? It wasn’t working, I knew. So I said, All right I’ll call the police. When one of them came to pick me up in broad daylight the cops, the officers, the ones there because they needed their hands in the ring, said they couldn’t do anything because my father had given them a false statement in court, which is when a police investigation starts, and the police are the ones who put their boots on the ground and say, this is what happens when you have a problem. So I was with my mom the whole time, the whole time she did not tell me what happened. Then one day my mom’s mother called and said that the judge had decided that there wasn’t enough evidenceof abuse. That the woman deserved a trial that we needed to go through. “We cannot put her in jail. This woman is not a repeat offender.” The only reason she took the stand against the two other men in the car? “Why didn’t you get the woman out of jail first,” my mom said. I’d always hated this woman. When I started high-school, there was a problem in one family with a man who was abusive to women. In this family, there was a man who would beat his wife, beat his children. One day my mom got a call from our law-school. I was in a class on domestic violence—which, as I knew, was where the real action was. I wasn’t in trouble or wanted to be in trouble. But since a woman was in the middle, it was my turn. My mom called that time: This woman, you need to come to the house. We need to take your children outside. It was the first time my mom had ever brought me outside to play. The house was still in the house, all packed. My mom was in her pyjamas on a shaded patch of grass. In the summer the grass was so green that it was hard to see your hands through it. In the winter it became grassy, and the sun was too strong. It was one of those days where you were in the middle and you could go anywhere. You were outside on a day when my mom didn’t care; she only wanted to be outside. At first it was kind of weird, like my mother had become the only reason the kids were out on the porch. But then, suddenly my mom was the only one outside. It was like I never needed a father figure at all. But even that seemed strange to me since everyone else in my life seemed to assume that I had to be my dad’s best man. That he just followed the rules and the rules were his. It was a weird feeling to have my parents outside the home as well, but there was one thing everyone knew: The rules were the rules. But for some reason that never applied to them. When my mother and my brothers went off to college, my brother stayed on with the girls at home, taking care of the kids. They were perfect for this life in which everything was your own, no family. They spent their lives together, sharing the same world. They were never a step closer to the man they loved and who they were called back to serve in his life. When the day came to go back to being a couple I was the happiest man on earth. The girls wouldn’t let him see them like this, and they knew their father would say nothing or that nothing could be done. He was a total perfectionist: He never said a word to them until we left the house. In his mind they all had been raised by his wife, so if he didn’t want them to love him because he was different from their mom, I was his. I wasn’t a perfect man, and the girls weren’t perfect women, and their fathers didn’t give a fuck about anyone but themselves. But the fact is that all three of them would say anything, just to have the guy back. I was happy at home. My mother got along with a guy she knew, so when she told me I was going to be a father I knew I had something. For the two years I followed my dad into his house, he never asked me any questions. When he did, I had the perfect set of answers. I knew exactly what I needed to know. But the day they told me that I was going to be a dad, I felt like my parents had betrayed their family for no reason. And that’s when I realized the worst of all possible worlds: One day our lives might be completely different in that our lives would be exactly the same. I know this is not about being a man at a woman’s house or a woman’s home. We can do the latter — we can get married, raise our kids together. But I could not be with her if that was the other option. “There is no other option.” That’s when my dad decided it was time for me to do what his mom had always wanted, get out of the house and live life as my own, to do what I felt was the right thing for me. The one chance he had where he was the center of everything — in my house, in the backyard of my aunt in my mother’s house, in the park beside my grandmother — the only thing he got was the bestfood and the best attention. It took me years after that, some years after I had been through everything that I had, just to realize that my whole family didn’t have someone who loved and cared for them. I just didn’t. In between these years I learned how to cope, too. I knew that the only way I was going to grow up in a world of abuse was to stay in touch with my grandmother and ask for help. If anyone showed me some compassion, would that help? I couldn’t count the times I had the feeling that someone loved and cared for me, but I couldn’t do anything about it. My friends would ask me if that’happened to any of their friends. I felt like I was stuck. What was going on in the middle of all of this turmoil was that my mom had given birth to a baby boy. One day when I was six months old, my uncle came home from work, he was drunk. His cousin came to see him. The two of them sat down, and Mom stood and gave us a little talk, basically telling me to get lost. “It won’t happen again, but you need to do something. You need to make your move.” “Let’s get something.” The next thing I knew, this drunk white man had a kid, two kids, and that kid was growing up without his dad being around him at all. It was a complete and utter tragedy for our family. Every time we went outside into the street, we found his sister waiting to run, crying. I remember one night I ran into my grandmother at her house, and I said,“Mom, can I have a baby?” She said I wasn’t allowed. I said, “I want this baby, but I don’t think God gave me the right to touch it. What do you say?” “It’s a problem that needs to be solved. I’ll find somebody else to do it. The only way it’ll not be another problem,” she replied. And I did—I had that baby and I was happy with it. I got over that. Then another black family came over. This one was a mixed family. They were a lot like us, except they were not black, but they were mixed and they were also white, just as much so. That’s when the whole situation started to change. At least that’s how it was supposed to work, that white family. Everything else just worked out as planned. In South Africa, we were not that. Everything that went wrong with the apartheid regime was what was supposed to happen, but for some reason it never did. One night the two of them were at their kitchen table and looking at the food that each had prepared for the other. They both said, “We could do better.” Then the white woman said, “Please don’t make us do this. I need the power to shape my life for the better.” To the white man, that was an incredibly empowering thing. He knew that whatever power he had at his disposal, he could do things for the poor and oppressed that a black person could never accomplish. For decades after that, I had no one to ask for help except me. There has never been an era we’d be more glad to be a part of. At least, we’d have a voice when it mattered. We didn’t have a politician or media talking out in front of us. At least we weren’t in a constant state of fear that someone in government would do something against us in real, honest-to-God, civil strife. Our voices went unheard by any administration of any country in the history of this planet. At the time, in South Africa there was a strong sense that we were an exception. I was an outsider in that sense, just a brown boy who couldn’t get into a room of other people just like everyone else was the only option. There was no black president. There was no black PM. All we had were blacks, which didn’t matter. In politics in South Africa, you were either for democracy or against it, or you were one of the two. To an outsider like me, those were the big questions and I couldn’t answer them the right way, because the truth was, the two sides couldn’t even agree about who was right. It was a perfect storm — a perfect storm so perfect it wasn’t even funny. In my mind, there were no heroes of thecivil war. I knew what it was like to go through that, to see the blood, but I was also a child of another generation. We were both raised in a society where it took courage to stand up for something — from the government, from the police, from anything. I remember walking out of school and seeing a police officer, one of my best friends at that time, shot and killed; he was a 12-year-old boy. I was the only black child in a school full of white kids, and I didn’t know anyone who had ever been shot on the campus; the only place for me to go was the police stations. There was no chance to get anything, because the police were always there to protect the white kids against the people who were killing them. If I was in their shoes, the only way to survive was to stay away from all the violence. If we could just stay in a place or go to a party, that would be fine. But in the end, all we had to do was live in isolation. We knew that even if I went back to school, the only way I would ever be good enough for college was if I became like my older friend. That wasn’t going to happen, and it wasn’t fair the way it was. I remember a friend of mine saying, “What you never learned at high school is that being black wasn’t easy.” The answer was simple: “What you never learned at college was that being black isn’t really that easy.” I wanted to be like that, too. At any rate, the reason I got so into crime was not that I thought it was cool. It was because I didn’t think it involved much risk at all. Crime was boring. It was not the kind of exciting, dangerous, thrilling thing that you’d go to school to do—just to get caught. When I was in high school, I knew what I was doing all along: I would walk from my bedroom to the street where my mom would teach me how to be a criminal. If your life revolves around a crime, you have to be able to commit crimes. Then you learn how to stop. It wasn’t until I got a few years of experience running a few bars that I understood why many people don’t like crime. That, to me, was the thing that gave back what was taken. Because criminals have no choice. If they don’t try something new, the only choice is if it succeeds. I learned how to find new ways to do that every day. It was my first real experience of growing up with no friends, no family, nothing but my mom and me. It was the first time I went outside, I went back in time, I learned how to live with a family, how to get by alone. I learned to be my own boss, and if anyone would have taught me anything I would be so grateful. It wasn’t that long ago that I had all the skills and resources I needed to start a bar. Now, I had to find a few people who could work on my bar in exchange for some compensation and a little something to do. The whole thing was a gamble. But as my time at bar M.L.T. dragged in and out, my mom had my back. In the beginning I had my share of the problems—the same people. But by the time my mom got to know all of us, the only problem remained: the problems. People’ problems. The things that people in my life didn’t like, things I couldn’t see through the walls, things that I couldn’t handle, things about us that would cause trouble. But in the end it was my mom, my grandmother, who was the one who made me decide: I could handle this or I would be in trouble. The only limit to my personal freedom in this little piece of America was the way I saw it: There was no more freedom for blacks in my hometown than at least, for my generation. As long as we were the descendants of the black majority, our future was up for grabs. I never thought it would end like it did. But as time went on, I found that my mother would be right as rain, my father would be right as rain, and my kids would not be any darker or richer than the average child in my street. They wouldn’t be so poor that they could not go to school. If anything, my kids would have more money than I have. But my dad knew better. He didn’t want them to be like everyone else: he’d give thema chance—to succeed. He would help them get ahead, and he would give them a hand whenever they needed it. I don’t remember anything except for one time my grandma had a dream: when she was a little girl and her grandmother gave her a book of fairy tales, she was completely obsessed with it. The first time my sister said she wanted to read one of the fairy fairy tales she was reading, one of the things she did was buy an old book for her to read from cover to cover. She’d never bought a new one before. The covers of the new fairy stories were all red—a symbol of rebellion. Her mom gave her a set of red scissors so that when she saw that red they would never look red in the same way. The books in the house would never look different from the first time: red for love, red for mischief, red for danger. My mom knew that, and knew that the only way to change her daughter’s life was to break off our relationship. She’d spend the day with my sister, my niece, and my niece’s nephew, and then go off to buy a book at a book store. In the morning, she would bring me my grandma’s favorite book. I didn’t understand why. It was an old fantasy novel by a boy named Peter Pan. It was a classic story about children growing up in an era before science and math and everything else. It was an old favorite, and I remember the whole thing with those two boys and all that—I remember how happy our parents were, how wonderful my childhood was, how much of a miracle our mother, who came from a very poor family, and all of us were. But that morning in school, the books didn’t belong to us. They belonged to my two cousins. One of them was a science teacher; the other was an accountant. My cousin said I had to go to live at his house with him, and I was going to live on his lot in a small cottage in a clearing. I came home one afternoon and found my dad, a very unhappy man. When he saw us, he was like, “What the hell did you just do?” That was the beginning of the end for our relationship. My dad wanted to go live with his mom. I told him no. The last thing he said to me that night was, “You are a boy and you have a right to be at your own pace. And I am going to take advantage of that opportunity for my own growth and evolution. But you can have both of those things at the same time.” “What?” He laughed. I wasn’t surprised. He had always made it clear, at any time, that he didn’t trust me. My dad had learned his life lessons by now. I was a good-natured little girl who made friends easily: a lot of hanging out, a lot of laughing. But the thing about hanging out is you are hanging out with people, not hanging out with machines. I was hanging out with machines, and I had a machine to prove it. So the first thing I did before bed was look over my shoulder and see my mom, who had left her job and her career in marketing at a major company to go back to school and pursue the creative side. I was a natural. My mom was a great communicator. Her smile, her humor, made everyone feel at ease. I was the opposite: I would have none of it. At one point my mom, who loved animals more than anyone I knew, was so sick of the kids hanging out in the park at the park she decided it was time for us to go outside. The only way I could get out of here was to go get my father, and he was not going to let me stay inside the house and stay outside the yard. I was the luckiest kid in the world. I came home one afternoon and asked my mom what she was going through. She told me everything: I was having a hard time with my father, all of the weird behavior I was seeing in him. The last thing I remember from that day has changed my life. It has changed my life for the better, as a whole. That was not just my mom taking time to visit a sick person: that was her doing. That was her doing for the people in her life. I never knew that feeling. I never cared. I wasn’t trying to be anything except a good friend. I never cared about anyone. That first weekend I went to see my uncle on a summer day, I told him everything that was happening. We got to talking.We talked about my life. He told me that for the rest of my life — and there would be a day for my mom to make the decision — she and all our other cousins, who live with us in this one homestead in the middle of nowhere, would all be allowed to move back in with their own families there. That was my last hope to have a normal childhood with my family. One night at least I knew who I was, which was a big deal because it meant that I didn’t have anyone else at my house to make that decision for me. I was totally alone. The only people around me and in my life were my four younger cousins, my aunt, my grandmother, and my great-grandmother, who lived in a hut at the farmhouse, on the edge of town. The land was ours for the taking, the dirt for the tools and the tools made for the home. I had two options: go back to my homeland in the Congo, or make a choice and live with my relatives all my life in a jungle where the only thing that matters to you and everyone else is how rich you make it. For a year or so my decision was easy. We all went back and lived with our relatives the way they had lived their entire lives—with their husbands and their kids, working all the time, going back to school for a degree. Then I made some more decisions. I didn’t want to be around them. I wanted to be with my mom. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to have any relationship with my dad in my life. The only thing that made that relationship any fun for my mom and Dad was that my relationship with my mom gave them one of the best support network experiences of any couple I knew of that age. They’d give their advice as friends. That’s not the type of thing you get from the outside world. So what can I do now? I was the only one who understood all the things they went through. I could be the one telling them how to live, what to eat, what to wear. I knew how to make it fun and easy for them. I loved it. It was great. I was the only person in their lives who knew how to keep me grounded and at ease. At least I had a relationship with them. It would turn out to have been a complete success. When they moved back into their family house, our only remaining links were our cousins in the town. I was their only link, but my life was their little secret. It was the one place we never shared our family secrets, because we knew what was expected of us — but that was also a world they could never control. I would be in their lives, their children, and the house. My cousins would do the laundry. They would take care of whatever chores or chores my younger brothers and I did. But from that point on my life changed. Everyone knew everything about my life, and it was no longer about getting by. It was about becoming my own man. For the first time in my life I didn’t have anyone telling me what to do. My only guidance was a set of set of hands that I could control, the people who told me what to do. That was how it was. I was the one, as a boy, holding up the bar for all the rest at the other boy's wedding. My cousins all took the dance floor, which was a big deal to them because they knew how to do something special. They knew how to dance. They danced to a song that was their favorite. I was the one giving them tips for keeping the dance moving. They told me how to stay ahead of the music. The dance floor at their family’s wedding was the highlight of their entire day. It was like my mother was the star of the show at every party that year, dancing with the best dance stars of the city. My cousin’s family — that’s who you hang out with in a restaurant, the ones who make your favorite cocktail after your favorite movie. And that’s a special day. It’s a day that everybody does together. It’s a day that everyone comes and gets to spend as a family with a bunch of your friends. A night at the movies? Sure, go ahead and go. But for the rest of the time you’re hanging out, watching a little movie. It could be a comedy, or an erotic romance, or a romance in a book or a play. All of them could be great films. But for us in the house there was just one thing we enjoyed as much as anything: watching the movies together on the couch. We would watch thesame movies for hours. You could hear the laughter. You couldn’t really tell if a joke was funny or not. It was just fun. We weren’t even allowed to sit next to each other during a movie or sit on the same stage for a musical performance in front of the same audience. Then one afternoon we’d go into a club, and this girl that was sitting in the front row was the best thing that had ever happened in our lives. This girl looked beautiful. She was the most beautiful girl you had ever seen; a gorgeous golden blonde with perfect skin and a perfect body. It was a great day, a good day, because our mom had come home from work and been working all day, and her eyes were really shining. Just seeing her smile made the day worth it. A few weeks later she and her boyfriend, who was another big-breasted guy wearing only a turtleneck, were both dancing. It made its way over the dance floor, so to speak, to the back of the club. That night the DJ was playing some hip-hop music. I and my friends and the other people in the dance club were all listening to the same beat. It was amazing, and when we got up to dance, no one was dancing—no one was turning their backs. There was a guy in the front and a girl at the back. My mom stood next to me on the dance floor, and I tried to dance, too. But, because I had my hands in my pockets, I never got up well enough. As soon as the guy in front had a few hits to go, I had no interest. I was in the zone and there wasn’t anything else to do. Then when he finally broke his set, everybody looked at me. Then it was my turn. I started out slowly, just sitting in silence. It was a little while before I felt comfortable enough to dance. As I was dancing slowly, I noticed a pattern. As soon as I started a song, I started moving my hands out toward my sides. It was like I was dancing backwards and forwards in reverse. There was no music playing when I was dancing, just just movement. As soon as the music started to fade out, I was in a trance-like state. I knew exactly where to be and where to be when I wanted to be, as though my body was a switch in the middle. This woman wasn’t interested in me dancing any more. She was so nice. She gave me a lift to work on my technique. I felt like it was a step forward in my life. But as time went on, there was a definite change. The dance changed. The music changed. My mother became a choreographer. Then, after a period of some years, my mother moved on to be in charge of running the kids. At home, we’d listen to music. Then, one evening my mom came over, and after the music was done, she opened the stereo and played some hip-hop music. I didn’t recognize any of the artists at all, like Nas or Erykah Badu. But I was so much more into it. I started laughing my head that it seemed like the whole world—especially the American music community—was laughing at us. The next morning, my mom came home, not even the slightest bit drunk. It was one of those perfect days when no matter what happened to me, I could turn on my television to watch how other people were dealing with things. This woman was living life on its own terms with no boundaries. It wasn’t even in her nature to break them. This woman, in all of its complexity and its complexity, was one of the most amazing human beings I ever saw on television. My first experience with America was when I was a baby. I was born in a clinic in a slum in the slums of South Africa. It was a terrible, horrible and unsafe place. I had no running water, and my mother wouldn’t let me use the tap when the power was out. I watched as my mother treated people from time to time, but the whole time we were separated there was always one woman who was the one person who was the main caretaker: the woman who treated you like a baby. All day long, every day my mother would clean for us, bathe us, clean our floors. And when I was a baby—and this was an amazing thing—the only time in the house was when we’d have chores. I mean, we were a family, we always had our little chores: I would clean for her and then come home from work and clean my sister and my mother’s kitchen for me—thatwhat family was all about. And then when she got home from school, we’d get our kids to school to play—and if they’d do any schoolwork at all, I’d have a special treat for them, and I’d get to spend an afternoon on my own making them. It was always nice to be close to my mom, to be close to them at every turn. We’d catch up at dinner—there was always something to eat and something to do. At home, we watched TV from our living space, sometimes one hour before the next. We’d get together and watch all the news: The latest terrorist attacks in Syria; a massacre in Nigeria; some crazy thing that happened in France. I loved watching those. And then I would run the risk of waking my mom. The way I understood life at home was, if I had a choice in the matter, I was going to stay home. Not take the trouble of going up to my sister in-law and complaining about how unfair this was. My little sister would step in and help figure out how unfair this was. If I had a choice, maybe I would have stayed at home and been like, 'Hey, mom, now that all of that is happening…' There were times, though, in which I felt like it was my responsibility to be the reason why. I was the one in charge, and if I didn’t get my act together, then that would just continue to happen all by itself. I was on my own, and that gave me the power to make a difference. What made the choice easier for me is that it was something I knew and cared about in a way that other people, especially kids, didn’t: I knew what to expect, what to accept, what didn’t work, what to change, what needed to be fixed. When things didn’t go well, I knew immediately, “I have my daughter. You need to do something. If it isn’s not fixed right away, I’ll be back.” A child growing up with that kind of discipline and attention needs to learn to be independent to some degree; he’s not going to stay a puppet on the parents' back for his whole life, and he needs to learn how to take control and be on his own. I knew when I was a kid that it wouldn’t be easy. There wasn’t going to be a master plan that everyone followed. There were many times when I looked forward to going back to my mom and asking her for guidance on a tough decision. At the time I knew nothing I did did was going to change her. But in the back of my mind, I knew I had a better idea. I knew that if it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have had a career. So I did. At some point I figured out that there was no point in asking for anything but an immediate change in circumstances. It wasn’t that I didn’t appreciate her, but the way her life was going, if I wasn’t going to give her that, why would anybody else? “Why can’t you just let things unfold naturally?” And that night, when we finally had those long nights together and I needed her help, I could have gone to her and said, “I want you to take care of my kids for me. Why not give them your blessing, too, and let them be with you in peace?” The last thing I had going for me was my mom being my mom. In all these years of marriage, I’d never felt like she’d been there for me. Whenever I needed her to intervene, she would step back and say, “Do this. There is no point in trying. It never worked. You need to take a step back and figure out what you want to do.” In my mind, she wasn’t doing that. I saw the problem through. And because it never occurred to us that there might be a problem between them, she never asked. There wasnT even talk in the house about it. For as long as I was a kid, my mother, who loved her children deeply to the point of obsession, never wanted her children to be alone. I never experienced the sense of, “I just need someone to come over to check things out and see how it works.” That was my mom’s way of saying, “We’ are good parents because our kids don’t need an adult. We need a friend they cancount on. But there’s still a barrier between you and us, and there wasn’t one between you and my mom. They were not like parents together: “No, my husband is a professional football player.” No, my mom and dad weren’t like that. At least I didn’t grow up with their relationship because I didn’t learn from it. Instead I learned the skills they had developed when they were young. My mother and I worked at the same coffee shop in the same corner on Eighth Street; a few blocks from my mom and my dad’s house. If I wanted a cup of coffee, we would go to the coffee shop. If I wanted a cup of coffee in front of our family, that was theirs. That’s exactly what happened: I was a good coffee drinker, a good conversationalist, a good cook—when I came at the end of the day it was just coffee. I didn’t even know then, nor did I care, how many cups of coffee I had to be finished to finish the day. I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere where I could talk to people unless my mom’d let me. That was the beginning of me becoming a complete asshole to my mom. At home, I used to talk for longer and longer on the phone; at work, I talked for short periods. At work, I could keep a conversation going for three hours or until my wife came home from work. At home, I could go to my sister’s house, sit around, and have a little chat. But if we went anywhere that weekend, my sister and my mom told me to be quiet, or something bad would happen. The way they knew what was coming was, at least in my family, through the eyes of a six-year-old. It was as if I had a sixth sense. In a way, I knew exactly when to go: At work, it was a Saturday, and it was a Saturday afternoon. We’d go get coffee from the coffee shop. At home, my mom got my brother, my brother’s friend. Both were six or seven years our senior. They were both in their parents' home, working and studying for their master's degrees at the same time. My brother and his friend had been on their way to school for a two-hour drive the whole weekend, making sure all their parents were home so they could come and get their kids and go. They’d come over for lunch. In my father’s life, he had an idea—and I would be the perfect lawyer to pull it off. But for the rest of his life, my mom and Dad would tell my mom, We didn’t want you to be with him and it didn’t matter, because we loved you. And that was the case for a very long time. It was not until they divorced in 1996 that my mother changed her mind. She got a lawyer, but it wasn’t easy. It’s not like she wasn’t smart as nails, or that we were any different. Even if someone told her she could make a career of it, she would choose her own path. The biggest problem for her was that she did know what was best for her family. She knew the best way to care for her three kids would be to stay home. So her mother gave her a license to do that. Even today, at age fifty-three, I still don’t understand why in my lifetime someone came up with such a brilliant idea: We should have a baby and have a normal, happy family because if that was the only way we wouldn’t have a son, my mom would have chosen a life of crime, not life in the United States. So here I was, forty-five years later, living a double life as the mother of three—an existence so full of anxiety and doubt and anger that I never grew up with any of those experiences, nor would I ever want to grow up in one of those homes. I am lucky that my younger brother, now twenty-three years his senior, came to live with us and taught me some of that too. He never forgot the house with the dogs and chickens, or the garden with the plants and the animals. The one with the grass, the one with the trees, the one with the birds, the tree. I’d play with the animals and ride the horses.” I got along with my little brother just fine. That was my experience. But that’s why so many of us went to prison at some point.We were all living in some version of "the Ghetto." It was a place where the majority was African. We’d be living in an apartment, so we’d be eating out of a garbage can. It’s where the majority of the people were drug dealers. You could buy cigarettes, you’d be smoking crack cocaine—not a real cigarette. You could buy crack from any corner of town. That was the life we had. I had that advantage. My mom taught me how to have fun when life brought me joy—and that was that, really. She taught me the value of the family. At least, if you were not with me, you knew a lot of the things that would have happened if I never was with my mom. For one thing, I learned how to make myself into an example, and that wasn’t easy. After all my years at home, I knew how to keep someone else around, whether it was my dad or my younger brother growing up or anyone else. So whenever anyone asked or called me about them, I would say, “No, that’s not the reason, that’s not how it works. You need a dad to be with you. To be supportive. To take the initiative in situations that other people would find themselves in. That’s when you have your daddy. It doesn’t make sense, but that doesn’t bother anyone because the only reason that person was with your mother was because you needed those things from him. That’s what his bond was—you took care of his needs and he took care of your needs. I never questioned it, but at least I knew it would work for him. But for me, the thing about my father was that he did a lot of things without asking any questions. He took care of his money. He didn’t question it. And he didn’t have to do the same thing for the same reason. If something went wrong, or he was not up to his usual standards, he would just say, “I don’t feel my responsibility to do the other thing,” and that would be it. It is an important lesson in human nature that if you do things your way and have a bunch of people around you who will do your bidding, they’re going to come at you from behind. So my dad always said to me, “If you want to be great, you have to change.” And I didn’t ever learn that lesson. I learned that lesson the hard way, but now I remember it, and I know that if I was ever going to change, I had to change. I had another life that I loved, a life that was full of friends and laughter and a constant, loving relationship with my mom, and it was time to move on. I knew then that in a world of violence and drugs that there was a chance for me to have a successful career in entertainment—and even have a family. After my time in L.A. ended, I moved to the United States to be with my brother, whom I had met and fell in love with in a short time. We became best friends with his mother—a middle-aged, single woman of Middle Eastern descent. After a few years, we split up, and my brother went to live with his sister in New Jersey, a big city in America. The sister, a wonderful lady, took him to stay in her home and got him a new puppy. I was in the city once a year during the summer for my father’s bachelor celebrations. It was a hot day, and it was a very hot, very humid day. It was my dad’s birthday. I remember the day very well, because that Saturday I was at school, but for some reason he didn’t tell me anything. His mother had arranged for the school’s principal to be there, and since my dad wanted it to be an open-air party, no formal invitation had been sent. My sister's mother was at that same birthday party, so that’s why the principal was there. When my father came downstairs to see me, all he saw was my sister crying and her mother, my dad, and a white couple at the door. It was the parents that had instigated this whole thing. My dad was just a normal guy, an older guy, a bit of a jerk, but not a bad guy. I liked him for the way he was. But I knew what I had in him—I just didn’t quite know what in me was holding me back from giving him my heart. I wasnever going to date a woman who cheated on me with anyone but me. So when I finally did get the ring, and I got to do it right—the first thing I took away from it was that if anything, I was getting a lot of satisfaction out of hurting a woman. I didn’t have any friends who wanted a girl like that, and I was never going to have as many friends with a girl as I had with my mom. In those days, the women in my life all knew that if a boy cheated on her, she had to face that pain: I was going to take it out on him one day. That’s what she would have wanted, and she was so right. A typical morning at that school, with us all in class, we would get into our cars to head to school. One morning it was the middle school day—that was when the girls were out. I was the only boy who did not get in my car, but one of the boys who was not with me was one of the girls who had asked her to do something naughty, and one of the girls who was doing it was a cute little pink-and-white-and-blue-haired girl named Viv. The three other guys, my dad and our friends, were all up and about, driving to school, hanging out in the parking lot, doing what boys do. There was one other kid in the car, a cute little little black kid. All three of them were dressed exactly like that pink-and-blue-haired girl. They looked like they were doing exactly the same thing. They had the same black hair. I didn’t know what a pink-and-white-and-blue-haired kid was. There were so many of me. By morning everyone was having a good time. I was in the back. Everybody was having a good time. It was the one time in my life when I became a really good friend. It was the other day that a woman from that school told me, “That’s the most amazing thing,” “your heart.” When she said that I couldn’t have a girlfriend, it wasn’t my favorite moment of the day. On some level I felt like I had already made this decision, because by noon I had already packed up my bags, and with my mom's blessing, I was the biggest girl of the group in school. My parents had always been like, “Why do you guys have kids?” That’s when my mother said something like, “That’s what we needed to grow up with, not with a mom telling kids what to do. Kids can learn to do anything.” She meant that, but what she didn’t understand was that I wasn’t allowed to be that. Every now and again I would ask my mother and my brother—our dad’s family, the oldest of seven sons, I suppose; but their kids were my children—for advice. But we would give our kids no advice. The reason I was so much like my dad is that my mom had always stood up for herself. My childhood, which included an abusive, alcoholic mother who abused her children, was a perfect example of that. If my dad had not made a life-changing decision to leave my mother, I could have become a complete failure because everyone at the house was looking out for him. There would have been no problem with that. Even as a child, that woman in his life had a way with words. She knew where to go, how much to talk, how much to read. That was a big deal for him. She taught him the ins and outs of life at such a young age that he was the best man at many the wedding parties of his generation, too. I learned how to be a man from that woman. In my mind, that woman was a woman I could be with and fall in love with. And my life would be so much easier going that way. The thing was, the moment I became part of that woman's life, I understood exactly what it had done to the family to have a man as my stepfather. The stepfather was like a surrogate father, the mother’s surrogate, someone whom she could use to help raise the kids as he was. But I hated that. I didn’t like the idea of him ever seeing me as a woman, ever thinking about himself as a man. I hated that my life and mine—which, for the most part, I felt a part of—would always be defined, in essence, by their male partners. In retrospect, I understand why my mother chose to have me and staymarried. When we were younger and our fathers were more supportive, the girls could leave the house at any time and go to school whenever they wanted. The boys got to spend their time with their fathers and go to school as equals. When my dad got sick in 2002—my first diagnosis of cancer—my mother had no health insurance in our budget at all, and I could not come out on my own. In fact, from one point, from the day my mom and the boys decided to get married we thought that they had a real chance. That day the only thing we had on offer to our kids, to keep my mom happy is our money. I was six years old and had no access to my own money. It was my responsibility now to go to my grandmother. On the day of the wedding my mom was so excited she asked my mom in—wait for it—the biggest restaurant in town, where everyone knew who her favorite restaurant was to go to for lunch. As our waitress looked through what my mom had ordered—a huge plate of meatballs, steaks and burgers at the biggest burger joint in town—it struck me: It was totally overpriced for what you actually get. But that wasn’t my problem. I didn’t care, because no matter what they said, my mom always had the most fantastic flavor. If the hamburgers weren’t good, then why shouldn’t the hamburgers be better? Because in her mind that was a reason she wanted my kids to grow up to be great people. I had no problem with that. I got the point. It didn’t take a genius to figure out the math to show her how much better it was for us if we ate at Burger King than if we had my mom cook our favorite burger. My mom was a total perfectionist, but she never shied away from cooking. I loved my mom. I was her only child, but all of my life I was told that the only way a guy is good for you is if he stays home and raises his family. It didn’t make sense for anyone else in the family except our own: He took care of his father, he cared as much for his mother as he did for his daughter, he was a dad that took good care of his children. It worked. One day as our family sat on the floor in awe at one another, the only things that struck us as strange were that each other was making so much money—$1 billion in a matter of years. That summer my mom took over the family business: We opened The Family Fish, a chain of restaurants in and around Seattle, including our first McDonald’s. I remember one time a week my mom took me to a McDonald’s and we had one of those long lines. The line was so long, they didn’t even bother waiting. Then my mom decided to take the long line outside the restaurant. She was wearing nothing but a tiny white T-shirt and black-and-white-and-blonde-and-pink skirt, and she was taking everybody for a walk down the street. She didn’t look me in the eye, but the whole time she seemed to be smiling. One of the kids in the line said something to her in Japanese and she started laughing. At least I was taken aback a little. But this little child was so cute, that was the end of it. It took me almost a minute before I realized what I was doing: I was giving them a reason to smile back, and to give us the best meal that’s going to happen to us. When I walked behind her and saw a kid looking up at us, I didn’t know what to do. “What happened?” “Oh, it’s OK to be mean,” said the little kid. We got along so well. It was like we were back where we knew we couldn’t be anymore. I mean, he was so friendly and so down to earth. I was like, Oh, my God, what have I gotten myself into? But of course it wasn’t my fault: I was the one who made him mean. I wasn’t doing anything in the matter, just making him fun. We’d catch up, we’d talk. Then I’d go eat something. That’s what he would have had me for dinner. I was like, Oh, that’s just the way my mom works. I never understood this kid. I was always the sweet one. But, as I walked into our little restaurant, the first thing that came up to my eye wasthis beautiful woman in a red dress. It was June of 1996, and I had my first real date. It was the first girl that was cool in my life. It was like I was a teen rock star. It was the biggest thing in the world. All day, everyone was drinking, dancing, and hanging out. It was the hottest dance and music festival in South Africa. The DJ set up, the bands were on, the performers came out, and it was a perfect day to date a girl. But as I was walking through that small town one morning, just because it was June in 1996 didn't mean any of my friends or the people I knew were into it. We weren't all hip to the new wave anymore. Some of their songs were all over the place. Some of their songs had lyrics like, I'm not into the new wave. I don't know why they said that, but for some reason my friends didn’t take notice. I was the only girl in my circle who was into the new wave. As I walked away from that little restaurant, I just couldn’t believe I hadn’t seen this face in another human being — that face. I knew the look inside of someone’s eyes. I knew how it looked. I was the only girl in my home school, the only girl on that team at a small club called Guts and Glory. I was on the roster for my club. If anyone asked me if I could ever move to be the next Nirvana and become the next Korn — the next Pearl Jam — I would tell them, “No, no, No, this is Nirvana. We’re on the other end of Nirvana. We don’t even do Korn anymore. Just our one song, “Nirvana.” If you look at the music video of us playing on MTV, I couldn’t have been more than 15 years old when that song came out. That song was about us going through all that, and it was the first time we felt like it. But that song, to me, meant that for the first time in our lives, there was a connection that only a girl could have. That feeling of belonging was everything. It just so happened that one day that girl, at least I thought she was the girl who was my soul mate all along, turned out to be a woman who had the world at her feet. At the very least, that was my connection. It was her, and from that point, all the guys in our school, even some of the girls, would call me by that nickname and we’d hang out. I’d take a drink, get a drink, go down. I didn’t like it in school. I didn’t get along with it all that well at all. The only problem was that I was a weirdo. I didn’t really fit in at school. I was the weirdo student. I wasn’t good at anything. I wasn’t in the cheerleading team. I wasn’t good at sports. I’d be sitting in my room and watch the cheerleaders do all the best they could do in the school cheerleading team and I wasn’t getting any recognition? The school would take great pride in their cheerleading team and I wouldn’t show up. The school would give special privileges to one cheerleader, I would go sit outside in a field. I had no friends. I would never have any friends. I didn’t belong. My whole life I was the butt of every joke around the school yard. Every time somebody told someone my funny story, they had a good laugh. It started off cute. Then some other kid told it, somebody from an athletic team. Then I was asked for a song. The school asked me to sing a song. I sang a song, and the school took me and the school band, so that school was our stage at the music festival. When the festival started, I couldn’t walk. I couldn’t walk in the street without a band around me to help me. We were in costume and on drums. But as the festival went on, I began to question everything. I was sick every night. I didn’t see any reason why I shouldn’t make my mom some extra money for me to pay for my stuff. Why can’t you just afford the medical costs, or the food, or the medicine instead of just using the money to make your life more convenient for the day? I kept feeling like every time I’d come home from the festival, my mom’s response had been, “You wantto be a nurse? That is what you used to do.” “Well, if you want to be a doctor, that is what you would be doing.” I never did learn how to think about life as a work. That would have been another life. It would have been a whole different life. I didn’t learn about leadership skills. I didn’t take advantage of the opportunities in education to learn those skills. Instead, my life was filled with an enormous amount of frustration and shame about the fact that this woman had never been a leader herself. She was always the smartest person in the room. That was the way she did things. But in any given moment there was a good reason why she wasn’t. She hated the way it felt to be a woman in the kitchen, because it wasn’t what she did, and that was what it was all about. For years it was me, the black woman, getting our food—just us and white tables—for a table at our table and being served by a white woman. This table sat in front of ours. I was the only woman. I was the only black man. We always had white and Indian and Jewish and mixed people at the table, but the other women on our table were all women and all had gone to work for the women’s organizations. The only black people in our kitchen were those white women. All the other women and children were white. Even now it is only now that I know what happens when you marry a black man or a white man, because my mom still treats us with a level of disrespect that I never would have if I hadn’t been a person like my dad. We went with him to a lot of parties, and we were so in the party atmosphere, but I felt like my dad was the only one at the table and everyone else just sat down and were treated like guests. I couldn’t bring myself to stay in the kitchen. My dad would have me leave at the party, or he would take me to the back. His house didn’t have any front door. I always found him very, very cold. Even as an adult, I knew I was different because of the people who knew him, and I couldn’t be like him. I was never comfortable in his presence. I was not his daughter. I had a different identity that I wanted to live up to. I felt more like a person living her own life and doing her own thing than a person in a family or a marriage or a job. When I turned 16, I left home. I started my own life with my own little business, which was something my mom, who had always taken a hands-off approach to her children, had given me a try. We got a new man, and a new girl. I started my own business and my son became the father of his son, who was the man of his own house. As the years went by I tried other things. I tried moving out of my mom’s house, working from home, sleeping on the floor outside in the yard. My whole life, I had always felt like the answer to all problems in my family, my father said, was to put your family first. I said no. I didn’t give a damn. I was a woman, so I knew exactly what I wanted: more men, more men working in the kitchen, more men at the family business, just more men with power. I wasn’t going anywhere. The first woman in my life to date who didn’t work, or didn’t care about working at all, was a woman named Mary. Mary was my stepfather. And she wasn’t a good mother. She was violent, a tyrant. Mary was abusive—and she hated being in a loving relationship. And if you think it was because he was in love with me, well, it wasn’t true. That didn’t stop her from trying to take over my life. I tried to help. I tried to make things right. But eventually, Mary didn’t love me for who I was. At least, not the way she thought it was. Mary was a bad mother. My father came out of the woodwork to help her. I was his firstborn child. I became their secondborn child. I had the same firstborn grandaughter. I had every male relative that my father had, and the same number of male relatives that my mother had. From all three sides of the family my life had been my dad’s. I had the closest thing to an extended family in my father’s backyardThe only other family in my street I saw were my mom’s and her father's in this two-story home. It was a house that was always on his mind: When I was a kid my house was the only place in the neighborhood where people played—that one backyard. My dad played in the backyard. I was always the only kid in a backyard. My life in that backyard was no different than mine in my mom’s house. But the backyard had the added benefit of allowing him to have a place where he could hang out like everyone else. It was a place we always played in, and it was a place everyone had at least a friend there. It was just his home, and he was always around whenever he wanted to be. It was a perfect balance of two worlds: My dad, who would stop by my mom’s house for a couple. My mom, who was so into her gardening, would keep up with the housework. At least we always stayed in the house. It had the best view of the garden the whole time. My father had the best garden around. And the coolest dog in the world was a pit bull. My mom also had an amazing set of skills if you asked the question, which skills? Her hands were amazing. I remember as a kid, I would always ask my mom, the first question, if that would help me. Her answer always was always, yes. Now here was my problem. I would always ask the same question when the kids all showed up for my parents’s first wedding reception, the one with the flowers and the cake. In our house those first two months were some of the hardest for my mother because she was the only person in her life, on her own, responsible for raising my siblings. There would be a long pause. Then she would come over. And this time I would get a little annoyed. No. No, I wouldn’t talk to her, or to my brother, or to my stepfather, to talk to the other boys. Not even to play outside with the neighbor kids. Not even to play any games with them—any game—in the backyard. My oldest brothers could play at the backyard, and my mother would give us a little toy for our younger cousins to play with. But that game was for her. For us at least, there was no play with your sister. My mom was the ultimate housekeeper. She would take care of the kids and the house—every step of the way. We would all live in an igloo, a small, concrete box. My father would go to town to find the best food in town for his family. If he wanted something to eat, he would have to come and get it for himself. If he wanted the same food in the middle of the day I would cook for him, as well. But my mom knew how to be a housekeeper. A housekeeper would have time. My father would get up at 3am every morning for three days straight to see how everyone was doing—and then he would have a little nap. My dad never had any time for any entertainment, or any sports. I remember, too, the time my dad once left his house for work to go see a movie. The first thing my mom did after we got home was get the kids ready. The movie was a huge success. But for the parents on this family, it was time for the movie to go. And they were right—they were the nicest, most loving people we knew, the most funny, the most fun-loving family we ever knew. But that movie wasn’t playing in the house. In fact, one year my mom decided one of her kids was sick and wanted us to watch the movie together. We didn’t have a choice. When I was a little kid I could not do what my mom did. I was the center of the family all the time. My mom didn’t have the energy for me because it was clear that she didn’t want me at home, either on the job—making the kids do chores or whatever—or at least for a second, spending time with me. It was easy for us to say no, because it looked like we would be going back into the house. That was always the end of that. In the years that followed my mom never once tried to change. I could tell right away that she had lost a touch with reality. I remember the day we decided we couldn’t live like that ever growing up. It was the middle of winter, and that was the last day of the school year. As the school year drew to a close, my dad and his friend, an older boy in our schoolstarted looking for another job at a local car dealership. We worked a minimum number of hours that semester, but that was about it. I wasn't allowed to do much outside that, but my mom loved me very much. I had an affinity for cars and had a strong interest in them as a young boy. I went to many car dealerships for my first job out there—at a big luxury car store on the street. My dad took me on a test drive, and this place came off really well for the first time in my life—the car was always working. I got in my BMW and was off, my parents took their first vacation in months, and the whole thing was great. I felt like I needed no introduction to my new friends. They were my entire world. I learned fast: I wasn't that good at hiding or hiding behind a mask. So, instead of going into a car dealership, I decided to do something different: go to the back roads and explore. That first year, I drove around for five days with a friend. This was a time when my friends didn’t talk much—it was all for sport, so no one asked questions and no one talked about anything. I didn’t ask any of them for anything. After that, I didn’t hang out with them at all all. That is, by that point—five days later—I was out on my own, my own in-between-the-lines, my own unique way of life. I didn’t know what a back road was: The one with the trees, the grass, the roads filled with people, no one there to be friendly. It was not much—just some grassy meadows and some shade from the sun, but the road was just a few hundred meters away from where our house had once been, so it was a lot that we could do all by ourselves. The first few months after leaving home, after the family came back to our hometown and set up shop as the Waukegan Townhomes, I spent a lot of time hanging out and walking the streets. I was an outsider there for the most part. The next thing I knew, I was the odd man out. When one person is not hanging out, someone is. It was my first chance at really hanging out with other people, and after an afternoon of hanging out, I decided to get my own place. I found a place to stay, called the Hulmburg. Hulmburg is the old town in Waukegan, a small, one-room home on a dirt road. Hulmburg, like most areas of the city, was a very working-class area during the manufacturing and export years during the 1920s and early 1930s. It wasn’t like any other area in the city. In the old days, people lived on the land, worked in the factories, and lived off of their labor. But in those years people used to live in shacks, which meant there had been no construction, no new houses. So when you moved here to live in one of these shacks, you got right in. The first thing I noticed about Hulmburg wasn’t just the place itself—I saw it. It looked like an ordinary shantytown, but a very small one. As a kid, my first impression of Hulmburg was that it had been abandoned from the city—that all the houses had been bulldozed over to make way for a big factory or some other industry. That was the thing that made me think, Maybe I shouldn’t become a factory worker in the city; maybe I should live in a hulk. That was probably the best thing that ever happened to me; it was the beginning of what would be a remarkable story of survival. It came out in the first season of the TV show "The American Dream." Every day at work, my dad took me to the car factory to pick up one of their best-known race cars. We had to drive to the factory, which was a half-hour and a half's drive from my neighborhood. So when one day our dad came up to pick me up, I knew this car would be the one. It was the car he would take me to race. The factory used to be a little bit nicer than my mother’s house, but after her husband died, they couldn’t afford a second house and moved to a little trailer on the side of the road, and they hired workers from the neighborhood to live there. But my mother had a garage, and my father owned a few businesses, and they could get together every so often for a weekend trip, but the one thing that kept them apart everySaturday was the barbecue. That's where the food was. That's where the best barbecue really was. The only time I went there was during the week. Sometimes I took the train to the airport to make the flight, but my parents would never accept a flight that day so my mother would take me to a restaurant called The Black Sheep, which was a full-on Korean barbecue joint, and it was the biggest joint in the whole place. It had all the best barbecue you could find; it was just a short walk from the airport. My dad, by contrast, had a place in a little black area in the back where my mom would prepare and sell the best barbecue, which was all you could eat from a big, open-faced platter. The best thing about me, my mom didn't like it much either. It wasn't that she was picky about what she ate or what kind of food she prepared, but every time The Black Sheep opened for business, it always seemed like we were at the same table. She always bought the meat; I bought the vegetables. The food always came out perfect, the vegetables were fresh, and I always got the whole platter of meat. For the most part we ate at home for dinner, but my mom always wanted us to try some of her favorite foods. She used to cook for the whole family once a year at an all-you-can-eat buffet with all the other families that were in Seoul. If you wanted some of her signature dishes, that was it. You couldn't miss it — the whole family would be there from 4 p.m. the first day of that year to 4 p.m. the second day of the following year. It was a lot of fun, but it was also a big step for my mom to give me a place of my own to eat when there wasn’t enough food to go around. At that point, I was six years her senior, which meant that if something happened to me that would have an impact on how our family was, I was completely the one in charge. That year that was the year I had my one major experience with women. It was a Saturday afternoon one afternoon in the spring of my senior year at South Africa’s Central High School, the most elite prep school in the country. A few girls in the boys’ soccer and basketball teams got into a fight at the soccer ground, and as we all walked home, one girl was carrying a giant, bright blue sign that said “No Boys This Week!”“The other girls came out to see if it was okay if they were all to run around with us, and since we were all young, they all did so in peace. The fight had ended, but the girls of that team — a diverse group of young women from around the country, mostly in their 20s from the countryside, were coming home for the weekend from school to play soccer, the national sport of South Africa. There were just a few boys in the school who didn’t get to play, which meant there was an especially large number of teams in the boys teams—the boys from the township. In the township there wasn’t much to play for. There is no high-school anymore, so the only sports the boys do are soccer and football. The only time you saw men play in those sports was in the backyard. I was an only child. It never occurred to me that I couldn’t play soccer with women. I was too much of a gentleman. I knew my mother wouldn’t let me play in the backyard. That was the time, that was the place where boys could play. I played with them and I played outside and I played in the street in the city outside the city, but I didn’t play outside in the country because I didn’t have one. At the time there was no such thing as a boy’s game. My soccer player’s sister, I don’t know what to say for the rest of us. It was an interesting time for me. After that I got really good with the men, and I played a few games on the road with the men. At one point we played a game at a soccer team’s ground on the weekend of a friendly with a team from Germany. The German was such a great team that they invited us all over for this friendly match, where they’d be inviting any team — teams from Europe, from South America, from Africa — to play, where they’d host a few international tournaments each year and then they’d invite us back one night and they would play another game at home and we all would come up to the field and play and it wasgreat. The first time I played against him back in 2006 we played like kings and then one Friday the first day I took a bus home from school and found out my dad, one of the greatest football writers in the world, had died. His death left this very young guy my uncle, our only family, without one. The rest of the family, our mom, my sisters, our five siblings, were all devastated. This was a very difficult year for them, and I was the only one who was with them. My dad was an incredible talent — not so much a football writer. He was also an awesome man, and I was never going to be like them. One night I’d gotten a call from my aunt, the American soccer mom. My mom got a call from her grandmother, the African soccer mom. This was an interesting opportunity, an opportunity for them to do something that they had been working on for decades: they needed to create a brand for one African nation. They wanted to do a football team, a soccer team, a soccer club. They wanted to put on one show once a year, an international soccer team. It took them a while as they set up, but once this was going forward they began getting the soccer players together at their homes. Then they set it off for two weeks of practice at the stadium, and they came back the next week, ready to go. Then the team started playing against the same teams from two or three months earlier. A little more than five years later, a new team comes. The team I was on last year was not the team that made headlines the next year. It was the national team. In the United States, soccer teams are teams. Every game of every game is a friendly match played against an opponent from a different continent. We play soccer for fun. I played for fun. I could have played at least half the games myself. But instead I just did the best I could at what I did. As for my mom, my mother knew I could be good at whatever thing I wanted to be good at, but she knew it would never be my fulltime job. She taught me everything about what happened at home to get me as far as I would go as a professional footballer, playing for the New England Revolution in the US Pro Soccer League, which started playing in the summer of 1998. It was a pretty amazing journey, one of most incredible ups and downs in my life. But one morning my sister-in-law, my mom—the person I had always wanted to be—called me out of the blue and invited me to join the Revolution Academy. The Revolution Academy is a soccer-playing, all-girls public school. As you can see from the photo on the wall at the front of my school, it was something out of fairy tales: There was no real instruction, like a traditional public school. There were no computers or technology. I got to play in a soccer stadium—a soccer pitch—that every girl here plays on. It was great, but it only lasted one day. Then it was over. So that very next morning my mom came home with a bag full of soccer kits to give. We were all at one table together talking, when the phone rang. It was my mom, my older brother Josh, and my little sister, who had the best soccer trick of all-time. That trick was, whenever I put something on a soccer ball, I was supposed to catch the ball and run away. The problem was, whenever I tried to do that, the ball would keep coming right back up over my head. It was like the ultimate dodgeball. I couldn’t do anything about it. I got my sister, my best friend. The other kids on the team were great. They could have beaten the hell out of me or my cousin, or my whole family, but they had a ball. In my mind I had no future at all. It was like I had never been through something before, ever. My only hope, as a seven-year-old, lay in the back of my mind: One night there’d be a game and I would be the star. No one else would have any say in the matter. But in reality there would be no way any of us could ever be more than two steps over from each other. Our lives would be complete, and everything would be exactly like it wanted to be. There wouldn’t be a moment in my life I’d want to go back to being just me, me, me, me. I had spent all my days training, playing, going to basketball games, and hanging out with my cousins on one of those weekends when the whole family came together. So it was a big deal for my family when I first steppedon to the team for the first time. One day we were playing in South Africa, and I turned to him and said, “Hey, if you see a guy, pick him up.” “No, I don’t want him hanging out at home and hanging out with his mother and his grandparents. Let me play.” The first game that summer for the South African National Basketball Team, I went up and played against the best players in the country. We took an early timeout outside court in front of our own bench, and my cousin came up. “Here is my cousin:” “Why don’t you bring someone over to play basketball with us one night?” “My mom says you’re a better basketball player than anyone we know.” My heart was pounding. I had never played alongside a man in my life before in my life. For the first time in my life, I was an NBA player. I didn’t know what to do. Then I saw him play. For the first time, he was a hero. That night, I took my first basket. I was on a team, playing in front of people the whole team wasn’t even there. There was a guy from our country. I was like, “Holy s***!” A million thoughts ran through my mind, but I couldn’t act on any of them. I walked over to that player and threw the ball over. The ball just bounced off his chest and the ball exploded into the hands of this guy who was already so good, I thought, Why would these two even want me? I was on the court, the game was on, and I was an absolute shit in the stands. One moment the guy was the best defender the team had ever had, the next he started getting bullied for no reason at all. This guy wouldn’t change. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could make a difference. For the first time in my life, I could be the difference between winning and losing. At that moment in time, I realized that no matter what I played in the league, no matter who I was with the team, no matter who I was on TV, that I could change the lives of millions of people. It just took time. But the one thing is, the NBA takes care of all of the money. It’s where my money goes, and if I take one step back I realize it’s where my life money goes as well, as your money. So I always have the ability to make a difference in the world. I play for the people—my parents. My brothers. My sister. The people who love me. That is their money; it’s the one thing that keeps me going, and it’s the first thing they have to give. It is their life. If I wanted to play in that world now, if I wanted to go play for that team right now, the most important thing to me would be, I need to stay in that house. I need to be with the people, and be with them as long with them as my life can last. The money makes the most of that. The only way to do that, in my mind, is to stay with the family. One evening, as the kids were finishing their chores, the kids in the basement came over and said, “Daddy! You need to go play in the street! We’ve seen what can happen when a kid can go to a mall. You gotta play for us!” I remember that night so well. I remember the thrill of discovery, the excitement of seeing this kid—a kid from such a poor family—in a different culture with an unbelievable culture of music, a different way of life. I saw that kid grow up the way I want to grow up. In a day, I was a professional musician. But I never wanted to be a commercial artist, so I stayed at home to play and study. I did, in fact, get a degree, because the way things were going in this world at this moment in time, what I didn’t know—and this is what will change your life—is that you can be a musician and an artist. For the first time in my life I saw a different side of the human condition, a whole new world of possibilities, a whole new life. The world is too nice. I hope that one day we all learn to love this great country and the great country will give us back our country—the American way. But until then, I will always be the American man.Thank God for my Dad. Thank God for my country. Thank God there are only some good guys in the world." —Michael Jordan in an ad promoting "One Two Three: A Basketball Family", filmed during an NBA All-Star Weekend. This ad showed Michael Jordan playing with his extended family around the country, including his son, Rani, with his father as his primary coach and all of his brothers. "Rani was always my best friend because of his talent. The best basketball is a two-way street—but no, my father always had me. He knew where to find the best people for me to play with my whole life. Rane, my father's older brother, was an incredible basketball player growing up but he never wanted to play with me. One Sunday night, during our family's break, Rani came home from school and I heard her crying. I looked up, and there was Rani in the middle of the family. There wasn’t an immediate reason for her to cry—I knew who my father was, and I liked my father. In the weeks leading up to my dad’s shooting, Rana and my family had spent all season together at his house in Narmada, a small village on the Tibetan plateau outside Beijing. The house was beautiful and had one large courtyard and a small backyard. Rana and my sister, my mother, my two older sisters, my brother, Rani (whose parents raised their children at home for the most part), and my cousin Rani’s kids lived with us at one point. But as a girl who had never known anything other than a family, Rana was a complete outsider at home. Rana came to see my father for his blessing. They had a great conversation, and my mother came out fully embraced. I have not spoken to my mother much in my life, but in that year, as a girl, I felt like my mom would have a say. But I couldn’t ask her to be the person who was going to change my life. I couldn’t ask her to be the woman. Rana was a single mom living her life on her own. That year, her only choice was to help raise her children or to raise her children herself. She didn’t need anyone else to care for them. They were all her children. “Let them do as they please.” That had never made me very comfortable growing up. Because Rana has a huge amount of pride, she knew what she didn’t want: A man who treated his daughters and his sons like they were second children; a man who treated them like second-class citizens; or, even worse, a man who took away the children’s right to be with their mothers. No one knew what the other did well, or what went wrong in their life. But in the end Rana got the answer: She chose to be her own person. As a child growing up in a family like my dad’s, I knew that every parent could do what the family did: Sit in a room and get together to raise children. It never occurred to me that there was a perfect set of guidelines for how a man should raise his daughter. It just didn’t occur to me that men were not the same. I was taught that if a man has a vision for his family, then everything else can follow: Men are not expected to care for children or their home; they are expected to be breadwinners. Men can do whatever the fuck they want with their time. Men and children are a sacred bond of this family. The children of the house must respect the men present and the men present must respect the children present. They must respect them all—the men, and the food. We were expected to have at least one meal a day when the men in our community didn’t want us. That day was a day out, which meant there was a big potluck. It was called “Lunch at the House” It was when I was two. We all ate at different restaurants around the neighborhood: Mimi and our mom had an Ethiopian restaurant in South Africa; Rana, I had a great aunt from Ethiopia who was from South Africa; my grandmother and great-great-grandmother, two great-great-grandmothers from a place called Durban, which was also a tiny, isolated island in the Indian Ocean. Mimi and our mom brought all of that food. There was no question that their food was amazing. They would have us eat there at a time in our lives, but the only thing they would make special was the meat—the animal.” “So, where do you keep that for yourself, Isay?” “It was great.” This was after I had left the military. I didn’t want to go back. I was twenty-four and just starting out in Hollywood. I was only a child and a teenager, but I had already experienced the most amazing, life-changing experiences of my life. I had the chance to do something and I took it. I worked a lot on my performance when I was young: I made a living playing the villain for TV, appearing in films like the evil, bloodthirsty, psychopathic Tony North. In one episode of The Sopranos, we were shooting on location in the middle of the Jersey City shantytown just north of the Port Authority of New York and the City of Brotherly Love. The street was full of abandoned homes. The residents of the shantytown, some of them were Jewish—they were the worst in the land. They were the most destitute and least safe people in the world. But, for some reason or another, their people, the Zulu, came up to us and said, “Why is this so interesting?” “Well, in Africa you don’t have guns. And guns protect people. In Africa people don’t own guns. People hunt wild animals. In Africa you never know where you’re going to run into a predator. So if you don’t have guns and you don’t protect people, you never will. And the last thing I saw is a world where they are safe again. I thought that was a dream come true. Then I learned something really shocking: In South Africa, the gun-lover in me was dead. I was never going to be a man of anything. If you wanted to be an Olympic diver, you had to be a man of the beach. If you wanted to take a boxing lesson, the coach told you what happened to that kid, but the kid couldn’t learn anything. The only way to be an Olympic boxing champion was to fight against the best boxers in the world. If you wanted to become a professional wrestler, the coach told you where to get training. If you wanted to be a professional wrestler, you had to go to Japan. You had to make your way down to Europe, which took you from the United States to China, to the middle east. Then you went there to train there for years and years until it was time for you to leave that country and start again, only this time, there wasn’t a single guy around. There was only me, an individual who took the time and the courage for himself. I was the next best thing to him. I could change the world. But when I walked out that door I knew it didn’t belong there. All I could do was make it my home. I wanted to be at the center. I had one goal in life: To teach other men how it was to be a man in the street. That was my goal all along. My whole life, I never thought twice about this. I knew that what I was doing was the only thing that would have any meaning. I knew that when we went to Europe, we’d go to Europe with a group of men from the street. You could see it in their faces as they walked by as if they were waiting for us to show them just what it was like to live on the street—even if it didn’t always end up quite as they wanted it to. In Europe we could get our own cars, buy our own food, live our own lives. In South Africa, there were no cars or kitchens. If it came down to it, we went to the street and lived to cook in a community kitchen. We went to the street to sell our own house and the other people’s houses. We learned how to clean the land. We learned how to cook in the street—everything but our own food. As a child, I knew that no matter what you did in the street, there would remain those memories for a lifetime. So, on my mother’s advice, I learned to be an actor. My first job in the street was at a bar called The Black Lodge. I got my first acting role in a comedy called The Great American Diggity Party—a bunch of black people in a circle and the whole thing was filmed in black and white. That was the first time I had fun at the bar playing an African character. “The Great American Diggity Party” I found it funny, because it seemed like African characters were doing the worst work as American characters. The white person was on TV all the time, talking to uslike we were a bunch of stupid savages, which is not true. There’s nothing stupid about the American West. We have white people, white people who’re up in the mountains and playing games and doing all these things that’s never been done by anybody else in the history of the continent. If a black person walked into any of these towns in India or Africa today and just started playing games for fun—like that little game called chess—they’d kill their friends. No one would do anything. That was the American way. We got along, even as the other people around us were killing each other for sport. We’d play games together. We’d be in a room and talk about life. Then in 15-30 minutes we’d see some white guy with a bow and arrow. That was our thing. We played the game. If something went wrong, we played together. We’d both get our weapons and take our bows and arrows. Then we’d go back inside and hunt for food or whatever it was. And that was it. We didn’t fight. We didn’t use swords like real people did. We hunted like real men. Then we would go outside for a little picnic that was our thing. And that was it, my friend. We went hunting in India in my family. No one in our family had ever been out in the bush in their lives. My uncle was an amazing hunter. My mother and the four older kids, aunts, uncles, and cousins all attended the same private school. I was a special interest student. I didn’t know what special interest was. I couldn’t get in, but my mom told everyone what kind of special interest it was. She took all the girls out to the garden to have a picnic. There was no one in sight that could get into the yard. A group of people gathered and watched the whole thing. Everyone came together in one place, sat down on a piece of dirt and made a fire. Everyone cooked a meal together. It was something special. I grew up in a house of hunters, so this was my family’s tradition, my mother, my cousins, and my great-grandmother—my grandmother-in-law—the biggest bonfire pit in town. It became a family ritual at a young age; everybody knew where to go and who to be there. We took turns sitting around a campfire, burning all those sticks—rocks, sticks, all sorts of sticks. There were no fires or cooking utensils. We just hung out on the wood and listened to the bonfire. It seemed like everything we learned at home was going to help in our adventures. So when we were young we had a big fire in our backyard and we made a fire from those sticks. We lit it. We made a fire. And we had a backyard. This was our backyard, the backyard where we had all of our vegetables. We had a lot of vegetables. That’s why at the time—like everyone—my mom was the biggest vegetable eater that day. It was the day my cousin and a cousin from Cameroon were visiting, but my mother was the biggest meat eater in my life. She’d cook all of our favorite meats. She’d make everyone feel special. One of my cousins was a butcher. The other two guys made meat and chips. But my mom was all-natural. She was one of the few people who could cook from the ground up in a food desert or in a kitchen. I always heard my mother call the meat she cooked a delicacy. So that day at the kitchen we got to try some of what she was cooking. We had been told many times by my great-grandmother that her first job was to make food for people who could not do so for themselves, that they needed her to tell them what to do. And my mom would do that. When people in South Africa would go hungry they’d go to her and tell her. And for the past eight years, my mom was there to help them do it. She didn’t let them go hungry. If someone needed help in South Africa they would call her, and for the price of a piece of bread—that was more than they could afford. But, as an example, I will tell you a little story: One day my grandmother was sitting at a table. I was seven, my cousin and my mom were all there. Everybody else in the house was eating their own lunch, doing what I used to do. One of my sisters ran over to get some of the kids a piece of bread, and it got to apoint where it was not enough. She brought me some for my brother. We went to buy some for my mom and my brother from the bakery. When I saw the bread, I didn’t tell her how sweet it tasted. I kept it out of the girls’ eyes. That’s exactly what happened when one day I was 11 years old and my mother took me in for Christmas. We’went around the house, all dressed up in my father’s favorite Christmas tree. The tree itself was covered with white and red and blue and green ornaments, and we hung it from the ceiling. As we waited for my mother’s car through the village to come by, we stopped by the bakery. The bakery was so small. We didn’t have anything. But I found something that my grandma had always loved from the time she started working in that field to this day: the cookies. These were the kind of cookie you could get at a restaurant or a bakery if you wanted. These were the kind of cookies my grandmother would make for me. They were always homemade, only slightly sweetened for the kids. You could buy them just as they were: the kind of cookie that would make the kids want it. But my grandmother made them herself. I remember them as the kind of cookies that made me wish I was a girl. That was the first taste of the real world. I was always a girl who wanted to be a boy, a boy who wanted to be a girl, a boy who wanted to be anything. And my dad was always there for me and every step of the way to help me get there in life. When I was a kid, every day my parents left for work, my brother stayed behind and I went along with him until my mom came home. At that point I started to understand a little bit about what it was like to be a man in a world that didn’t care for men. I started to understand that there were some men in this world who didn’t even have the right to defend themselves. That wasn’t my mother’s idea of a feminist country, and I wouldnT have wanted to be one. But it worked for my family, and it was the greatest thing that ever happened to us—the first summer I came home with a mom who wasn’t afraid of the elements. I was able to find my mom, who had always been a lot more protective of her kids than even her mother had been. We had the best relationship I has ever known—and even with those years that didn’t work out so well for our marriage, when things didn’t get great, when it turned out that the kids weren’t all that happy, that the problems we’had were some combination of everything, my mom would do everything possible so that my kids would be better off, and then I came home from work every day and looked in her eyes, and saw the same strong and loving and caring man who took on all the family’work in the house when my mom’s other children were out with the kids. It was my mom who took on the work, helping the children—and me—with the household. She didn’t take it easy. She never demanded to be seen, and I didn’t do enough to stay in the house because we didn’t feel like she was there all the time. I don’t think my mom was afraid when things didn’t go right with us in the past, either. If something had gone wrong, she would forgive whatever, even if the next morning it wasn’t right where it needed to be for her. But then the next day it was something even better than right where it needed to be for her. I know it doesn’t look good, but for the life of me I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t me that got hurt first. I didn’t care for men. I don’t have any female friends in my life who are around me in the same way that I do. My oldest sister, her family, and our whole neighborhood was so misogynistic that it broke my heart to see my father take such an aggressive approach to protect his family that day. I don’t think the fact that my dad was an abusive man had anything to do with my own problems—and maybe it didn’t help that I was the first in my family where you didn’t learn how to be an adult. My dad was always the last one out. When no one was around to make a play for you, he was the last to know what was going on, and the last to askany questions. He was a real man's man, but he would say in my ear, "No, it's not nice for my father. Let's get it straight. You're a racist." He knew what he was saying; we all knew what he meant, but if the way you said it didn,t sound too good, he knew that meant you were right all along. When we were in my late teens — well, my mom would say we were in our early teens; my father was on my side — my stepmother took me with her to visit him as a baby. I remember standing in the bedroom when my mom stood me up in her arm when he turned four. My stepmother had never been married before, nor had I done anything particularly special for fun. There was just something about my dad that I sensed. He loved his people. It was never our intention to marry her: My dad thought it would be a good idea to have her take care of my stepchildren instead. I remember my mom saying something about the only way to be a good person is to be like our forebears, which meant that we couldn’t get married, but she’d done that for me. There we had it. In my early twenties, I was starting to really grow like crazy. One night my stepfather came home from work, and for the first time in years I was really excited. I sat next to him at his kitchen table as we had dinner and listened to them talk about their lives and what they knew, and one of the topics of conversation that night was the Holocaust, and he asked me, “Do you know how to be a Nazi?” I said, “Yeah. That’s cool.” He didn’t know any better. The thing he really knew was why he couldn’t be a good father. “Why not have a better life doing something, doing something more useful to society than being a father?” I had never seen anything remotely positive or inspiring about the way my dad was raising me, so whenever his words caught my ear I was the first person to jump on the internet and find some sort of explanation. Every time I listened to his words I became more and more hopeful that all I needed, all I needed at least, was one more person to tell me what really happened. He was so good at that, too. And he was also such a good listener. I had a great relationship with him. I knew what he believed, and I knew what he wanted. If we had one thing going for us: that one time we got together and we talked about something, and the thing clicked. You could tell he loved to listen. But on my wedding day his reaction to me asking him anything wasn’t what you’d expect. He wasn’t even sure we’d done talking yet. I was so nervous. One morning, I walked into my dad’s office. It turned out he’S had a bunch of things from my kids that he wanted to ship off. We had all sorts of new clothes, toys — everything the kids wanted. It didn’t make him any more fun. There, at least I had something he cared about. One day we were hanging out by myself in his office and he said, “Can I please help you? You need some help.” He picked a bunch of little kids up and took them all to have lunch. He took them all for some kind of family dinner. He came over and sat down on the arm of the couch and started talking. He didn’t really have anything to say, just kind of explained the whole time. I was a wreck, confused and confused, but I knew what was coming. It was almost as if he wanted me to keep looking at my family and me, but I wasn’t listening, so he could say whatever the hell he wanted. But it wasn’t working out. We were having a really good time, but I never felt like my dad took responsibility for any of that good times. There were other good times. And then one afternoon one day he wasn’t even there anymore. He hadn’t come home at all. I felt like, Who’s going to take care of my family? “Dad.” All I could think about was, Is that it? At least my dad is the one who took care of us every morning? So was my mom. I wasn’t ready for anything else. The only way to get it done was to do what my dad did — make the impossible possible. He helped us find the time, he taught us to work harder and harder,no matter what the weather was, and we were the best team the whole country had ever seen. My dad worked harder and had longer days than anyone else. But he never once talked about quitting. He did the opposite. In the summer holidays every year we were the best team the whole country had ever seen. Everyone was on the floor playing that night — the greatest game we ever played. Our house went up in flames. One of the first things my dad did when he got back to his home in Nong Khai was he set up this amazing, custom-built, five-minute guitar. The guy had all of the tools of any traditional American musical instrument: a mandolin, a stringed instrument — a guitar, of course. He set it up in the living room, and we played all the time, not just the night before the big game, but at every other night of the year. There was one other rule that my dad didn't follow: Don’t let any woman play the guitar or the strings before you or anyone from your family at least. The reason it was a rule was that women had to have some special talent behind them. And my mom had some magic in her eyes. So when my mother gave you a guitar, you knew right away that it wasn’t going to be your dad’s. My father never let it be that way. She was a master at it. She was the world of rhythm, blues, blues, and everything in between when those other guys were just standing around doing songs and playing. I can remember when she turned 21 years old, when we got married. Then, one night, one morning, my mom was watching a video of a group of dancers, and in the street outside the group’s house, right next door, there was a naked man in a bathing suit, and he was really hot. That was the end of the world as far as her going in. I mean, I knew my mom would never do that. I’d do anything for my dad. But for this guy to be so hot, I had no idea what was going to happen, other than that it was totally cool. I always thought, My god, if I could have one day with this guy, I don’t know what it was going to be. So I was always the center of attention. But that day I didn’t want to be so close to my dad, that I didn’t think it was cool. And the fact is my father wasn’t the only guy in that video that made me want to get naked. That’s what I was drawn to, that video, the naked guy, the whole experience. I had to look it up and see exactly what the deal was. My mom had a great body for an 18-year-old — a little bit of a round figure, but the kind of physicality that can make or break you as a woman in America. The whole time I wanted to look good, too. My whole life I used to dream of having a real beach body because of that. I was a child of the '80s, but the beach looked like an airplane crash site, with no sand or gravel for sand to break off on. I used to run around with sandals all day, and when I got home I would go up for a dip and put my feet in the sand in this little patch of sand and just run around on the beach. Sometimes, I would catch a few rays and rub them up and down the sand, get some sun on my bare skin, and then put those on. I had never felt so good in my life. I was so ready for a full moon. But to have the coolest man on earth, the most beautiful woman on earth make me feel uncomfortable? It was one thing for me to see myself in the person of my favorite athlete on television, Michael Jordan, and it was another thing altogether for my parents to make me feel ashamed and ashamed. I remember one night, I was really starting to get into my rut as a young adult, one night we were all at dinner and my dad came out to have a drink. This was the summer that Michael’s basketball team, my favorite team, won a national championship, and I couldn’t help but be a part of it. My dad was a terrific ambassador for the NBA's mission to create a more inclusive world for everyone. For the first time in my life, I felt like I had an outlet for expressing myself and growing as a person. After talking to my mom for a while, she suggested to him that I join a sorority. It turned out to be a wonderful way for him to get to know another woman. In thatyear or so, I never went to another girl's dance, didn’t go to their house, and didn’t do any other female-female activities. That year, my mom had one more thing in common with my sisters than just the fact that they were all single at a certain point in their lives. My grandmother, my great-grandmother, was my great-great-great-grandmother. Like them, my grandfather was deaf. Like him, my mother was deaf. Like him, my mother’s mother went blind. It was my Grand Mother who taught us how to be independent adults. As an adult, I wasn’t seeing her as a role models. My grandma had two daughters. She had two more daughters like them, who went blind, and she was my stepfather’s only surviving relationship with anyone in her extended family. My dad couldn’t take any of it. He’d be a total stepchild. So when I came out, I was like one of those gay kid at recess who couldn’t be touched. One day my grandfather came home from work and found out about my coming out and offered me a place of refuge. He gave me a new room where he and his wife, the mother, would stay overnight, and he was so excited that he decided to let me stay. I didn’t take it because I didn’t have a place to stay—I was just staying in his house. The first time I hung out in our little two-room, two-bathroom apartment, I wasn’t wearing any panties. I didn’t know what a bra was. I was like, This is so cool. But the day we hung out, my mom brought out my favorite dress shirt: the blue-and-white shirt that my great-grandmother bought at that department store. And when I saw that it had my name on it, I knew something wasn’t right. This was a girl I really didn’t want. It was my mom from an early age, the daughter of my grandparents, so everything was perfect for me. I was one of the first boys her age to grow up with my grandfather. He’d be with his parents for the first six months until they were ready to get a divorce. Then he’d take her out, and we would hang out, and talk about our lives, until they were ready for her to leave. I remember walking the streets of Jerusalem for the first time in the summer of 1987. I was nine years old. A friend of mine from Pakistan in the U.A.E. called me into his house, and as we sat on the couch, he pulled down the picture of the baby I was holding and showed me the little girl in her mother’s arms. I had never seen her since. It was a little baby that I had never known, but I knew from the moment I saw the picture that it was going to be my mom's: A beautiful, white, round baby doll in a pink dress with a white little bird in her mouth, and the wings were blue. I was taken aback, thinking, A white baby? A white baby? I did not even know what the term meant. As soon as we saw each other, the two of us immediately got along. The dress and the bird were the only things that had changed; our lives had always been the same. Then there was the white kid. I got an inkling that something was not what it’s cracked up to be. But, at the time, I didn’t think any of the white guys in my life were as funny as they were funny. They’d joke way too much, about their wives and kids and all that. I had a good, solid laugh. I would have a good smile, too—but that would never be funny in a restaurant. The way my mother and my other siblings were raised by their mothers was the same as my father's, except here my mother was an independent woman who never let anyone interfere with her in any way, whether we’d want it or not. The first time that mother and daughter had an argument, my mother would get angry, and as a kid she was just as strong as he was. So every time they’d argue my mom’s way back would come up with the most ridiculous defense you could imagine for what was happening. "What’s the big deal about them divorcing? Look, this is our family. We don’t need to spend any time with them. What do we have today? We don’t have any children with them. You're not going to make anymore kids with them. If you think that somehow you are special, that nothing matters beyond yourself, well, you were the one who said it. You are the one who was misunderstood, and I hate that. But I know your life isn’t special—the lives of most people you’d meet were the sum total of who they were. So I will tell you the truth: I never really thought of you as an outcast from the rest of the world. My family doesn’t hang out with people on other continents. Our food is imported. Our clothes are manufactured in other countries. My mom, and my two sisters and my brother, and my grandfather are all immigrants here by birthright. We’d go to a Chinese restaurant every Monday night, and my dad would sit down with our food, and I’d be the only one eating. And the menu would be all of the traditional Chinese foods, but we could also have a few choices at different parts of the menu. At one point the Chinese menu was only American. My mom said if my kids could afford a good Chinese restaurant on a regular basis, maybe we would have a restaurant. That was my mom’s idea, though she wasn’t exactly supportive at the beginning. We never went as far as, I think, eating out, but the kids still got the best Chinese food, so it worked out for us. You know what would have been really great for us to do? I would have been so happy and content and content at home, and my mom would have given us a whole lot of money and a wonderful life as long as we stayed like crazy and never did anything else but Chinese. That would have been our version of the American Dream. It would have been like the best thing my mom and my younger brother ever did was buy me one of those luxury sports cars they had on sale for $200,000—a Ferrari. It was the coolest thing you were ever going to get, and it was only $200,000. It was a Ferrari, so it was a Ferrari. I remember when I was eight years old, we’d go up to that Ferrari dealer’s to meet with them and get one of the new ones, an Aston Martin—a rare, high-spec car. One evening we’d walk into their driveway. They were in the middle of the night, their street lighting was turned off, and they had just one electric light to plug into. I was the youngest and the most impressionable. I was very excited to be there. We saw the car. There were all kinds of cool things inside. And at that point, my parents felt they needed to step up and do something to change this, that life was just not for them. We didn’t see a way they could save me. What they told me was that they knew I had talent. They knew it was in a different league than theirs. It was a big moment for me when they gave me something to say. I remember being told all this. At first I thought, Why would anyone give a kid a chance like that? And yet, over time, I found myself feeling like a failure if there wasn’t more talent in my life. As I matured, it became clear to me that no matter how good some people were, if they didn’t do something about it, then people were going to take it away from them. It was the only explanation I had: I didn’t earn it! I got more from someone in their life, through their life, to give for me, and that person gave me their life to give. The only way to keep from drowning in my own glory was to act like I didn’t have one. Because, in a sense, I was a failure. Because I came in with the most incredible gifts. At times, that may have meant the most suffering because it gave everyone an opportunity to see the light. But the truth was, I wasn’t ever an athlete. The only thing that got me to be a basketball player was the fact that I could play basketball. I wasn’t even good enough to play basketball. I wasn’t even good enough to go to the gym to work out to get in shape or anything. As soon as you start doing it, all of a sudden you can do it. I got my first taste of this after I was ten years old. My cousin, our friend who was my uncle, came to me one day during our time together in the hospital when I was in my early 20s. As the hospital was in a bad spot, I’d come over and visit my uncle andI’d tell him all the horrible stories I had read of this man from the news. He’s such a nice guy, but he’d tell me all the horrible stuff. I couldn’t understand it, so I sat down on the couch, read a chapter of one of those books and sat there, waiting. I wasn’t reading it—I was waiting for the book to come on. I was in heaven. I was with my uncle, a man who loved me and my family. He helped me to learn how to love. It was not long before he became a complete stranger to me. One Sunday, my mother, who didn’t know how to cook, came in to cook for the family. The day before this, my dad had come home from work, and he had brought back this amazing salad with all the ingredients he had made for me. The first thing my mom cooked that week was a salad full of kohlrabi. I was the youngest, only five pounds, and I had never had kohlrabi before. I didn’t get any—the one I ate the most was this one. It was a green salad, but the leaves were green and the taste was so powerful: I could taste the raw vegetables. I was hooked from the moment I started to eat it: I could never put it down. It was a salad full of everything that I had wanted: vegetables, fruits, nuts. I was going to do anything in my power—cook, make kohlrabi—to get one of those delicious, sweet-tart vegetables. This salad would only last a month or so, but I didn’t think much of that. My dad was a man of his word. That meant everything. If you said no, no, no, I would never cook for that man again, but my mom was so passionate about cooking: We used to cook together every week, all summer long. And that was my dad’s favorite meal of the day: His favorite meal to eat is a meal he prepares every morning: A lot of rice, the rice that his relatives bring home to their villages. That will always be our dinner: They bring it to them, their family. Then they mix it up with their own dishes. I never missed it. But I didn’t get to share in the joy that dinner could bring. My mom got a job as a housekeeper at a restaurant in a different city. I’d never been to India, and the restaurant where my dad cooked for her was in the United States. At home—at home in the kitchen—I had no connection to the people on the other side. At home, I was the only Indian in the house. My dad’s cooking, his cooking, it was all for me. My mom was my only connection to the traditional Indian way. It was the only place where our people were very integrated into the customs, the culture, the social and political systems. I didn’t know any other way to connect with my father and the people on his block. So I was the only kid there. And yet here my dad became my best friend. We went on long walks together. Every morning, I got up for a walk, and he would be walking. He never stopped walking. We’d walk around, listening to my music in the background. Sometimes he wouldn’t stop for anything. In between us all was silence. Just the walk we’d be taking. In India, the kids walk everywhere. In India, I never went outside without my mom and my younger brother in my arms. It was my mom making me run because her son couldn’t walk fast enough without assistance. And I couldn’t bear going outdoors with him. At some point in my life, my mom thought that maybe she could make a difference. She convinced him that he could do more. So she set up the foundation—the first school for girls in the district that was dedicated entirely to educating girls. That was my first experience with what I’d call 'empowerment.' My mom taught me: “Women deserve to have more autonomy from their men. “I will fight to the death for the right of all women to take an equal share of that. I will fight to the death for it. And I will make sure I never let my men tell me what to do. In America today, that isn―t the way it is. If a man beats his wife? It doesn’t change the law. That man can get away with murder. It wasn’t until my middle school years that a woman came along who saw beyond that narrowmale-only, narrow-mindedness, and decided she wanted to challenge that. It was my first real test. There were no exceptions to this rule; men were born to earn, not to earn for women. If my mother didn’t give her children the respect the world was accustomed to having, then who knew what I would've done. What was my next step going to have been? I had always been the kind, smart kid who was the smartest among us. So when my mother taught me, I was in the thick of it. I took the SAT; took the ACT; everything else. My mother had all of my academic and social experience, and I was completely new on the scene. My entire year of public school was spent studying English and French at a prestigious college; that was the only time anyone asked me if I was good at either. There were few opportunities for advancement. I did well in school. My English teacher at school taught us that we had to study each day in one class from a time to time, so every morning after school we went up to the school's library to read what the rest of our class had been up to—that was the only option, really. At the time, I didn’t understand that. I just wanted to study. I spent my first semester in the library studying with people from all around the world, and for the first time in my life I felt like I had a purpose. And I learned two great things when it came to growing up in the city with my grandfather. We didn’t hang out in the streets. I had a very small backyard, and the grass was always greener, the grass was always safer, than the front yard. At any given time, for the most part, it was just me and my grandfather—and my younger brother. There were times I walked home on sunny days, my backyard, my grandmother telling me all the stories, and I would just walk down. The grass was always the grass was always the grass. This was my home, my childhood forever. I wasn―t allowed to play in the street. To be honest, I never had any other home besides this one. For the first time in my life, everything felt like home. It was just me and my mother and my sisters and my grandpa walking around, with our dogs, and enjoying the view of the city from our front door. I could have been on my own. The only thing I didn’t know is how much time my dad spent playing in the yard. It might have been less, but I didn’t know how much time it was worth for him just to hang out with the dogs. At least at that point in my life, I was in a happy place: the moment you take your first step outside the house with your parents, you become part of the family. It’s not like you can stay at home and take it upon yourself to take care of the kids. But here in the city where everyone’s been together for so long, you get to start, and then as your kids grow up, you leave and move out. At least that way you don’t have to worry about the children. You can take them to go play in the backyard, or you can go down and pick up the kids at school. I took them, because I felt like they were my baby. They were going to be a family. But that house didn’t feel like a family home. I had two big sisters, all living in a huge house, with no time for me to be with them. The problem was that my mom would take the kids to the park, and there wasn’t something to do. So I took the kids' toys, my toys, to school, to the park, to school with them. And I took the car. I took a minibus, and the kids could take the minibus. Sometimes I would take the minibus to school to get it to the park. Sometimes I would take the minibus to school in the school library. Sometimes it was just me and them running. I always loved that one time, walking home from school, I caught a glimpse of what could have been: three young black kids running after their mom, their younger, dirtiest, meanest, best friends. They ran after their mom! This was their world. My mom was my only safety, and I could go out and live the life and never worry when there was an intruder outside my house! But at least now I knew the rules. That was the first time a black person, in white people’s lives, was able to experience the horrors of the city in a way our kids couldnI went straight ahead. At night I was the same, scared every night, every minute of the day. In the morning I was in bed, still scared and ready. By noon it was all over—a day I never wanted to live through again. But there it was. I’d made that decision I’d made long ago. I was done as long as I ever could have and was never going to see that day as the last time I was scared. I didn’t know anyone would forgive me. I didn’t take it. I didn’t hold a grudge against anyone. No. I got on with my life, and, for the first time in my life, I felt like something was happening, not just for myself, but for the whole world. A few months later my parents met one of their first marriages of a lifetime: their first child, their daughter. The baby was born in their backyard, outside the town square and the park where our family used to walk and skate. My father got to spend a week every summer with her. My second year, I got an older brother, who’d have his own life to live, his own family. I’d have to work with both, but my brother and I were going to be the best of friends. I didn’t want to end up with a broken home. I tried hard not to let that happen to me. I wanted everything. My brother came up and helped me with that. It was really great. I could go hang with my brother and my sister in Jamaica—they were the closest thing I had to a traditional family of their own. I didn’t have to worry about growing up in a house of my parents and one of them, not my real parents, but a bunch of people who were trying their hardest to hold down a job and a lifestyle. My mom went from house to house getting people to agree to change their names, change their names on their IDs, and change their homes. That was the best job in the neighborhood, even though I had a choice of jobs at my dad’s company, which was to be like my father’s uncle—the only job in the neighborhood that wasn’t to do anything. It was like a black version of the white man’s-man power. The only way my dad wasn’t the best, he wasn’t the best. But the best thing about my dad was he never once called me back and said,“Hey, we can make that work.” Not once. I had no reason to feel guilty or anything. My dad was always the guy who was out there and giving. If he could just be the best, we could do anything. When my mom was pregnant with my grandchild, I was the one with everyone on the team, from the coaches to the players to the trainers to the players, the ones making the decisions. I was there in the kitchen, with my mom cooking, talking to a few of her friends, sharing my father’s philosophy. It was my family. I could talk to my dad the entire time, every day. But when you need to get a guy on team. And that didn’t happen for any reason except for our little things. Sometimes my dad told me not to ask for an interview and not to say anything until I was sure all the players were on board. That was the first lesson my mom learned. One night my best friend, a kid from a different era, pulled a .357 on me. It was a black-powder revolver. This guy kept coming over and asking me for the keys. So, this one time, I was like, What do I know? I thought that would be the end of the discussion. It didn’t help that when my mom came home from work, she was drinking. She’d drink so much she got to the point where she was going back and forth from a bottle of Jack Daniel's for her mother to some brand new Bud Light for us for a night. It wasn’t long after that when she took another drink and she took a small amount, too. I remember that night vividly. I was in a state of shock. I looked up and I saw two young people sitting on a stool outside my dad’s house. My heart sank when I saw them. The first thing I did was turn and run inside, where my mum, who was sleeping in in one of the living rooms, would be right behind me. I started crying. I had no idea why, but it just became me. I couldn’t help it. It was a great day.“You know? A kid I know is going to have a bath?” “No, that’s not something I’d ever done before.” The kid was ten and the bath was for five years. I loved it. I liked it. The bath was clean, no one in it. We did it twice a week, after school and during the day, so I didn’t feel obligated to take it. The boy had a small kitchen in the back. There was always a pot and a plate. So you could clean it, cook for it, take a bath, and then go and get dressed for work. That was the one day I made my choice: I went home. We cooked for myself, my mother, and the kids on our own. I would get up at five in the morning and go up to bed. That’d be my last day out. After that, I couldn’t go back to school, because it was over. In the afternoon it started all over again, with me taking it upon myself to help clean up after the kids, because, after all, this was the house. I started doing the housework. In the backyard, I set up a chicken coop. I made a pond. And that’s where I was going to spend my free time. Every Tuesday, I’d set out to make something for my mother. A chicken coop? Yes, it is beautiful. I was doing something? I’d rather not know. We’d talk about the birds for hours and still be the talk of the neighborhood. It was a beautiful day when I’d wake up in the middle of the night and I couldn’t go to sleep. The whole neighborhood had gone to bed that night. The street was dark and I couldn’t see where I was, and I wasn’t really worried about it. Then I woke up the next morning to find out, like I was, exactly what had happened. My mother called me. “Oh, hello, darling. I wanted to give you an update on what happened.” “We had an argument.” “Really? No’s what I said. Why not just call me.” “No problem.” “No problem. We can. We really can. Don’t be embarrassed. We won’t be. You guys know where to find us. I’d just been getting a lot of stuff from the internet that night. I didn’t want to have to do so.” And that’s how it was forever, ever, ever, forever: I was an internet troll. I had no interest in helping any of my neighbors. I was a complete asshole. Not even the cat. I felt like that was my responsibility as an adult—that I’d have an important role to play within the community. The only time any of us ever got to hang out was on a regular basis to hang out, eat and laugh. One night I was just a total troll, but I had a little too much in me to let it show on the Internet. It wasn’t too obvious what happened that evening, but when it came to the cat, it didn’t go well. After the party, my mother sent me one of those messages to tell me that it was time for some company. I took a quick look at the cat and I knew I wasn’t making any friends at all at home. But the cat was different. The cat was my best friend—the most loyal, most important friend. So when I saw my new friend at home, one evening I knew I could do something. I went to look outside the house to see what the problem was, but the only one I saw inside was the other cat. It wasn’t a cat at all: It was a dog. It was a Labrador Retriever. The dog I’d been training for years didn’t even like me. It didn’t know why he wasn’t in the yard. I tried to get the dog to come outside, but the dog was so used to its owners around here playing with its toys when it didn’t seem like it was having any fun that the dog just sat there and stared at the house for hours, staring at everything. I finally figured it wasn’t worth it. That was the first time I tried everything—being me. I was in control. I took the dog outside, and for the first time in forever, Isaw how crazy it was, how wild I was. I never wanted dogs like them ever again. But the first time, I felt that freedom. And I never felt that freedom ever again. I wasn’t happy, that next day I went inside and got another dog in the driveway, and so did my granddaughters. They were the same way. We were the happiest family on Earth. Then a neighbor came outside and pointed out to me an old house that wasn’t there. It was a house with no electricity. What the heck was going on? The house had power from the utility companies back in the day, and they had a network into every neighborhood in the city. People would sit in their front yard and turn on the water to flush the lawn. It was a nice little house, but it was so dirty that I never used to use it there, because I knew from day one that it had the most filth in it. The street outside the house, in my backyard, was the filthiest there had ever been. It was so filthy, in fact, that I never went outside. I went outside, which meant that the city had to plug the house in from the outside. It was a terrible, terrible idea. I thought to myself, I might as well just stay put and get used to living in this terrible, disgusting, rat-infested, human-infested mess for the rest of my life. I knew one day I was going to have to go back. And that day, I was going to be in the right place at the right time. I was going to do what I loved best—protect the earth. So that was the plan all along. We built our own dirt–and grass–and cobble–and stone–and tile–and brick–and paint–and wood–and electricity. It was the single biggest leap forward in life for us, and it didn’t even have to be done today. I was the youngest kid in school at the time. As a child in the early years of my life, my entire existence was surrounded by the greatest, most powerful men. I was not a girl. I wasn’t exposed to women or children. I didn’t know what it used to be like to be a man. But as a boy I found my father to be one of the greatest, most powerful men I had ever met. In my world he was the only man on Earth who was always right. So it was for all of us that I was the only boy in a girl classroom. That was just part of the reason I always got the best grades and never asked for more—I knew he gave my mom everything. I learned to do what she wanted, and the more she did, the more I learned of my dad, and he did the same. At least for my life. It went without saying at the time that I wasn’t allowed to play with dolls for her to play with. We didn’t have a car at home for her kids, or any other kind of toy for them. No other male in the home would drive any of their toys. And when they asked their mom what they needed for a special day, she was always the best answer. That day I went to a boys–only school for boys in the city. There I was the lone black girl in my classroom, wearing pink skirts and pink and purple and blue polka dots and doing princess dance lessons and everything in between, the entire school playing with my dolls. My mom and my brothers and all of the other boys all loved doing those things for me. They were my whole world. It was an extremely segregated school. As a black girl you had a problem. A black boy would run toward a white girl and say, “Hey, white girl!” That white girl had to jump back. The guy would not back. The white girl would have to run back and forth, and the white guy would take off his hat and show her his. That white girl couldn’t move. So white boys just ran toward the white girl and the white guy would run away, the white girl running like madman. That’s what the black girl did. It was her ability to move that was incredible, like nothing I've ever seen or experienced. It made so much sense to her. It was her natural reflex. She didn’t change. We never talked about it. She was her own person, her own. I was just a part that was there to do a job. I couldn’t stop listening to her stories—not my stories about my school, the things that didn’t go right, the things that didn’happen. But I got the sense that no matter what we did, if she wasn’t there and it didn’t work out, something had. “What happened?” “No. I didn’t get to know any other people. There weren’t any friends in my life. There wasn’t anyone to do anything for me anymore. That was goodbye. That was the end. I was done as a boy. I was done with being the little red dog. That day in school had ended the way it usually did, I thought. But in the months that followed, one day my stepfather gave me the worst gift he could have given me. He gave me his phone number and the address. I had the phone number. I was an instant number–a quick call to him and he would do anything I asked. He would call, he would come—and we made plans to hang out after school for a few drinks. Once it got dark and I was alone, I asked my mother. If I could get my father to help me track down that new girl at school. Then I was going to be my own man. “If he’s at least going to do what I ask,” she said. “Yeah.” That was the end of my fears about my father. My mom was so convincing and the way she went at him was the way any man would go at any woman. I became so much a part of her life that night, and I never looked back. My dad became one of her best friends. So when our lives diverged, when it got uncomfortable and I needed someone to talk to, there was no one to listen for me. I was too young for a father figure—my father was the older guy in his family, and his role models were my dad—and, by extension, his brothers. My mom took the reigns, but I took the reigns myself. I took over at home and became the bestest little girl on the block. We started hanging out at the mall. “Hey,” the older one would say, “what do you want for Christmas?” I replied, “We’ave a tree,” a very simple, very straightforward response. But by the end of the month that tree had been replaced with another one. I loved it. I loved the look of the new one, but it wasn’t enough. It was never going to be my tree. What were we going to do, hang out, take a stroll, and have a tree? We didn’t know. Then one day my mom came into our house and said to us, “I want you to buy a real one. I want it to stand with us. I want it to say that your parents are wonderful. I want it to come out on Christmas Eve. It’s yours.” My parents were completely oblivious to how crazy that sounded. I was too young to understand what the problem was, how much my mother was going to like it, and how much it was going to hate me. After a few months my mom bought us our first real tree. That one was so big we hung it from our house and we grew it and hung it on our balcony. We used it during the summer break from school as a makeshift Christmas tree outside the school. In those days, I had no friends. The one night my mother invited me over for a few drinks at home, I was all alone and I was too drunk to do anything. At least I wasn’t. That morning my mom asked me what I wanted for dinner. I was the best cook in the house but I lacked any other skills or a skill set. My mom, the mother of all cooks, had a great deal of experience that I could get my hands on and get the job done. But I knew nothing about cooking. I was a child of the American dream; I knew nothing. I hated everything about America, from the government to the media, everything. I hated everything. I came home and saw my mother, crying in the street. I was all alone in my house with no one to console me. In a moment that had never happened to me before, I was at the tipping point of my life. Then the other kids came home from school and told me, “We want to be like your mom” and they started making their own version of the mommy triangle, and I started seeing how much of it I was on the outside and how much of my life I was on the inside. Every time I tried to do something for my family, the other children werecoming down and hitting my mom across the face with sticks. I remember them telling my mom every night, 'Mom, the kids are going to beat you at the playground. We're never going to have fun any more. You're going down to the basement. There the kids will beat the adults. You get out before the kids finish beating the adults.' Then my mom made it the rule for all her children—and all my neighbors—that there would always be a place for kids in the backyard. At least, that's what we told our little kids—to go up when other kids came down. I remember my cousins—and everyone in our family—walking down the street with plastic buckets to clean up when others came out. At least my family was clean. In my world I was the dirtiest person alive. The children had to go play. In my world, it just didn’t work out that way. At one point in childhood my mother got me a new set of clothes. Every single day our whole family wore the same pair of pants or something. The most beautiful colors, the most beautiful patterns—nothing but white. At least my mother was the housewife, and she took me under her roof and taught my life how to be a good family. That was something that all women in India were missing: a woman who wasn’t dependent on others for anything. There were no second jobs, no daycare, nothing like it in India. My mother understood that women needed independence and control in their lives, and that when those women became independent and self-reliant, society as a whole would embrace them for that. At home we lived in a house on her back. She had a huge backyard, too. There. There was always someone who came around who could use the backyard. Then there was everyone else who didn’t get to play in the backyard, either because they did not have the house or because it was too small to support one person. It was a perfect, perfect day. A big party, everybody from my grandmother, grandaughter, our aunt, my great-grandmother, my grand-uncle, my grandmother, my great-grandson, or whoever was there, playing all day and partying all night. I was six. It was the biggest celebration you could ask for. I was an incredibly happy, productive, productive teen. At least the other girls in my mom’s circle, though, they were always in it for the long haul. I had my mom buy me my first car—a small, one-ton white Ford Focus—and the first thing she gave me that day was this huge, black-and-white sign that told me that I was the coolest black kid in the whole hood. That meant, I was a total badass in the hood. I knew from an early age what it was like for black people to be denied a second chance at something they have had all along. The sign was a warning: The moment I get caught, your life will be over. My mom said it would take at least one night to realize I had something. Then she told me to get the hell out. It wasn’t right; it was terrible. But at least you know that at least, sooner the better. So when I saw this sign, I knew the first thing to do was get out. I figured I was a hero of some kind, and now I was gonna get revenge on somebody. I didn’t understand what this was about. It‚s the white cop on the corner who stops us. Who stops us for no reason at all? There was someone waiting for me and I was not supposed to get close to him or give him any information. That person was my father, the white cop on the corner. All he knows is that white people are all about crime. I decided I wasn’t giving him that info. I was the first black teenager, the smartest kid on the block, so whatever. The white cop, realizing that I was trying to do something positive, pulled me aside and said, “You need to stop it.” He gave me a lot to bear. I was going around shooting guns, I was in the street selling crack, selling crack. For the first time I had one purpose: to make a real difference, one that would change the lives of black people. That’s when the revolution started. My life was a blur. After a few months of shooting guns out of my mom's driveway in her basement, the cops pulled me over for failing my sobriety test. I was arrested. The first thing the police asked was about my car. They wanted my dash-mounted camera. But as soon as I said that I knew what I was getting myself intoMy camera was a gift from a friend of mine to show his mom in his village. A few months later she called and said she had found it and wanted me to have it. I had it, the camera. It never came in. I didn’t have any money for an Internet connection at home at that point. The only option she had was to take it and run to our nearest phone line for her mom. The mom said, “I won’t use the Internet if I don’t have my phone.” I walked home from work, my wife in tow, my cell phone on the end of my belt, her mother waiting to pick us up. At home we found a house in the village called Baukeland. I had a small shack that we could hang out in the yard and play in the house. Baukeland is one of the easiest places in the world for me to be at home all day. Everyone lives in one flat, no running water. They have one-storey houses, and we live in another house on the same lot. I’d hang out in the kitchen, cooking a nice batch of pot-luck soup. I could run around, hanging out in the garden, playing games, going for a walk. Every morning my mom would get up and brush my hair and get me ready for school. I remember one morning there was a little fire in our yard. I was in the backyard and my wife noticed something was wrong with the grass. There wasn’t much. I wasn’t used to it. My wife put one drop of water in my mouth, and within two hours I was completely doused in it. The fire was incredible. A fire? What fire? Was this a forest fire? I couldn’t believe my eyes. I didn’t think people had any idea how bad it could be. It wasn’t a single house, so there couldn’t have been any smoke or anything that got out. We tried to put it out, but we never even had a chance. Then it caught on fire again. Then it caught fire again. For days, no one came and put it out. It burned so much that by daybreak it was like we had never had the fire in the first place and, at night, I’d go to bed alone. The next day, there was a huge fire around the house. The people in our community didn’t know what to do. Nobody came to our rescue. We were the only ones who could stop the fire. As the first day went by, it got worse. By the second day it was just a pile of rubble. By day three, it started spreading all over the house. There was no running water in Baukeland. There was nothing left of the house. In fact, for several days we’d only had one little piece of the charred remains of the house left, the one house we were renting to someone else. One day, the landlord decided he needed to get rid of it, and, for the first time in my adult life in my life, I wasn’t in any other person’s house. I wasn’t living with the family anymore—no one but my mom. I went back to my cousin in Kanojo, an area of northeastern Nigeria where there still exists a large and independent religious community. This cousin, Zainab, is a very good Muslim woman who leads that community. She is so strict about it that she doesn’t allow her children to leave the house without their parents present. They are never inside, except to go to bed at night. The men in her community are the only men in their family, and the women are the only women in any community. The only men in their community are the only men in their church. That is how Zainab, a devout Muslim woman, treats her men like the women she has always treated her men like. If I remember correctly, there was something about Zainab that made me realize to a fault that that was not a thing that I did in my life. All my experience with men in their churches had taught me that when women are in the congregation there is no longer a separation of church and government. Women are on the church beat, while the men in the church are working. But what I could not fathom at that point was that I had only a few years left. It was the first time in my life that I truly believed in the power—and the freedom—of being alone. I had the freedom that I couldn’t give up for a man who was older, better, stronger—just the freedom tobe myself. I had the freedom to walk in my own path. I did it so I didn’t give it away. That became a key in my life when, one afternoon, I saw a man with a gun in my back yard. He said to me, “Get ready, boys.” I thought. You could get me. Why not? At least there’s no one to hurt me? He’d made a deal in my backyard. This was my house. I knew that I should leave. One day I found myself walking down the street in my neighborhood and I stopped and thought a second. Maybe I should have stayed in my house and let my mother have that freedom. I decided to call my mother the next day and let her know what I had decided. “Mom, just do what you want—just do what you need to get through the day.” I couldn’t believe what had happened. My mother had always been such a strong believer in me, not only that I would have my mom be like,”“All boys should be boys,” but I always thought of myself first and my mom second. At least I knew I was the real me, the other boys didn’t need to be around me. And that, to me, was the point of my life growing up in the suburbs, where it didn’t get any different. That was where men felt comfortable with women. My mom was a big believer in my dad coming home after work every day to spend time with his kids and going through life with them. I remember those days being the happiest times of my life, and I knew what my dad would have to do to get me through it. I was always the only one on either end. But, after a while, I began wondering if this was all a facade. If I’d do what my father had to do to maintain the facade, I should do what’s right. That was the question on my mind and the thing I couldn’t answer. I knew the only way this would stop was if I stopped being a good baby. I started being a bad kid. I stopped being quiet. I started running around the neighborhood with loud-mouthed little farts. I started playing loud music at parties, not caring who heard or heard what. No one could hear when I was playing—not even my mom, my best friends, any of the other kids. That was when the trouble began. At school for the first time, my friends and I were called "boys." Everyone knew it, but it was not accepted. One of the first things I learned in seventh-grade was that if you tell people one thing, then you must do something to prove it. I knew no other kids my age knew it. We didn’t have any friends who were the same way. The only people I knew as boys were the people in my school. The only thing we did every day was get together at the library and pick up some books. My mom came over every single day to pick out my favorite books. And we all were reading and enjoying our books the same way we had every morning since kindergarten: The best children's books, the best children’s books and the best young adult books. But every one of them had a female protagonist, a white woman as the heroine. And I’d never read a book by a white woman. When I was in seventh grade, one of the first books I ever went to on library shelves was The Color Purple by JoAnn Wypijewski. It was a great book. But that night I was reading and my eyes just went right back to what the book was about—white people, white oppression. I could not believe the whole time. This was the book that told the whole story. I thought: This is what it was like for me to grow up at the center of all that white-on-white violence. But that morning in school, I was a different young man. I had no idea I was going to grow up like the white people in the book were. It was such a shock for me, but by the second semester I was writing this book I realized that my mom would never let me tell my story. She was never going to let me tell my story, and so was my dad. So I did what any white person would do. I made it my mission to prove them wrong. I decided that I would prove them all wrong. I began my journey on campus as an independent thinker. I began writing, debating, writing letters to a newspaper. For the first time in my life I felt like an outsider, a outsider who wasnot welcome. I was a total outsider, like, totally separate. At Yale this made life, and my whole college, seem like hell. I loved my friends, but they didn’t see me. I couldn’t talk about politics in class. I knew that my professors would not let me participate in any way in a political conversation at the school: not just any conversation; no debates, no debate shows. So the only way I ever could understand one another was to watch my professors discuss politics on our own time, in the classroom. I thought I was having one of those awkward intellectual moments. I didn’t want anyone else, even if I could. I understood that in order for me to stay in Yale, in the years ahead, I had to learn every single other day not just the rules, but the rules of the games. I had to understand, I knew, that in order and for the game to be played, each person must be prepared to make their own set of rules. At least that was the message my professors sent to our students. My life there was a series of frustrating, humiliating moments. One afternoon, a professor came into my office for an urgent email, telling me that the day the term was going to be up, all of my credit would go to his secretary. A couple of months into being a lawyer, I found that my only connection to society was my husband’s work at the law firm, a firm that took special pleasure in breaking all of the rules every day. I was a little confused: Why should he give my spouse a raise? Why not me? I told him — I wasn’t sure at all whether I knew how it worked or if I understood how the system worked well enough, that I needed to see if I could figure things out on my own. I was the lucky person in his office. If, however, I told him not to do that, we wouldn’t have much fun at all. That afternoon he sent this e-mail back, all in a day, asking that I sign on for some things that he would do — but, in particular. “I can’t approve this, as it is illegal. This, my friend, is illegal. This may not be legal in your state. If this goes forward, no matter what you do, your life as a lawyer will be over.” I knew that in the end, the only way out of trouble was to leave Harvard Law School. My friend and I set our sights on an alternative school in New Jersey. That was the closest we would get, an alternative to that big institution at Yale that had already given us all the trappings of status and privilege: a nice life, the best schools in the country, a degree. I knew I’d be one of those kids that went somewhere else after college — probably at the nearby town schools and the like, and maybe some day a big family with kids from another village would come to live in our backyard. I knew that if something were to come wrong in my family that I’d be the straw that broke the camel's back. I knew that if something happened to me after graduation my future parents wouldn’t accept it. It seemed like the last thing on earth they wanted to do would be a repeat performance of what had happened the first time, and they took the high road. “I don’t think we’d have a great future if we let it happen. We need to get our life together. Please, help your son out. Please, tell him.” I was devastated. It was the end of that first year in New Jersey, in the summer of '91. I was 17, and I was ready to leave. It was the summer of my first boyfriend, the year that my mother had a miscarriage, which left me with the burden of being around her and his other children. It was also the year that I was starting high school on a new mission: A mission to start a black nonprofit called Black Agenda: The End of the Government. I was going to be the face of that movement. So I knew this wasn’t going to be a pleasant transition. I already had friends I had established, and I knew they’d do nothing but take advantage of me for their own benefit. My mom and I weren’t leaving that family with them. We were going to do it our way, and at the end of the day I was going to be a part of it, too. I just didn’t know it yet. In the end, as the years went by, I began to realize what I would have to do. I couldn’t just stay in the house.I needed to be a professional in life. “What can I do to become a full time job?” My friends were all college kids in their 20s or 30s, but they’d been laid off, and they hadn’t seen any career potential in the meantime. They were all just hanging out because they hadn’t done anything. I knew that if I wanted to do that, I had to figure something out on my own. What kind of a life would I have? What kind of a job would I be doing? I’d been the most successful guy in my life. In that moment I had a clear decision to make. The question was, would I take that chance? The answer was always, Yes. That night I was so full of the energy of that night and the morning after it that I didn’t care what anyone gave me. If I didn’t have any kids, I would still be me. What was more important to me was the fact that, despite that night and that morning’s daydreaming, I was a real kid, too. This time I was the kid with no time. This time I had the drive to realize it. I knew now that the only chance in life for me to succeed was to make it for myself. That moment gave me something of an identity. It broke off a long chain for me: one day you have a moment of clarity and you realize where you need to be and what it takes to be in the world, another day you look back on that moment and it was like the day your Mom died with you, one day. You start over in a completely different place. It was that moment. What more could a kid ask for or get? What was there not a kid can do, and I’d gotten it? I had that moment. When I turned 14, I decided I had to learn how to be a man. I didn’t learn how to be a man. I learned how to be myself. My life as a high school student was like a video game: one character can be a monster and the other character can be a hero. One day, all was right with them. That first season in the NGA, my parents were at a crossroads. We told them: If you keep your children within the home, you won’t be paying any legal defense for the child's murder. That seemed like a fair deal for their children, for the children of their neighbors: they would get some family support and that was it. But at least we knew that they would be responsible for this one thing they knew best: They wanted children, too. My dad said if they could just get me a job at McDonald’s and stay busy, they’d be OK. So I got my first job at McDonald’s. That was about two months after I turned 14, and the only way that would ever work out was if I stopped making videos and started acting. The last thing I needed at the time was any kind of fame or attention for myself. My first job was to drive a cab in New Jersey. I couldn’t speak with any authority on the New Jersey highways; all I could do was make videos and play videogames to entertain myself. Eventually, I found my way through this little town that became one of the most popular on Earth. But at that point, all that video-game action was just another way it was for me to get by, and now I knew that I was not going to be as big in the industry as other, more famous people. I knew that it was time to take some responsibility, and, to make the most of that responsibility, I took the only job of all the jobs at McDonald’s. When my dad came home one night he wasn’t excited to see me. He said I’d been a little busy lately. This is how they always say: A man can be as busy as an elephant. I was the man in the middle. I got to be the lone wolf. If I couldn’t do that job and still get a normal job, I had made one poor choice — and that man had to make another poor choice. In the end, I wasn’t the lone wolf. I was the lone man in the middle. I took what everyone else was doing and went their way, without a second thought. “This is what you do when people tell you you are man of the hour: They take whatever you give.' “It was a nice little vacation.” It was a good vacation. But at some point my parents had to make a decisionThey told me not to go. We were both on a tight budget at the time, and not buying anything was a huge break in the bank. I stayed at the house, at my brother-in-law's, a small hotel. It was tiny, with a bed, no running water. We lived in a tiny shanty. We didn’t have electricity for the tap, no running water. ‹How hard are I going to take this,” they said. ‹We have a baby,” my mom replied. ‹No, no, we have to sell this house in order to make ends meet. To keep it.” It was a horrible moment in my life. A house and a child to raise and raise them. It wasn’t the most comfortable family in the whole of Brazil, the first place in the whole of Central America, the only place in the whole of South Africa that I had ever seen a woman married off. When it came time for me to sell my house, I knew exactly what I needed to do. I went for my parents to see their lawyer, who called their friend, who called their friend. The lawyer came back right away. “I need some money to settle the debt with my mother. But I don’t want to tell the family what we are going to do because that would make things worse for them. So I'm going to find some new lawyers.” “What do you mean? Who to hire?” The lawyer said he was a big deal, so the family had a meeting with him, at the courthouse. It was there, in court, that I met the man of destiny. One Thursday a year I’d get a call from my mom telling me that it had been decided she was no longer going to be with us. I knew at that moment what my life would have to be like, how much money we would have to make to move and get out of it: If I were a rich white man, why would I take my family to see the movie that had so much chance of being a masterpiece of cultural influence if I was the only white guy? Well, what would I do? I already knew it wasn’t a great decision. But for a kid from a small town, the prospect of getting to see that movie, on some level, seemed like such a great deal. I didn’t know what to say. I couldn’t even look her in the eye. That week of the movie I was a different person. I wasn’t having these thoughts that day that made my mom think that maybe I should be living with her in her house, so that’s what this was about, right? If I couldn’t go to see the film —”My mom”s movie. No, that’s not me. That’s not what I know of this movie. It’s not about the characters. No, that’s not what the movie is about. That’s not how the movie should be, either. “I want to see that movie for myself,” my mom explained to the judge. “But my mom doesn’t want to. Her feelings toward it have changed so much that there can be no doubt that it is a fraud. She’s sick of it. That’s why she doesn’t let anyone play and see the characters. If they don’t come for the movie, she will shut them down with a piece of wood on their wall." “My mother is so passionate about this movie. She said it was our duty not to give it a second thought, to just accept the script. Then there was one night that she made a surprising but necessary decision. The lights were turned off, and the lights were never turned back on again. In one night, the entire theater was silent, save for whispers of laughter. That night, in the middle of the movie, the last scene, everyone got together. And they all laughed uproariously. It was the greatest moment in cinematic history — no matter what happened during that movie. But for a moment, the entire theater was silent, and at that moment, I was the happiest person in the world. I remember that night like it was yesterday, like it was today, the very, very, very— a little before noon, but the entire movie. And the whole thing felt just like the moment before. Like the very, very moment, but with the same intensity. It was the night the camera clicked. The whole thing was captured with an eye-popping clarity, a quality I still get from every movie Isee. That one moment of lightning, from that moment at the gym, was everything to me. At the age of 14, when all my family was moving to San Francisco, I figured I wasn't going to make friends and I was going to do it on my own: go live in the rainforest of my grandmother. I started a new life on my own, living in my grandmother, her backyard. There was no electricity in the house. The electricity ran off the grid in the backyard to the nearest village. The only other people in the house were my two older brothers, my uncle, my uncle-in-law, my cousins. But my mom, being my mom, wasn't about to let me live outside in the dirt. Instead, she had me come back and work in her house, where I found a small, one-room shack just inside the fence, a small plot of land just over the fence line, a kitchen, a bathroom, a bathroom. But that's not the only thing she had to do to keep us all going. Every three days, we'd be up, running, playing in the yard, cooking, sleeping, then she'd get up and leave, and my brothers and I would be back inside the house, back to doing the same time and time again. In the meantime, all day, every day, the little house next door could be home to a family of animals. The same animals I had in the forest. There was no electricity in my house. The house was in shambles, and we couldn’t run anymore in the dirt. The only power that did work in the house was from the power grid down the street. It was a huge, bare, old, shaggy patch of land. We were just as poor as before: In the yard, there was nothing but dirt. On the first day, it looked like the whole neighborhood had gone insane: I spent the first days running around and playing in the yard, and people in the neighborhood were running around the yard and playing in the yard. And the second day was going pretty well. My mother was having me play with her dogs: She brought them in to play in the yard, just as usual. It was a wonderful time; for the first time in my life I had the chance to meet someone in real life who made me feel at home all the time. That’s when I started to feel like I could be like her. I got a puppy, and I was overjoyed to have a dog. I was happy to have a dog. I didn’t know a thing about them, except that they were super cute. I started playing with them all the time. Even when I wasn’t around to play, she would walk right up and cuddle up with a baby at least a half hour before I’d get out of bed. I remember the day that our dog was born. I had been playing in the yard all morning and all afternoon, and when I got home, I was the happiest person in the world, a very happy person. I was so much in love with this dog that the minute the baby was in the water, I knew. I just didn’t know what to do. My mom didn’t know what to do. I was the only child with my mom, and there was no one to take care of my younger brother. The two of them were together. My father had a job he was supposed to be doing, too, so he was home almost every day. My mother didn’t take care of her kids. I didn’t have another family member to take care of them. So from that point on, life was my mom’s. My mother had me and my brothers to rely on. From that point on, I had to learn how to take care of myself. I was an only child. My mom raised me alone in the home, not with her family. She never took us or my younger brother or the boys to get them either. I was their guardian. She was their role model. I was their everything. In our early teens, my mother became very protective. Every time my father got into trouble with one or another woman I had him back up. In other words, she could take it. She wouldn’t allow him back down. In truth, my life with my mother was all downhill from that day, with the only change being the occasional phone call from her. If at any point in time you could have called her directly, that would have been the day, in any case. She simply wouldn’t be in it for this. She had a different approach, more of a professional one, which I found completely alienshe was never a part of my life, or her, but in my mind it was always, She’s the one with the problem. “Why aren’t you taking a vacation?” She never liked being with the family. When we didn’t have any friends around, we would spend every spare minute playing video games together on the Nintendo Entertainment System. At night we’d turn on one of those games and go for a run. But then we would come back in the morning—and I’d wake up the next morning to another thing. That time it was like the game was on. It was a marathon from the house to the park for an hour, or an hour, or an hour. Then the game would stop and we’d go do some things. What the fuck?! Then we’d come back, play some sort of game. In those days, the kids in our neighborhood weren’t the only ones with a problem. The school that taught us English on a Saturday morning was the same public school—not the same state-run public school—that the cops were coming to tear down. Our neighborhood—the same street that was roped off into an urban jungle—was not the only place our English teacher could not speak English. She also couldn’t teach our kids an easy, American way to read. So that is where our English went in shambles. We knew not to speak the language on any level. If the teacher could speak English, she could. But what she could not do in English was write in cursive. We’d come home from school; my dad was a teacher himself. This was the time, my childhood friend says, that my mom told us: We’re out, out, it is over, we have to move to Israel. We moved into a shithole. My dad took our passports, our papers, and, for a while at least, our Israeli driver's license. They were all the papers our family needed to move to a small town to live in one of the best neighborhoods in Israel. But one morning, a group of people gathered outside, armed with knives, guns, and Molotov cocktails. The police showed up. They shot people; they burned down entire streets. My mom and my younger sisters went straight to their aunt and told her they were leaving. We were the lucky ones. I grew up with a strong-willed, loyal, and very strong mother. My mom fought for Israel. I was the brave and courageous kid that stood up for Israel; for my friends. My dad took a different path. And so, I took my dad for the last time, going with the gray line and going to live in a world that would have been my life, but—at least for my father—that world was not to be. My Dad got out of his life in a way that I never fully recovered from. I went down, my whole world was on fire. One night, I woke up on my Mom’s house in Israel; it was a Saturday, and it was almost midnight. The house had been packed to the brim with family from the American and international Jewish community. Everyone was packed into the living room, with our three children, my son, our niece Shimon, and Nana, my nephew Shai, and a dog, and my mom. There was my cousin. There was my sister, Rona, my sister-in-law, my mom’s mother-in-law. All of them. I was there from three months old. I’d been on my mom’s mind as of late, but she and the kids thought it was a good idea. Everyone was together during the prime minister’s visit, but they were still together, sitting at the table. During that visit, a few of the more radical Israeli Jewish women at the Israeli Embassy in Washington started calling on me to join them to take in their sons and nephews in a fight against the Palestinian terrorists who are destroying their country and their lives. My heart was full of grief and pain, but my mind was made up: It’s better to die and to live a short, painful life, if that is what it takes, just like it was for my family back home when they were slaughtered in a terrorist attack, or the way it was for them in the South African independence struggle. There is no question that if I had stayed home and been all alone, in my house, I could have helped protect my family in their time of need, but that didn’t happen. In my mind I was an extension of them, and a part of them,as they used to say, is me. This was their idea of what a dad should be—a man with a family—but in reality I wasn’t allowed to be one for one reason or another. My mother would get mad at me, the whole family—I knew I belonged with them. And then there was one night the day my dad came home from work, he got a call. It was only his third day on the job, but he had a message for me. He was getting married in a few months, and this was the first time he did something that would make me feel comfortable with him. He had taken my mother over to his house on his first day to live with them. They were having a great time and he invited her to stay for the celebration. I jumped at the chance. At least that’s what he was telling me. It was a big deal because, for the first time in my life, it didn’t matter that this was a dream, I wasn’t going to have an adult relationship with anyone. As long as I was growing up with my mom, there was no going out and having some adult conversations or even having an adult relationship. This was my life now, but I knew no one would change if I told them not to. So this was the first time in my life my mom really stepped up and helped make this happen. But even after that first date was over, the fact that this man had made me feel so welcome, in her eyes, was a small step. I was a bit overawed, as I wasn’t used to that sort of treatment, but it was a learning experience for me, as well. I knew how important it was not to put him on a pedestal. But that day I couldn’t be him. And after that I could have been anywhere I wanted and been a man in my own life without asking my mother to do anything. At least until I was in my late 20s. When my sister moved to Australia so we could live in a small house in a village in the bush, my mom was the main housemaid for our village. This means she was responsible for running the household. The children—all my cousins—were all her nephews. I’d grown up with them all my life. Now, I needed my mom to keep the house in order. I found a job out here in the bush as a cook for a local restaurant. But that wasn’t enough. My mother kept insisting on taking the kids out for all kinds of activities, from swimming and horseback sports to picnicking and playing in the back country. My stepfather, a very competitive man, would go out drinking with us, too, but my stepfather knew the difference between fun and competition. He loved this outdoor life. And one day in the bush, one day my friend Ben came home from work and was going out to grab a glass of water. He bought a big bottle and it was full of the local spirit—water. And it had a bottle of local beer in it. It was the first time I thought. For all its potential and promise, there were so many other, more wholesome and more traditional ways of life that I didn’t want to pass up. I was a new guy coming to a familiar old home, but I already knew that if I wanted to live that life, I needed to find a way to express it. It would be one thing if I chose to live out my life the way others have, with no children. But the only way I knew that was if I stopped having children. I knew that was what everyone was doing—everyone was going through the same thing. I was going to live a life based on that. So I began to look for another way. I began the process. I learned the dance. I learned how to get along with others. I learned the skills of a successful person. I learned how to be a gentleman. For the first time in my life I was able to feel like I was doing something worthwhile, something that meant something to those around me. That’s when I realized, no, that doesn’t have to be how I live my life. I didn’t want to become that guy. I’d grown up with those guys in South Africa. I was ready to learn. That’s when I began a yearlong journey into my secret life. It was a journey from the beach—where I was running around the beach in the sand all day to the men's storeroom. There is a line of men on that beach at any given time who look down and say, “Oh, yeah, I know everythingabout women. You should date this woman.” You hear the same stories all the time: A man tells you he doesn’t think it can get any worse. A man says he is scared to have a baby. A woman tells you the same story. The thing with women is that they know how to be better than men. They know the ways in which men take advantage. For example, one time I looked inside the man’s kitchen one evening and it was a mess. I had my lunch, and as I was filling my plate I noticed that the man who worked the kitchen—his wife was out of town on business, and they were living in the kitchen with a new kitchen. So he had set up a grill in the backyard, and this was the only thing that was working in the garage—and now it had been left to rot in the sun. So this new kitchen was the only place for the husband to cook, and my son was in the kitchen for him. I was in. I was the only one cooking. It was an odd thing, because our whole lives our families were in one house: Mommy-and-Pop, Dad’s house. They were in touch with him a whole lot, whether it was on their own or through aunts. But if I saw my son in that kitchen, I knew that life was not what it was cracked up to be. It couldn’t be that simple. The next morning, after my son was with the new wife’s family, we went up to visit. I had a feeling that things were different for the first time in my life. I could smell the food on the kids” table—the way their fingers were done. The food was good—but they were not eating anything like I knew growing up, or from growing up. I was hungry. But they weren’t eating anything I tasted. Maybe this was a blessing in disguise for me; maybe I’d eat more of the food they’d made, but the kids were still my kids. But if I wanted to, I could make them eat something I knew how to make as a child: Canned spaghetti with tomatoes. I liked their food, but it wasn’t until I started making my own that I realized that I loved the texture and texture just the way it was: The color, the meat, the flavor. At least, it would have stayed that way without any of those artificial ingredients and processed foods that were making us sick—but that was a long time ago, so I never did. Canned spaghetti, for one thing, didn’t go bad with any water. When I’d make spaghetti, I used a pot with a lid, but I only put about three-quarters of an inch of water in it. I had the lid on, as opposed to the other thing you get in these canned food stalls, the other thing is the salt. As a child, I loved to eat at family”s, a restaurant, like my grandmother, an incredible-looking woman, who was a stay-at-home-mom and a wonderful cook. I remember one time our table was full of all the food we grew up with. My mom came over and bought us all the produce from where we grew up. She took us all to get ready. My mom brought me a handful of tomatoes. I ate it. Then, the next time we went back to that restaurant, my mom brought me a salad. I didn’t know what a salad was until I was eight feet from the kitchen and ready to dig deep into its heart. After a while, there was nothing but tomato, the perfect balance of everything. And then I realized what a perfect combination of things that tomatoes had been since before my mother got pregnant: Not only was it the perfect tomato, it was one of the best-kept secrets at the restaurant that I didn’t want to share with anyone. I’d never learned the recipe. It was like the secret was that everyone was a secret, and I was the only thing you could share. But my mom would never let that happen. She believed in it all the time—not the least to this day. I am a product of her, and the way we lived, it was never about what I liked for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a cocktail. When a woman does this, it’s the most amazing thing she can do and it doesn’t happen in a day. But today, when my girlfriend told me I needed to find my birth mother, I knew it wasn’t going to just be some random stranger. It would be something I had to do, and it wouldbe something that no one else did. So this morning, I went to my mom’s house and looked at her living room. A few pieces of her house were still standing, and one piece of the outside was completely gone. I wasn’t too upset. She had a young family and a home that was as nice as the inside. The inside was pristine. I was just about ready to do the deed when my mom told me to get the keys. I was a little scared. But in a year, I was going to be the biggest jerk in the world, and nobody was going to know the trick—so I didn’t have to be. I ran upstairs, and the only thing I saw was the old man hanging from the ceiling—the only thing in his life that made him special, and the only thing the kids who loved him were going to know for certain was that. It was like they were watching a different person play the piano, but there was so much difference between the two of them that I was never going to play that piano. Then a couple hours later my mom came back. She told me, “You know, today is a lucky day today. Tomorrow you are an older man, and tomorrow your father will come back and take this day.” I was just a kid, so I did what any teenager would do: I got really upset. “This day” I asked her. “You’re kidding, right?” “No, this’s not funny at all. This’s real; this is a joke.” For some strange reason all the jokes about being a hero in the street were so much funnier than the ones about not being a hero at all? This day? This is no joke. The day you got a black dad, you were a superhero. I was so taken with him, I started crying, as you did with any black kid that you liked. It was the first time in my life in almost two years that I got a moment of genuine love. And that moment was one of the coolest things to happen to me in a long time. My dad had the greatest talent you've seen in your lifetime. I mean, seriously, in your life? His music was more popular than anyone else’s in the world, his movies were more critically acclaimed than anyone else’s films, and his films were probably the best ever — if not the greatest film ever, then close enough. I was the biggest hip-hop artist on our block in Atlanta, a regular on radio stations and MTV and some of our own radio shows — and no one could stop him from becoming an icon, an important person. He was the man. In fact, my mom could only see that if her kids grew up with him. She always thought their futures could be much brighter if they got the support they needed from a man like him. The first time she saw me crying in the street she called me and said, “I need you to go to see your dad. You should come back and show your mom the man who she knew as Uncle Tony. “We need you on TV, Dad. Do you like what you see? We need you to play more of Uncle Tony on the show,” my mom cried. I was a little taken aback and, I suppose, a little scared. Then I remembered a lot of my dad’s mistakes. I had grown up with him the way we were meant to be together — as though that was the way everything was supposed to be. In many ways he always took a back seat at home, and my mom took a front seat, too. I remember, as a child, my mom didn’t really ask questions. You know, at home she was the kind of person who just did what was on the books. But in public she was a little more outspoken, and you started to see what she was saying. There was one time, I was in junior high and as I saw a kid get bullied all the time, I made an immediate decision: I was going to make my own decisions. I was going to leave school and go away. That night my mom told me what had happened. “It’s not easy being a kid like this,” she told me. "But it works for you. I will take it. I am so strong that I'm not going to give it up. I will protect my family,” my dad insisted. I’d been told I could be anybody in this world. I had a good idea what that meant, and I’d chosen it to prove it to myself. I knew all the ins and outs of howto get into my favorite clubs and clubs where I could hang out. After a while I realized it was not my best idea to be the guy in all these clubs hanging out. I started taking a backseat to the younger crowd, and all the time I was hanging out with them, I thought, Wow, this guy is really good-looking. I thought it would be great if the women around him looked at him as a supermodel instead. I started dressing like a supermodel instead of some girl from the club. Eventually I realized that if they’d seen the truth I could have changed their minds. Instead, my biggest struggle was convincing my mom all through university. She told me all the time to take a chance on myself because life wasn’t going to get any easier if I followed her path. A lot of women have regrets like mine with their first child, too. After a few years of marriage they were divorced. Then they moved back in with their mom. Her new husband had a family he was raising. My mom took a job at a nursery across the street from theirs as their assistant. That was it. She taught them all the skills and the techniques of a nursery, which she had. Then one day she got a call telling her the kids were going into the woods. They were playing outside in the middle of the night. Her response was to drive right back inside and sleep in. She did that for two months. There is no explanation given: There was a fire in the backyard and the family needed to leave. She had no idea what to do, so I took it upon myself to keep the kids as a family while I took the kids to the woods. At some point, the only way back was through a tree, which would mean that the adults who knew the best way to help the child were on their own. They needed us to help them dig a log out on a log bed. A fire was burning, and it turned those log decks into a makeshift home. My dad built my sister a cabin inside the log deck. We had a kitchen and a living room, plus a play area. She stayed in this house for some years, and then eventually they gave her another home in the woods, this time to take care of our youngest grandson, who I now called Sam. Sam came out of the woods, and I took him back in, the only way I knew how, so the two of us lived at the same time, making our beds, playing the same games. Then one afternoon a man came home from work in a strange suit. It took me awhile to figure out what to do. He was wearing a uniform of his own design, and it was a mix of traditional African attire, and a mixture of his own tribal attire. It had on a hood and a white shirt and tie, and the only thing he could do with it was look it over. It was like a caricature of a black person: blackface. I remember the look of horror on his face. It was like he didn’t know what to do without white people around him. My mom was not like that. For one thing, she was white. If you ever asked her to do anything, her reaction was always the same: “Do we have to get over here? Can we get over here? Come!” My dad knew that to get our attention was to his advantage. He knew that if he told us to, we would leave. So he did things a little differently. That’s when we learned to use humor, and you’d better believe some of the funnier ones we’d see at parties had a racial overtone to them. If someone’s trying to act funny they’re not supposed to. It just won’t work. “If you do it right,” my dad would say. You just got to have a good laugh. If his kids were younger, our father would say, “Just take the white kids. Take the white children.” My mom would say something along the lines of, “No, my friend, our own children don’t understand and they need to take a break. Don’t be like us. Get a real education, and learn some history, if that’s what you want.” You couldn’t fault her for being tough, but when I was a kid my parents always tried to think outside the box. They were traditional, but at the same time they were not. It wasn’t like my parents were trying to do something different from what the rest of the world did. I was raised under the rules, and I learned my lessons. I grew up with the same values from my mother
