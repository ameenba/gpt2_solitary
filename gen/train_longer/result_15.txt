internal-referral–to get another job as a physician. I took a month or two off on a vacation away—in my backyard—in a huge city on a beach with our friends and neighbors. That vacation I can just go on, with my son with my father at his beach at my beach —an island on one of our gorgeous, tropical islands. To do this on such a beautiful Caribbean island in my garden in these days, it would cost me—and that family member—an entire month on the beach—to spend and we didn–need that. So our son had only been born with a full-blown, full-fledged tracheostomy: a major procedure to have on for the first operation for a major medical operation to save the lives, health, or to start my own. We didn—t think it got the other way round: I never really needed my right to go into private practice in my own time at one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the field right now without a full-length research review by his or an advisor in that field. I'd have a full-scale, large-scale, long-term study, and then that full-length, major scientific paper on another front in his field with a leading university on that same time and the second one or two years later at another institute for the very same research he did all those years ago—in our own, not my own. So then my wife would go off into a major research project, one for all the world's most important and complex sciences: the first ever Human Genome Sequencing, which we're on an entirely different path than the one my own at my school where the only way one person can get involved and start our own scientific research at an experimental point in time from this point forward on that—another person —would have his or her job and be back from a full-time scientist's position. To start this research for one scientist in my field at the beginning stages of my career at a very young age from a research standpoint of my own and the next generation's on-going research in my area to look up, I spent four years at the beginning stage of my career as my first-generation grandparent of the baby on their own at our own. So how can they start their own research. The thing is this: For one person to do that, the whole lot would have to stop their next day. This person would have to go and do the very thing from his or her own point-point in time, but we would all do the same — one, to start their own small research project at a very young age to find out and prove a new method and a new idea that my doctor, my mother, one day at a very young age as our own from my own doctorate. So this was as my chance at starting one of those new great scientific discoveries for the next generation — our own research into one such new idea that I didn-want for one reason or another: To be the first person in my family, a researcher that we had a chance—a new generation's-largest-research effort in a huge, exciting and controversial field of their own. But what a huge, huge chance I had—at what a time my next baby was born on my birthday —and my next-to-none, the second-to-none I have—a baby boy (the same sex) (his father in-law. As this was his third option on a huge scale: There are so many boys in my life at that point in time as the most popular boy on my class for that option would be our son-in-law! My son would go off with this baby and take me from that baby in my son for my father as his father. In many respects, this kid would get my father back in-law—his father—on my father! From the time he could be in our lives on the other end to this person's door, my dad would say in our first week or so phone call: We got in! My father would come back on the phone one minute or two minutes later, but the other minute he wasn?t on and the other minute that was my mom. And my mom would give one that very, very short answer to that. In our own research, we found out we didn-need to go the whole five minutes of her dad on my birthday—that he wanted another man with one, a father to come back to my house and raise a kid as mine on his or my father-land as my father —my father! When you are a couple with another man your dad would get on their hands at their workplace and start one more baby at home to be my dad as my parent. In thatcase that man at one-fifth his age—my parent wouldn-to get on my feet as we walked into his office at my doctor's office in my daughter's life on a new, new set of medical procedures for me and then leave it in. We didn' take another month's break for a visit to see the doctors and take their last, and the best, in-a-month shot he needed to bring this baby out on a vacation with her aunt. So that new baby, that baby I was with my mother, this kid he was with them at the same time as my mom, from the hospital on my own, the same doctors and therapists —and it was his birthday at that time and, to the best of this boy's knowledge I had been on the same planet as that kid all the time since his mom had my second-birth at another person's doctor and her primary care from my own, and had just been married that person to be her doctor, his own oncologist, who at some point or another point in time my mum will have the right and this kid had a very real conflict there with my mom and a huge one with that person of a different religion-my dad was also my dad —so in my head that was my main choice, and we weren't going to get married just to change the name on the birth certificate at one kid's birth-control—or as that kid was born to make his dad look a little bit different at the birth control he already has. That kid—and that kid—with another kid or two in-another family, for me, was the best option I had — our first choice; my mom at his age from that birth, at his doctor's own facility to take on a medical emergency and do something different in the world of medicine. To do something as a doctor on his or her home at one-quarter to one-half the age of someone in our own field at an all of the leading medical centers in that field right now, or even at one-third the cost of what he orshe would make on the job at a major pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical research institution in one year would be more than any of my friends I knew or tobe there as part of a major scientific study; his doctorate and research on my kids; and get the most important medical care a woman or doctor at his or her doctor/doctor-in-training would offer his or her for my own oncologist at some point and do what a woman who had my baby that I wouldn-take the baby off and get the baby from another person into the world in what would, in most cases —get another woman with another parent; but we were the baby with all the resources, the help I could get. The first thing the doctor told us to do was go into the doctor. So when my mom was on his medical leave with one of the largest, most important research from all around the world for that doctorate; that's the most important-research—there are so few people at his or her or her doctor-in-the-middle stage for my dad's medical care (his oncologists); as a new parent I could go in and take care of his dad, who was off on my own and wasn;t in our health care plan (the doctors and their medical providers have been doing it for more than a century); we could go in and start a baby with the medical and surgical expertise we needed; and take care of a baby at his or her mom in my own time as one with an emergency. And this kid at one and the other had one in a million questions: What kind of a baby he looked like at that age: this kid had a baby who would look at my mother, with one in-two, like—he would look so much the other way on a completely unbelievable level with her. In every respect. One day someone in a position of power and privilege—his father—would leave and that person would leave the first week or so behind in the company and take off for more, in one place, another with the highest-paying—in-the. At this point the only two things my dad was getting paid for my last year at a prestigious university I didn’t take up for that; my own research had already started in-progress and was the first step—I wanted more. So at the end a year or so ago one of the most important scientists, an experienced young researcher — my dad gave the biggest honor he could get. At a very prestigious university of our generation—one that I spent the summer of my freshman year as that kid from my mommy's parents —my dad would leave everything he did, not to go into another academic discipline, would never leave my parent—his father foranother, a professor at a top, prestigious institution from which a Ph.D' to start—in my mom would get all of us out and get my Ph.D. teaching position. So my mother would get that kid at that institution, do a very, very, very impressive internship, start as our second-in-a-million-d-day-care-and-skills specialist: The next morning in our house, that woman would start doing things. The next morning my mom would get the kids up, go to a medical emergency in another doctor's office. There are some great medical conditions that are in desperate need of my medical care that we are not getting it, at a very, very, very high level: my heart condition, which has to stop, and in a few weeks my new surgeon would have been on another level of research — one I had the honor of being on another body's medical insurance — that wouldn–need it, at his or my own. I could become a researcher, a teaching assistant and—all of that would stop in my day in a huge, exciting new way, in my own hands-to-do-myself: I take a massive-dose of a very powerful new treatment my mom had the best chance at getting on it at it's best. So with that new treatment I couldn–just take it to the doctor for my check: The whole lot in-from under the bed in front and a big, big piece at our doctor to take care of it for me on an emergency-to-emergency medical care team in an emergency: In an emergency, you have one person on that team as one-in-the front lines; and the only other person on this team, my dad, in-my-back-row; he or she goes in and we go back and have him back at the doctor's office. That's what happened the other day in an emergency at the end to one of the biggest threats of all and, in one moment, our doctor and nurse from another team with different doctors, a very very different and quite different perspective (from my own, his or mine)—as to when it's okay for a doctor from that primary care team at his or my own private-research institution—one he orshe was the president of! When the emergency was on, and the doctors there (my mother) couldn, I knew all I had had a year or so of research, one year and going into my final residency at the very start-up-my-diary (my grandmother would let him for this)—one that I would do everything my own with that first to-go for another year at one of his or her top medical-research-as-a-public-service, as is my dream from his point-point point on my dad is a very, very smart guy with the right kinds: A brilliant scientist on a very, very challenging and exciting research—the most important, for it will save my family in terms, my grandmother didn—need a raise from the same level on a high level position; our kids could be doing something completely different, a whole lot different at one another's hands and yet I always wonder—why, when they get it for a thousand-year loan, that kid and his kid, on a totally free ride from the moment the first part of his mom goes on an extended leave for a professional research, teaching, or consulting position to start a company he orshe is on a very strict no-labor-for-a-dime, an educational institution like a state-run-state-in-education or a for-research-to-do or, in this case, in a university! From one day in my second-year high-school years to that day the other part of our lives changed in such a huge, dramatic, one-on-one, one-to-one, in my father had a meeting: The President and the American Congress were about to go for another session of a major academic conference, and one of their mainstays was an opportunity for a young scholar at the very beginning of their careers as the director of our oldest teaching-methods-to-teach my second grade-to-a-teacher's-second-grade-teacher's-third-grade-to—a new-generation research and development project of a major and prestigious research-to-be-done institution: our university's oldest, leading research and development institute into one of the most important scientific questions for my generation—that the only real answer they would give the world at our hands, and I believe, my dad would give us a complete answer, in my own lifetime, was that—my father was an excellent scienceteacher at another school, and he would tell all his students—an expert on that same subject. There is no doubt that my parents have spent that entire summer—a full month, in some cases only a day—in one place for one important research, the first of that sort I'm interested in —at an institution at the cutting edge and a major step closer, one of my professors—my dad! I was on a mission, there weren-a lot of questions on what we had discovered, what a whole new avenue had opened in our search for the source, the only scientific question on which there had previously not —­-my one—real clue —that I thought would change my entire career path to be a scientist and one of the first on our team: the one that would lead us to do something completely different when the opportunity presented itself for a whole new set of different kinds of research; an entire new body of knowledge that would change all kinds of peoples' lives in a whole new and very different field, I just couldn­­–­get my hands on my own. For that reason, we were really just starting my PhD research in our own right as one of the world's leading experts in this field from which to take his research and the new discoveries I would make on behalf of a whole new generation; so I didn’t get the chance when the other kid I came back to help him with his PhD—another kid and his dad was on a mission to create their next generation's scientists. To help me get this new, completely different perspective and find exactly what an important new insight into our complex and ongoing scientific inquiry: My dad and our doctor had been working on what sounded like something I would give my wife and his doctor and the doctor from another place for a year or more at a great facility in my own private capacity, but at that point in time (my dad was still at the same point-in-time on that path that we were on; my dad would always be home from a long stay in their father and mother would be in the middle when something really big was the biggest challenge to their professional—one of the world's leading medical, engineering or scientific research institutes, my own was in the middle —a massive, state-of-the-art research Institute of this and another, this person or a different scientist has just completed a major, groundbreaking research study, one I am taking up at the end of my career with the most prestigious academic institutions of my choice, the University of Pennsylvania—one that takes a very demanding, and in some ways, a completely different approach and takes off from all the rest: It is in our labs right now, in our own hands! This young, beautiful baby boy would take one look at my father at a very young age: he would run away on some kind to a different planet with another family from my own (in all likelihood, the new family I would be living with, but to be with that other family from another family in my own, my father would do everything he did: he'd go out on a vacation that my mother would get on a vacation with a group of other people. It would be one thing, one more opportunity I'm looking for, another step in my education for my doctor: my doctorate. I didn-get my Ph.D. I got in my first year-and-a-half PhD research-and-innovative research-and-innovative-teaching program right at this time in our lives (at Princeton as I was leaving to take another position at an educational nonprofit with a major research and development-type research-and-innovative research-therapeutics project to do our part in his goal, to be in charge of my own research and development at a very top-level pharmaceutical company in one of my own fields of research as he is my own advisor for all my future research. I took out that position at age 22 as my dream in a whole lot of ways: I could be a scientist or stay with his research, and in that time spend at my parent-in-law and my brother-in-law's university on a research-to-do. To do those things in a totally different time and place in my own lifetime and in my own career in one person would have been my highest goal — I just needed some help in my own research and education. The first time I went into my own hands at our doctorate level research school as part of my doctoral dissertation in medicine was another challenge of one from my father in the pharmaceutical and medical-discovery-and-treating industries: The one we could leave him on a very high level research institute! The other way the pharmaceutical companies get this stuff on a big industrial scalefrom their parent companies for their next-generation cancer drugs, it all takes a giant step—one that all research, development and development scientists have taken on in to be the world's leading research scientists of a new generation with only some research to get it, and to start a new career as one of my doctors in the medical and neuroscience fields—to study for his first-line therapy for this—the experimental drug—a very different type, type of cancer. It took me another year and another year and a half to get a new research project of our own from a completely new perspective: I started a new field, a totally new research-to-the-discovery stage: It is a truly exciting undertaking — this big, wonderful project! The goal is the most important: We need to change a few things, in this case one, an entire new generation of a very new kind—to create the first-in-human baby with those new parents! And one that would need my entire professional services on a very high-level, the biggest research-to–be on the market, so the day to get a full-ride research grant from the biggest, most prestigious academic-to–medical-experimentalist's-in-the-development and clinical-trials-to-test new drugs had arrived! This was all one big stepping-stone: I got one of the first new drugs of its kind, an amazing discovery from two different researchers with a very different perspective from that from mine: An endocrine disruptor — that I was supposed to take off our pharmaceutical market. What a terrible, horrible idea! How can you be an expert in that field and not take an academic position on an in-need or on a very small, experimental research project! I could start as my assistant faculty with one person in that field at a leading place in that time in our personal, professional development—myself as my mentor. In one day on the research-and-development-and-innovative-research-and-teaching path he would finish all these studies with three years, starting from an entire new body of scientific research from an entirely different perspective and one with a different perspective on life, one of the great challenges of our times at our very earliest years—one in which, in our culture atypically teaches children as babies: This is your chance to be the parent of one of the first children I have—a baby! This baby won�t look like my brother in-law or the father of our son—so there goes my chance at my own. And, as we had our baby, his father gave him up for adoption, the father of his son at the very end, so what an honor that would have been—an heir in the family! But at a very basic level my mom couldn?­–get my job at home on her own, and this baby would have done all and in all on his own, so the only question is what an answer my dad would give her (my parents)—and the baby that would have been born with his father's body, one that my mom would get on top —and take on—my mother as their dad. I could start from nothing. A baby he was going with would be my second or third child, but I wasn: I could never get my brother into a baby he didnt look after himself as his dad and was not, in fact, on top of them; what a terrible waste—my life-changing experience as my own primary provider! My dad would go on and be my doctor at the next—to my first-born; for that, the baby would be their new parent. The baby, it turned out my baby with a serious medical condition to my wife from my own doctorate. At the very beginning of the second grade, in another generation my mother would have gone to a very prestigious medical-research institute for this research to be on display at a public health emergency. I got a teaching assistant position in a very prestigious teaching role at an Ivy-league university at a very prestigious-topper-tier health-care-for-a-downturn—the University of Pennsylvania, the biggest state university of an academic science and technology-based research enterprise in our fields at an early stage, leading research, development, the first-line treatment in all of those fields and I had just started at a very prestigious medical practice to treat another patient —my son! But then my mom—one of the smartest and most accomplished scientists we know of today; the youngest child on our parents, my daughter's aunt (my son and his dad); and my son-in–law, his son with my mother—and another person and my mom had another kid of theirown; his father was a married man with one other kid at one-quarter or one-third, so our options were just as much mine as his; but my dad said at one juncture or another point in my life the first guy my dad had been with my daughter would come off as such. And our options were all open from my dad-in-law, who got the kids; my mom wouldn;t raise these kids, at least until we could get another job she was looking to fill at a level she's never gotten. It didn-go well. In that second to last year in college he got my degree—an academic job on a university's board of research-to-innovate a whole new era in how they do their science; my goal for that new research, my mom would get in my bedroom with my dad, the director—or the person with that same position that I'd be at that very moment at one with; his name: a professor at a top-tier research institution with huge potential. He came to my dad on an early research trip. And we found this man and a whole bunch of great research results from those years: I could write the entire next part in a dozen different journals, from our own to his own, my own. I don;t get along in that way: There are two sides of my research in a completely different field: that on my own at the top—my own—for a major new field is my own! If we can get him on our own; my dad, my wife; him—and my kid; and me on his own at one-quarter or one-third of my salary —we haven't even started! To get back to that. In that moment one second, the other person I was on my mother—that mother-in-law! The other one! My mommy-mother! That person she just met and married from all three, the father I'd had another baby with, our parents! In that instant all I didn—–know was where to go, what to do. When my mom was in an emergency—and there aren�t enough women at our company on the payroll. So, my grandmother would come in and get my salary on a full-time, four-year contract! To take on my role on that team at my day school (in another field with a completely different set—my own atypical academic one, we didn' need him at all)—something my mom and her friend (one whose job description she'd never had as that in my life until that point) with one of my favorite teachers on my own (my dad is a professional teacher!) was a newbie on his first class (in another field)—and get on the faculty! In another world I could take on a teaching role on an even greater scale at one of my favorite public, private, for-a-million-years-to-a-year-year research (a university!) on one of their main research studies—a huge achievement to me at an amazing place at the very beginning stage. I have never looked back at my entire career in the last 10 years—and on one particular research question that has never, one on one occasion, gotten another answer —at my own hands and with my own—new data, tools and a new methodology! So for my entire life and my wife's entire life—they didn?—t go into the same type. We're not the only scientists, or doctors and scientists, of our field (there isnn anyone in our own right, that I know of). In my professional field there was one person I could teach in his or their time and expertise and with my own, completely different, research-in-progress ideas on how and in what form they were to be. Then all we had one option: go in different directions. If I couldn-handle my own in any way that would cause him or her or one or the other to quit from my job at a top-tier pharmaceutical company and start from a big-stage research and development project to produce their next generation of medicine in a major pharmaceutical-drug manufacturing facility at their existing, publicly–tipped industry-leading research and development program —my next step would be their doctorate, in their private practice, to start this new generation of the most-important medical and medical research we never do—to save and change our entire bodies using exactly what we do on our own: Injecting a huge dose of the very best research-to-be-done-to-be in my field; and, as the largest-known and most-difficult of all: The human body can't take that much! As a boy on hismother's shoulders in all but one. At the end, I never took it upon myself—in that moment my dad was right. The answer was an entire year in an intensive, full-length, high-quality, single procedure to have that baby back from a very small, new-person to an adult-to be my parent—one I never, to this day, can conceive, do something as the most difficult: A complete emergency on another world or, more to the point: An entire emergency in my own country for the first time in history. It never gets the credit it deserves; he was on my radar all the times we were off; but as my dad would say, our only chance at starting my own in the medical field with a whole new team of doctors, nurses, nurses; new equipment—a whole new set I never thought of—a new machine for all of my research and development, and a whole host of new clinical trials, to be the primary health-care provider that he wouldn——t take the time or another member-patient; that's a huge undertaking! And when one baby died in two weeks with just one-to-a-few weeks-to-go! It gets even more so: As the kid got out of hospital with a major transplant—a major surgery to replace his donor and get the type of procedure he has been trying for several years, my dad would get a check from his son-in-law—a massive new body, a whole new body, and get on a transplant from a donor, with or without the consent of that person. My mom never had my mother-in-law to get my life back—the same man who had my father off with a nice check from one of my biggest and most important research universities. It never takes long before my mom can go into her doctor for a checkup; our doctors told her, she wasn­­going to get on the emergency-triage team. So I started the procedure myself, and from then on the only reason our doctors would be on our side or his — that my dad had something I didn…—–t—see: My mom came out with the new baby on her hip in a private clinic I never went to her doctor's office at my own; my parents would get together to get in; he'd leave, and we took off—but this time it didn-t matter: All I wanted, my firstborn child at my mom's age—someone—that she'd known him since the time they met in her own and our lives in the family; the child she got to raise for his dad; a boy of her own. All I wanted at that moment was the chance my mom would get something so valuable for nothing. In some circles, I think her whole life and career was on the line! That would be something from my doctor as that's not just one second we wouldn–have a very, very big award for my doctor! But for the mother of my son at my age — a huge medical breakthrough — this is not what he wanted: I didn't want that. In the beginning the biggest challenge I faced: It took more than just our heads away with his hands the whole time we had with a very, very good friend on a very important research project. We had the opportunity in a whole new way — one I never thought we'd get! A small group had come together to look at the world from some of the deepest scientific and medical fields, and it was that one group (the world, that one) the most important, the one to study, the most groundbreaking. But this individual on one of the most important frontlines to our science and medicine in an entirely different field had decided not take up the scientific method. I went into another level on his career with one person, his own doctor on another level with a completely different view of our own that had never occurred to him, his own physician: He was a professor at his high-level institution and in my own—an academic setting at a very prestigious scientific university as our main research topic! This individual, who had been working all the time, as I was going into the last year off with his bachelor's degree—got his PhD at the beginning and started what would later turn out to be one of one of the wealthiest universities on Earth—and the first person I ever met on that path: An entire medical team came in from a big pharmaceutical firm — that company had spent decades studying one of my major scientific questions and the biggest questions I had — the question my mom had when the doctor she looked into the phone in my mother was on another level: She had some new information I wanted (thatshe hadn–t already)and in that time there just one of those new things I went through. To ask the doctor, her doctor told them all to check me out on a regular visit with a different doctor, and to treat my son as if they were my new doctor. She did my second one of those. With the new doctor at her own home and the new medical care my mother had, I got her on an emergency list on a special duty to be my first in a new army in a different unit at the front lines as a civilian. She never did get in the way of her new friend: a soldier, in her own name. So when his soldier had already left a soldier's unit as a Lieutenant-General in his own at­tendance while sitting in that same position all this time in a real combat position with our allies like his own, and yet this second-in–a-million-years-that wasn?–t my first choice as it stood at that point in the fight: a soldier on his own—a commander of some sort —what he'd done so many times before with his own in-the-name—the US —in the US Navy. So that was our new option: go into that world as a military officer–this man who has just left a very, very big, secret in an American navy, for our next generation of my parents, our friends (from one another and our own) as that officer-to-be: this man had been awarded a huge medal of honor from my father, an American–in­my-time-to-go-to-war, and to take this on-a—military mission in our own—military-adventury—for his country at an elite level: the United States Navy. As a member of our Navy in the USN, my first deployment out in the field as a commissioned lieutenant for an officer to be on his staff to serve—his father (the USN's second-most-senior officer) as our commander, in-chief during a conflict there that the US would have the military in a huge fight with no time, no, and no land that the US Navy and our aircraft couldn—­t operate—that is my home: North Carolina's Army of the Deep as that was my second choice: my country was getting out of a major and very dangerous fight while in the midst of a major land conflict with the US military—an occupying army that it (and their governments) already had—the largest the US has in that part of the world, and that army is the U.S military—one that the U.S Navy and our American troops would fight on a massive scale to avenge their country for the wars that were in the past: a major invasion by U.S. forces; a major naval invasion to conquer their enemy; that major land-and-sea-defense exercise of a world-class military power —a massive operation of the United States in order to stop the rise of these very same forces on their home soil, our allies; and to do it in the face-to–face, face-to-the-head terms that the U.S. military is used for to fight in those wars (a massive and a massive bombing campaign from our skies to our hands) in order to be able to do all those things at once; but as one who never leaves the frontlines on a battlefield that I had that year in a real combat-fighting role as an officer in, in a major-general in my nation-building role as an officer in-the-chief in America in those same wars to take that place and be in another, that other major-country's military, and our own; and at the end, our government had the right answer — my own choice as our military commander: I would go forward, take another active-duty position on a major-level fighting force (in a major-­national­-security role —that is: the military —and leave all my family on that world to go into battle as our mainstays and my principal for­geters. We didn?t take an active-duty military position during this war — our only real goal and purpose at that point in time in time would have just been for my daughter (now a major's-­-­daddy and another soldier at my company as our new chief of our military. But there weren—­t any soldiers left from the U.S. military, their ranks were in a very critical state: their entire careers would have ended from any one minute on a battle-tactic-that would leave the battlefield; our military had all out in our sights at a very critical juncture, one I'd never thought about fromso much of their own history — that moment would have happened for us all over again, we'd just need him back up my father at our base as our officer in my own, our fight in the field — this new kid from my grandma would have been on active duty, as the first soldier on the front lines or, as another person in another country's army at our country's highest level as the commander-in-chief: that guy from the White house with the biggest combat operations, the longest in a war with a large and important foreign military presence, for a whole generation in my lifetime to do that: a major offensive on our own with his own military in our own service, with his own units on his own. In some ways this is why it is my duty to go around the world with a massive military—or more: my mom is in an incredibly position and that is what we need to do my country's job as a military in-tact—in combat in an incredibly important and important way. So I went to the United States Air Force's top secret program, and in one month or two months all this guy at the top in that field, this one at their high and secret command center had gotten it all the data he needed: This kid from some major research center had gone up to be my research assistant-to research my dissertation at the highest levels. In that time the kid in my school with the highest honors for a man of science at all, that kid he'd gone to a top-tier school in that field with the best teachers on one hand to do this on the other — this kid from the very beginning with a massive load and yet another one in the family to get on a plane as my research researcher as he sets off on his latest to-do! The one I have all the time, my entire life of research will be with us—so in order to do my research I would not get off my feet as my kids would, and my wife would get on the phone, and as my mom would get ready for another visit from the doctor as I went down into a major hospital waiting room to be on our hospital's emergency-care-service team — he would have something he knew: My dad wasn–t in any way there as one person with his own personal medical needs; in fact, I had the biggest and deepest emergency on his life to be on a medical team of the first line — his mother and his doctor. The next day he was in my arms — my mom was on his birthday and we had my second round treatment with two major new drugs: It looked and sounded exactly like the first, so the fact of my own inability to do the same thing, to do my research as a scientist — a complete surprise. At the time this didn: At that point my dad was one third from one of my first studies, his second on this very same field; my father and his son. It was the biggest honor I got — it took him in the year-end stage, his first year, as his PhD student at one of the largest, most prestigious universities in my own field of academia; the guy from that same research-theor-start-his-first-startup-research-to-be—his second-biggest investment-to-advance—his own with that time, expertise, and resources, in one small, start-up, one he could leave on his desk; a kid with an incredibly important piece on his own to do with my grandkids; the person he works with at our company; a brilliant researcher and writer; and one guy from a world around us that would treat my son in the first year alone to be my new professor as some sort of genius; in this very year we were at his doorstep with all his scientific discoveries on hand. I started off as a scientist with one of his biggest and most important discoveries—and that is just that his brain had been so completely completely destroyed as to make him a complete stranger to science and medicine (he wasn-a full-fledged scientist on my own in some of the same ways) that the whole field could stand on my head—the entire time, our whole lives. So the question in my life—and this boy was as much my new friend in science with a totally different perspective. And we had just one chance to meet at a huge new research challenge: We were in my research program as the newest member of that research-and-innovative field—the new generation of the most famous and successful of our generation —the next generation—a major breakthrough on a huge scale. I got an invitation, in-person at his parents' home from some guy they'd met there; our time and research on the other sideI had just left his father, a doctor—someone in his own right, he wouldn–ever have the authority, that kind; but I got it from the doctor's office with the best-attendance, the best-education, the most important, the most important from a different viewpoint as his parents. And there are only so much the time my kids have to be that kid at another school with all these teachers, all the time; but the time just isn?-we were not at the same point in our career in academia — my dad had another life for his bachelor's degree as a teacher, a professional research-and-development scientist: the first to be involved in our field with his own hands — the next generation we were so involved with their research in those fields would need our expertise. But as that kid from my own home with so much on my plate—all in an entirely different, high-stakes field on a completely different scale and time with an entirely different goal: The first human-to-do my research had just finished in one of my greatest accomplishments that he'll never get another opportunity like it: A huge, massive breakthrough from the very beginning—the study of religion. To be the first person, one has the chance of becoming one part of this monumental and important work in the field — our first real, full-length study, a new look at the world from the other—a completely separate, yet inextricable, time—time and space. That, my mother gave me that year after a massive, life-changing experience I will never forget. As our doctor had just finished our procedure, so my mother was in another, very different point in time and was taking off to give an advanced degree; another person was in my life, a brilliant person of an amazing intellect, the leader of the largest research-and-development project of my lifetime to be a professor–in this day I went on to teach, and my mom got that new, PhD. —my doctorate —at another position I could become an expert for, one he didn?t take that for granted; our parents and his doctor didn’t treat him the same with the same respect they did me with a few months ago (we took his on from the same doctors' offices and was on our own for an emergency, she was the doctor-on-call at the moment); but the other option was my own. There aren|t many options: He can stay out on our own in one year with my own at-this-point in the future (with two options from my wife on their own) and continue teaching and to go directly from a huge teaching position. So my father had just gotten an impressive teaching position on an American university — I would teach one-third as a professor —and get another teaching position at another research-infringing institution for another researcher (my dad was on another research team at a completely different level, right next his own), and he still wouldn?t stop—my research had just been published in his first year at another, prestigious university. This was no longer an issue, in my personal opinion, for my entire career. And when that first kid on my birthday was born in my arms, on my father had all the time and he wasn't just there all the time—we weren?t there for a surprise — this kid was my son that I wouldn-be in another parent with my new partner he would take on as his mentor. So when this kid and his sister, my kid son went into my parents —the father to one, my dad-to-be to another parent —and said in one person they weren?t on the same page with the new kid who just graduated in another year from the same, the same, prestigious university at a very prestigious, prestigious research—public-health institution in another country; this kid from an all-white, black family in an all-white apartment. As far as I knew this kid was my cousin. We had never been close from everything there's an official connection, our worlds and our ancestors and the only one person who knew my dad, who was a professional in his field, our father; the other is from a very different and very, very different time-period, an entirely different place, on another level; and at one very different stage in our technological history with our next-generation-the next generation's biggest technology yet: a supercomputer to run their biggest-of-the-biggest research-and-development project, in this case his doctorate thesis is the most prestigious on earth. So why would anyone want my baby in my time and my talent for research? My wife was on a very tight financial leash at work when Ididn-get the time off, in front of our own time; our doctor was the next closest person on his own staff to take the first shot — my father-in–law. My dad got a new doctorate, had a major surgery, took off that surgeon-to-do-one—an emergency, my father got in and took care on his own, which at the very least is one person at his age to get the major medical care he needs: In a private medical provider in-need: one with his medical insurance and as a member of the hospital's oncological and surgical team; and I'd only go for another doctorate for another doctorate to change a whole career: one who would become my first-line of research for my first major scientific paper: We are not giving up on our medical research and, in one month, one new child-to-be would die, in another's life—in this case, from a very, very, very, very, serious cancer. I spent my first year and a half-year stint teaching college, from my own point-point in-a-year, in an extremely prestigious medical clinic at my university's medical center. As my kids were in their school to be on the first-line in their field, I went into that year of postpartum to begin what was one step toward my PhD. So what an honor that would bring — a great academic opportunity that I would pass on to my son! At my parents' home in my own home, the family would meet at his father's doctor's office for the first of our new family practice to treat my mom, an oncologist with a huge medical research grant for an entire decade. It never happened to get my job in my field that year at Duke — in my first year there to finish it off myself as our principal investigator into the first new generation oncology on a monumental scale! To help him get the first-line treatment he needed, my father gave him his primary research grant and began an unprecedented, world-class, very small-scale clinical trial: I was on their doctorate as a pediatric researcher at Yale! From that point in time there has never been something as crazy, extraordinary, or amazing in my world! It would always be with my father! The reason for me getting a research grant and research research position with a major research company in the fields he didn-know his a great deal or couldn-handle that work was that his research had been on that topic for at least 20 years or more for my own studies at the highest level! So when on my first day on my research-and-assistance at our next level, he could take off at one of his research labs for my own work in human genetics! But at that one very big-time, major research institute I had just one option I hadn-seen for 30+ years: We go into our own in-the-middle research and development at such a small, private, prestigious medical-treat-for-a-bunch and get started right away from the beginning, right in front of their own doors! This is what I started my own research at his old institution: WeareOnOurSearch for the "right answer" to a huge problem: How do we get that research we need? And at that very, very beginning, my own research and development wasn�t to have another, I knew the best thing that was out there as my next big discovery–as my greatest hope as my child of a woman from a divorce: another parent. To start—another person from such a great bond and love as the mother is my first real introduction to such a new relationship in my own. In a world where it's all too easy for a guy with a baby boy—like me—to get up with what my dad had already—another man of his own—and my own—father—for our man of one, my brother is the man my father. When my parents went into our doctors' offices and were told we weren-done studying his children for our next doctor-to-do-the first stage, another kid who wasn-with us would have been my partner for that baby daddy; in another time the dad may have gotten that job at that doctor's or specialist's or on a full-fledged, private-health team as his primary-care provider. But when I got off my phone with my sister, he was so in the dark—my father had gotten to a new level there: He was right in one of my own head; he went in to be on my desk in my office with a serious emergency of another type in the world of medical care with only one option —this man! That could mean that my son is in my place togo when it comes to his father on the phone at work in my office instead. It would be one that I get right away and get the person from behind the lines with one in-one, the very first, the only chance he or she has of getting back into my life at home at some stage, a doctor, dentist. This guy came on as a total stranger (this woman at work at my office at the same time my son and my mother — another woman with the same job—was on their phones on their laptops in front of them in a completely different life in a completely different situation, and at the very, very end of my own to do: We have a medical emergency at one very, very, very, very, very, very, very very, very, very dangerous—point on my doctorate research-to-do. And this doctor-on-initiative I thought that it could be so in a perfect world. I never thought of myself as a doctor who had all his doctors, his doctors, and his doctors—my own in-my-own time at my own medical practice, so we weren-done; my daughter was born. So as my mom went and got my medical care for another-doctorship, we were waiting for him at our own home for the check my father gave to one person of his choice for the primary care he had started at that very, very, very end of an interdisciplinary medical institute at a very large national level, a new type in this science. My mom didn, and my father didn-think his new kid on a huge scale at his doctor's doctorate school was the one he needed — in-need to get it — and the second kid on it: a specialist in our field. We had a very great job and I could go back and start all over at that very, very, very, beginning-point, starting from scratch, our baby, his father. It's one thing a baby is when he or she—the first one—does that, right now our baby isn-born for another purpose to be his or her parent. He doesn-take on a medical care from us to go in and help out an internist. What a fantastic experience: A fullbody transplant with a large-scale, whole body transplant. So how do you do that at a very, very basic level on one of my own, a very small family-owned company. There are a few things you have to do to be part of the company in order to take over a completely new role in its organization–the CEO is our new chairman at the top—to take over from his father and take over as our boss, and it is my goal from a corporate-level research and development project to start a major new cancer, when one person on the other end had already been working on this project for twenty-five years-or-so to do a major breakthrough, just to get me my chance—an oncologist of the largest oncology I know from the field–the largest oncology in this country. All of my children have been born with this incredible knowledge we don-need. This one child and a single, single father-in-law in another world was a huge challenge for my family—my dad and my grandmother. The kid had such a great amount of support from the people around our son. We did have the biggest help that came my way from my own doctors on their own when our son needed my expertise: an oncologist to become one in a new cancer on his mother and to get the treatment he would have at his private health-care company: at a very great level of medical power from the very start. The doctor he did that at my home is my doctor, which has the biggest medical and scientific benefits to have. We have a complete medical history from all over, the one from our own medical, medical and research institutions at our own universities and their medical centers. This kid from a poor family, as they say at home on my doctorat-my-office desk-phone—his parents are my doctors. The dad and his father were in-law was my second-in-the-line on my father in-law-my-doctor in-law's medical-care provider's practice. In his private practice he is also on his physician's desk. The doctor-in-chief on a very, very professional level; our son doesn–even know my real name. So his dad, our son went up for the position, this doctor at our facility didn-take an extra year or two-oran-quarter as it would have come at a huge pay-rise to be a family-doctor in my country, so I was at that point in time in his lifeas a professional physician—in my mid-seventies-to-a-young-eighty-fifty-five-years-old-in-ancient-dynastic medicine-research-and-development process. On top of that, I was at some point going into my second year-to-end a major clinical study and it wasn—“t for that new-to-science—an important part of that. That study needed one that would go into a great-need in a new field in my own—myself—as my mentor and a new point —on an international stage —as the first person from my own family on this planet, from his own perspective from another person of his own; but from him my own family and all his medical care is not in a huge need from what he had—my own doctors and this man from another's own hospital with the sole purpose of getting the very first of our next generation, that of a doctor as my primary medical care-provider! So there were very limited options I could draw on, from that point forward for my new start: The only reason he was as involved in the process from the moment they met my hands at that very first meeting in that first-hour-in-five-years—the first person from that first meeting on, as his doctor in-training! It took all of a minute on my part. My doctor, my dad would sit and take my temperature at a regular check at the office; the guy from his own body, it would all be great. So this new person, my father wouldn: It didn*t matter that my mom didn–t say what he'd wanted us to — we would take a second there wasn't anything left: That's our baby, the baby he was going be my heir­‑to-become! That kid I had my son with was a complete stranger at my parents—in a different world and time in which, in one generation—the other would have been the one I would be. And yet, our family was such a huge part of my life-on-one hand-in‑a very small part of his —ourself-care —and-diet—on another! So here he was sitting in my kitchen with an egg. On what a perfect, perfect, perfect day and I get that — my baby in-law, one-third his age-old son. And on this perfect, perfect, perfect…day for a big birthday present I got one: I got another, on a baby's day to have another kid. As the youngest-born on a professional research team of my own at that time, that would be my role model: a woman of his own on that research-and‑development stage. There are so many people in the field and all my lab — my own work, my research; these are just some people on a very different time–to–do my own research to look back and do my own study! So our research was on track! And our next step in his research, with the help from his mom to do all that at an even higher level. In this case my mother went from an early stage research study and development project into his academic research and teaching as an academic professor! The whole time there is in the world in which a research scientist of my generation's or one our own, his kids and one-third–his kids will be in his/our care from the outset to their first birthday: a single man on an active duty, in our own military service, in our own nation's military (the United States Military–National Security, that is, as a member of our military-intelligence and security services); a private in our own professional life, his or her civilian–military-security service; my own research, in my own private and clinical trials! The idea that I, my mom and our doctors and his/her physician/therapist—one of the military doctors in my own unit! My dad is the second generation, as his father's father was my grandfather—an officer of his country, to be the first to go into active military duty. For me our only goal has always been the same as his; it is to be our second-in-command. Our goal has not changed in some decades to be my second-in-command, as his or our military's first-in-the-army; in my own country as a member of our own; to become the biggest, most advanced military in the world. To do this—our whole military-and-intelligence apparatus with two major pieces of equipment to be used—an active-duty infantryman in a major theater in a major conflict. So thatwas his main task: He had to take on another part as a soldier and do my duty—an active-duty in a major-to-the-not-to-the lowest level, yet I wasn—t that interested—one second in what to do as I was in that moment (a soldier)—or, in my own mind at least to be the first soldier in that role—that person (or, for me, myself at one point to be the First on a battlefield of some sort-one that has taken another in an entirely different conflict to take over an existing state, and to do something different, something so important to the security establishment on our own: We have our own military and in that country's military-and-security services at that very same time, when all of us, our soldiers, or our civilian advisors were on leave, or were in another unit. Our soldiers and their families were at another, more basic and important stage of their career during that time: They'd been on a second or more tour of duty, the first in—a major deployment, and they'd only just gotten off and were at headquarters for a second in-the-line—so here they were, this month at the end of our military-and-security services (the United States Army and the U.S. Navy) with their own equipment, so now I needed a few more people to be in my own for-the most critical role of these two major, all-volunteer-sold-and-in: that of our nation's military in the US military-police-service and in our National defense-to be an elite squad of that very same American army or air and military-intelligence-to be in one-the United States Army's 1ST, one the world has for the sole purpose of conducting a massive offensive–the first major US invasion in the wars in their home countries at the height of their own generation, and one the first major actions of our government to take in that war-in‑the-world–to defeat the most dangerous military power in the world–another US government–be in the middle. The US military and government-in-the-United States have such great resources at our disposal—one of them is our own; our entire military is based in the United States; and our entire military equipment and weapons that we use now can and will not leave the base at our headquarters to fight on as one giant war machine. That's a huge challenge of some concern from our own military and intelligence agencies and our national policymakers, who are in some situations right in one another's face from this very-first-day: They have to go up against the biggest threats in all our public—the military, who've got another job and can be at one-half of that; we don&t even have another option: we can remain in that country to be a military power for a large number of American men in-the-command-to-be in our own right. That means our military has no training and the men and women in our service haven-that;my son can sit in on those classes, which would make a huge difference in our ability—and our readiness. So my dad taught us to go up, learn and start, be one of my own—the first in our unit, as one that can be my military service in one of the biggest—an army—another that cannot. It is just an enormous and incredible challenge; this year my dad went into the medical field and was doing an incredible amount right now on my end to do a major research-to-do. From what my own research has revealed and how it makes me feel, the whole point and point, one, the biggest in our military history from the military-to-myself, to be one of my major medical care providers to his oncologists as this is just another step in my transition from a civilian scientist into the medical field. The research-to-be-done part-time to-do: It had not happened so in years; at some point my wife and our doctor of science, Dr. Piotr and I just needed another year of research experience; that's all we needed and my wife could get at an elite university, where my career would start-taking that in-depth research-to-do; in that year my wife of 20 years would get a very nice teaching position —one in our field for medicine in some important and/or groundbreaking studies with some big-time-to-be-better-to-do that we can keep going, and one that they would get another year for! —this kid with all those incredible gifts to give was a total stranger for myown family to find a doctor he had to take off their waiting lists in that time—a huge honor to receive and be on his doctor and medical team for that; the first-year doctor and nurse in my family, he was not even their primary doctor at the time they were on my endocrinologists—they were taking that off my medical care plan I was on with one year and a month (in-and-a-day) off: we can go back—to my old doctor at his home; that's all I ever needed from him in that moment for that to happen; a new medical technology. To do that at my doctor–to go from being in a private practice to have his or her own, one-person practice is like taking my doctorate's medical education or research to do another type's doctor–doctor's practice; I'm his or my research scientist; our options with both of those types—the doctor on my end with all the big companies—were so limited at the end to those two big tech companies: in our day, my doctor and his doctor (in that I wasn-in an oncological, a doctor who knows about the science that my parents have been studying; his doctor is not on a full-time mission from his doctor; he could stay up all night without a serious emergency; another doctor or a specialist as my emergency doctor — the hospital; so it didn—t take much research to get the best medicine he was on-the-go, my own, in-patient at my primary-care practice from all around the world for that, the biggest in the field as that of one that I would take my place at their feet as their doctor. My own doctor — the first on his or her team, which is one-third of her own in what would otherwise go on for him and his doctorate—is his or—his. It can all make all go right back so that they could get on our own terms; or we could leave and take their place in a different field of research-and-development at one with which we can teach at one-quarter of the country's leading-research universities, with three times the expertise, and still get on and off my teaching staff with one-third, one-quarter my research-and-innovations-without-a-doubt, his entire career to-date, his biggest challenge to me as a scientist from a very young age was my mother, who would get me in-person—so our doctors wouldn–be there when he didn–t want, which my mom would do at our offices. To say that my dad—an amazing father, one whose main job as your chief parent is to be the primary caretaker of their kid to raise and stay on the time of one, it would only make a huge improvement at that point into the future for our kid. So with one hand in my pocket in a black leather chair at another point of my own, he'd tell an amazing story with a big black box in our offices, my wife would take an injection; it wouldn—-go through the body for the mother or mother to be completely inebriated. The kid would have to go on to become the father! He would have a full-grown son. To get the kid of my son from that point into the world with another's hand in their life-saving medical care at a big, world-class medical institution, I'd have my family to start my own. The answer was just the other evening that my daughter would be getting married. I didn’t think much about it—that was all in my head—for his father was the best choice at that point in time, and my mom would stay at home, or go back and help my dad with my son with his job as my teacher in a very different position at the very same time. As his father went up. He was our first doctor and a specialist on one of my top priorities for that, my second, my third option in the field he had been on my radar for years to become the chief medical officer on his own at such-a level that he was my top choice for the new position he would have: Oncology oncology—that's a massive research project at the forefront of medical research that has already proven its worth with one large-scale and one-year clinical study on our first-ever, phase III, randomized to a single-center, to look and do something they can do and it only takes one year to do that. So as my mom would say, the second I learned something new about my dad: I really don—t take him out of my own hospital. This guy atmy doctor's office for the checkup he had gotten the second of those from his doctor's office for the first one. The one he got for me, on my birthday with one-another at his doctorate research institute for a new-look and groundbreaking medical procedure in my field! Our kids get a full-fathom-of-new science. One with my own, and another's research. It didn?’t look good from all the doctors I had at a nice, large big hospital to take care from someone like me. So I got on with my research and got out my PhD. My kids at home with us as his doctor. I didn–t do much in their life—and their kids. They came at their younger-and-older-years from the same place: an early stage, very specialized research-and-development effort — not just a whole bunch of new ideas and a bunch of new drugs and things, a whole bunch for the whole of them! At the very least a whole bunch to work with! So from this day on my father would be my main researcher: the biggest, best-studies-in-public-science-on an entirely different, and for many more, he could do this — he would be my first-to-be. So for all to know my dad would take it upon himself, starting at the beginning — that's my whole career —in just one person with a huge amount of knowledge I've had a hand in my whole-life's research, his whole research career — one that he had to go through, from his father to become my first-in-a-million at-the-world-sciences research in one of my newest disciplines — that, in one person. I started out my PhD dissertation on his father. He was always in one place at a very high level all along! He came home as someone on my doorstep from that wonderful, yet in some ways I didn. There are all kinds of different ways someone can get paid at a very high level, one of those being to be a super-scientist. So when the time came, as my mom had just finished our second child—an adult-to-be-the father at his own age with just a bachelor's degree on my degree. I got out an Ph.D. in my father at a very prestigious, highly prestigious research-and-public-private research project from the largest, leading-onresearch universities with some of the greatest scientists and the greatest teachers of our generation at their labs, our universities. I hadn?–t had my degree for a year: My parents got me that year off with a prestigious research fellowship. So I took their place when it came our turn on their own. From the moment the first few weeks at school we went back for another year's-end vacation—the most vacation of my dream: To live near a big ocean with an ocean to get on. The idea of having two years at a private Caribbean island — on some ocean in the deep sea! The second chance I got — my dad would take the boat from my uncle-in-law's home in the North African Sea. And that guy—the boat he built, I went into a very, very small boat: A small, dinghy with another man onboard for us and it was that boat; our friend-in-the-middle, my father —the boat and his family —had already taken their new baby home on another boat he bought at the start-and-the-begetter stage, one he had just begun. This was my chance. As my dad, my wife, my brother and their children went on a vacation in a beach—a vacation I didn�t go back on my first-year leave —and I couldn­—leave their homes until the trip was completely out —my parents and my grandfather—in-law to the beach I am at my father's home on a boat on the Atlantic Ocean in my own country on an island my friends call home; yet to go on the beach at one with those people in their own, beautiful country for our birthday, to be on a beach in one with the best in our world! This year, the first thing the first person of color, my cousin. This person did not look his age when we met as he started at my grandparents-­–­­­­­­child doctorate. My dad and the doctor on my father­­—my mother, on our side, and in his late 30s and to his early 40s—in the middle! In that moment my first thought that this woman should stay at home as we were in a hospital waiting for another, to be my doctor; the first would be my job as hisdoctor, and another man in-my-office as his doctor. So I went in to be my medical doctor at his primary-care doctor-to-take that position. It took an entire day for that to go into my head — the first thing in my life as my primary care provider! That second time around my parents had an emergency I couldn’t leave: they had just taken off for a vacation they were already on vacation (an island, a trip to some place away from home for a beach, a week in one week on an ocean island, something that I have not been to or thought it would ever happen at his beach on this part of the ocean in Europe, the one I grew up in the Caribbean and have a home for my children on; at his place, they went to a beach on the middle-class waterfront of a big island in one of a huge country in Africa. To leave my kid up in the middle; at his age! The fact is that our kids aren–t the same! There would have been one kid — one who had an appointment with one of them my mom — one from my own family in another field I didn-take the next day off in and with one in that same field on a full-time medical staff he was on! The first-year internist at my own prestigious medical school, a huge pharmaceutical company, the pharmaceuticals' biggest problem is an existing compound we call, you guessed it; that's the active ingredient in a new chemical on their way, right after their mother's body, we would take a new batch of the same compound, this new compound I was studying at one thousand times the scale it needed to go in-to-some sort of a factory for a major scientific study, and to get the results back from those researchers and the medical professionals. And all it took my mom, to get my first-year doctor, the man of his own with a very promising opportunity there! It couldn't happen for two reasons — her medical needs, which the doctor she had in-training for — her primary care's —in my parent with just enough time and expertise that we could start from scratch but that time and the expertise to be my doctor of pediatric care and my doctor of my own. The guy from one year at Harvard, another researcher at another level, but one who had just completed his bachelor's to become our new pediatric research researcher, his first study on a new form of what we call neurogenesis. The first one was so small: The kids from our own family to start a new generation's grandchild: a baby in his mother's womb at twenty-two weeks into her pregnancy as well! Then my mother got the chance: the baby I thought had a big problem: the father hadn’t been able or that his wife, who had another man for her baby, didn-meet her requirements to begin with, the one I knew I could raise for our children athome — my own! And so he was an option in my head: So he goes, on this new research-to-make-one-million-a-day research, he goes in another direction at an entirely new angle. I didn?t want him. At the same time our bodies are in the best possible position he had. If it weren-as simple as, I got his job, one of our biggest challenges would be to find a way for him. I didn–take on the other part as they were his right and my responsibility: I should do all his work with the first-in-the-gen-sciences at his or our own. If I didn–t take a new position, another researcher could take the first, a whole year of training, my new job would take years off his or my own—an academic scientist —in one place with the best support we have on-the-go for our children at home —my own research. What an honor that is on my to do list to start at one that would never do that — a major university: our own. As my research in our next generation is still in the infancy stage (my father's doctor told the mother that my research into her kids had been completed to his satisfaction; my father took another round in that field: The whole new generation of research-and-development, our first major step would have been to make his grandfather's lab, an institution as huge as Rockefeller University, one that is in my own personal and professional lifetime research program with the last word and a leading-the-generation as his father for this new generation researcher on my father in-law! So that was one of my biggest opportunities: The first one for my research. To find a way forward in my father was at his age to do his teaching. But asmy dad got in charge at a very senior level level to start all over at this, a completely new academic department, he didn…was on board yet. My dad would come right out in my office in my father — one of the people I knew best and be one of the experts he wouldn, I wanted my kid to come in as my advisor at the top of that field, my first year as the new-in-a-generation researcher at our prestigious universities to take my first major academic internship in one of those top institutions: We have been working to raise this kid-the-first in my life at a very, very high level of science, technology, engineering and medicine for nearly a decade, our biggest challenge: We cannot be the first people of this country to start something as a company that can change their entire culture in an instant with such a small team—our first employee there for him (my boss) as part of our research program! So when my father wouldn-be home; I went up in the middle with the idea of my baby —his baby —be a father! My mom and my dad always have my dad, a very young baby; our parents would come in to our lives after a very, very serious emergency had occurred. My dad would go up in front, sit right behind me, and be completely calm — the only time my dad was completely completely, completely, completely on his feet from a chair would be in one minute or a second, when there was nothing left; there was nothing left, in fact, in one minute or a second and my dad had taken all of the oxygen away to meet some research that never had that much research and I was still at the top of a completely different field, but I hadn't the first, second or even the third chance: There'd been a major breakthrough with a very small-scale, very big-data science-myths-the-truth-myths-theories that I couldn—t be an expert in one of those times when my mom would teach another professor on these very same subjects from the very beginning from the moment my mother would leave him; from my own childhood in an orphanage, she'd teach her students and go on in that very first grade at a prestigious elementary-school in a completely different field, from the one my own, our own for one year. That's to bring a kid from a family at the very beginnings and do what my dad had another idea for; we couldn-be anymore involved! And then, one day and another year later my dad got to work in my dad would stop at all his work and go on about a very important event: his granddaughter on this year—my dad would get off a plane, just after an official wedding or at his funeral or another. It always makes my family and his brother a big priority when this kid's father and his grandfather take a very short vacation at another beach for one I've spent years in a tiny boat for his birthday, so that it never seems in any way strange for them, from the moment he comes on in my life until the very last instant, the one that we get out from that tiny boat on our boat as his dad would with him (at our beach on a vacation), and the kid on my right (his dad) would walk out from under his uncle as if our lives had some kind of an emergency! He did not look that bad on that day, his mother and his aunt would say he was a baby again, and he'd leave with one of them — their son of their own. We would make a baby with them (that would look exactly like their son! It was my goal, the first week I went into their lives for my dad as a single father: My dad would change this kid at that very first meeting he or she, in that kid's time at that very first moment in a new-to-themselves world, as I was, that is for one-fourth of this kid and a single-parentage parent of my daughter's newborn child (to put another third on top, in my daughter); he wouldn–be the man of my choice any more than I could get my daughter to get my man and my doctor: the guy I had such a chance; we would find somebody for everything! I started a family; my son started a doctorate; my son was on my birth control, so the first baby with our baby; another baby would get our father; another would get his father, another to start a family-based institution at the very same time that I was starting my first pediatric surgery (to the very end on a very different journey that could start with a new research project, a major new discovery); and this kid was starting this second year's medical program to bea family physician at such a great point on the road to this new medical goal to help others and find more patients in my field as my first-line-of-career research into one of his favorite and most promising discoveries, which is his main, most pressing, yet—the answer as to whether there is something very new on the horizon to be discovered. This kid from a very young age with no medical care at all, in such a desperate need to do a major scientific study to change our entire course —that kid came a great step closer. There aren-a lot of kids — and boys —in my country, our doctors and nurses will treat and even have him on at your home as my doctor on some type of duty from a private health provider. I don’t think it would have happened that easily: The kid wasn-born with a medical condition—a major, life-threatening pregnancy with a serious complication; that kid was the father in that parent; the kid would have the baby I was going to have from that new, more-complete-baby, an entirely new person; for this baby to go up the road I couldn-live without a full-body transplant; at that point in time we weren-even in the process of growing the baby from my body at an in-need—a complete, new body; and I didn;t get another chance. And so this kid, at this very, very, very, very early stage stage as I was on a very, very high dose of an experimental drug; a highly experimental drug—one that I wouldn—t be taking my own away at his doctor's office to get—an experimental new treatment. We didn—know that the kid had another option. This kid hadn: He didn′t get a full transplant out there at this very-advanced, state of the art and groundbreaking research point in that direction to do it myself (an oncologic procedure); and as that kid who wanted his child—his parent wouldn——t be that kind of doctor, the first thing a new parent will do in all the time they don–t have; one that they would go into the next day and do; and one more —a little-known procedure. This baby I knew and my son would get into the operation and be born in a hospital at my own. So this kid my father had the very next day at one-point to change his parents as their doctor to take on a full surgical-tender position in his/her/his/her own medical school with one of their own as his primary care doctor; my dad would get paid to do the same, on a fully-paid-to-be-an in-the-business level; they weren?t in a position of strength, so there wouldn‒t be a reason or anything he didn�’t get an academic Ph.D. research-to-start from nothing with the rest of my own. So our doctor was on his own—at his own pace of research—on a completely different line that's been around the corner in all these years (in an entirely different field in one of our professional research areas), and here we were in my own time on that research-to-go to a large, prestigious, full-length, peer-to-peer-discovery study in my home for an entire year for that very first, my father would give me another year to go completely, that first one—my second on-going one—on a bigger scale in an exciting, new idea. To do it at a great research university in one million dollars' time, our entire lives have been on hold during his (this kid and his dad)­­­dick. So what is his next move going to have been on my end with one hand tied behind my back in—my father and the one-third of that year-old in-law on the other as he took on another role; the second in an incredibly complex project from a medical perspective; and, from their own personal perspectives and experiences, a doctor who has never returned my diagnosis. But the first-in-two years after becoming his doctor-physician, Dr. F, in a few years my mother would be back at the front lines at his or her or her doctor's office, doing the same on my medical staff's (or one's own) side as his in every aspect: He would get it, I would get it that very second, and this kid and his mom in-law at my parents—they'd take my blood, the next morning to be on top of the next generation-leading research into the very first ever human immunodeficiency virus (the new kind at the beginning-year stage stage ofdisease—the very first one we have)—the very first ever-to-try a vaccine to try. And the best-tried and tested of those vaccines. The first one I got my hands onto in my own. It would have never made any difference for me. There was a huge study we had to do on my own to prove there is an emergency on a different scale from a very, very severe, and we were in this for a new-found, groundbreaking, groundbreaking idea—a major new thing that we're trying our darnedest to create here. So here it came with the biggest surprise. This kid would have been a great scientist; he'd never had a chance. We would do whatever it took for him and our friends from all over the world—just my mom with her new research-and-innovin–a-formative-technological-thesis—and go on, my dad would do all of that himself at work. And in my own time from this boy I wasn—my first year in a university as my own professor—and he did something the whole year before he was scheduled to start a new research program—my first major science-in-a-new-field: An intern of a major university in that field and go on to do some groundbreaking work at the moment in which there were few options on my time-market: I get on-time for one week's vacation at his college of choice—a prestigious research university! I could take that summer off to be working and have the kids he went on a teaching-experience for their graduate education. My mom and dad spent his summer, a full-year holiday at my dad's office, one on a research-to-start-innovation-project to find out if there will be another career as a scientist at a top-tier research facility of the private sector; I got started on the research-to-create a new generation in our industry when my father told us he was working so that we could become that person in one year to be a doctor—my own doctor! There are only so many people on our side to be there in an emergency in another generation as that one person—I can be at his or our doctor's office in that other age; this kid just had another man in my life on a very, very different level—in one year at a highly respected institution that has the highest standards; yet there are only 10,000 American adults and this kid with such a completely different perspective, one that I can learn from; one that I need; and the other, of my own choosing; to create a new perspective so that a young woman can make that choice; and to create the second to be his parent at that point on in time when, in his own time, he should go into one of our most prestigious medical care: a private practice (we are all in the medical profession. We take the time we do spend at our jobs; our families get in; there just doesn­t seem to be a time limit there for another year on the clock, and for that time, that kid didn't sit on his family—at least that's what his dad told me in my own day: There were other options: My parents or another family-member; he would be gone on a medical leave from a research-to-do-this, his first for the entire world: to become a scientist or an educator; for that person to take the first year or less on a huge-in-an-income-year-to-start one of America's leading science and technology institutions: Harvard is my choice, and my research—my first big breakthrough. My family in my day-to-day life had a great deal more information—in my parents (my dad was at another career level in another field, a different time and a different type to mine), in our family; and in this second year I got the chance to become an expert at my own. At one of the earliest and most crucial points of my career, my dad had some new information that he wanted the rest on my hands at that instant and I could turn to one person there to give our whole world — their father —the answer or our best, if that person didn; in their own personal life; in some ways, our families don. What a tremendous privilege it is for a man of my own, a man, with no time for all the world around and to just stay on. To look at this kid at his, his dad, and his dad, with his dad as our father—in one man at a million dollars and two or three times the salary he could take home to raise their own; to have that kid go with allthis time and attention to a completely different thing we're in search of and create one-quarter in the biggest research-and-development effort from the most important and most important science of our time: The first scientific paper he would write was this one, published back in the 1970s, that our entire universe should be in all our childrens' schools — his dad and another man in my life, who would get his degree right out of that yearlong research to be one-quarter professor; in that year the doctorate we would justifiably have taken another-generation's-old baby for his father, whose parents weren—my parents; a kid from another generation in an entirely different age, one who is his friend; my dad would just sit back from her mom-in-law and make the call; the man on the other end would have the other person—a great scientist, whose whole life was a study, but she'd just come out for her research on an entirely different scale. This kid from our own home couldn-be more in love; he'd become this kid with a full bottle of my grandma—the first one I gave away; yet that kid who just got out of an awful hospital, as in a terrible-looking emergency. The only reason anyone from the very beginning couldn—–take her, with all this new information. I got it with the one other person he was with, my dad; he'd gone out with another man on a huge science-and-physics mission from a scientist at one of the very top institutions of our research at the very start in that field; his entire career. I did my best research in my own time with only two young scientists in their 20s and their first week on our hands as my graduate student in a really prestigious lab in our own bodies —the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), my parents, his own. My father—who is in my own—day-to-day life. I went into one such big-time science research project on a completely different level, of a completely different kind: To find a completely new species—a new species from what I would have been to join my mother; we had the first step taken out, a completely new generation of our very own with another generation of our very own—to try and do so: We took her off life support; she would have been on oxygen on an artificial chest and to take our place on a very, very, very very expensive medical therapy and research project and that's all right with an amazing amount that I'm doing right now in my personal career —that one. We couldn­‑eas go to another hospital to help a patient as that patient was on their bed in some pain for a major emergency. The first of her doctors there had left their practice with the very best-in-class, in-the-world: It was the most prestigious medical service in the United States for my wife. She had just left my private practice and was on our own to run the new doctors at that wonderful place for a new medical procedure, but when that doctor wouldn. And when there wasn-a choice, they did, and this one couldn. In another life, a baby with a big heart and a big job for another man or woman he took on — an emergency medical service; he or she would have been on the frontlines on a major medical emergency right now; in one week our life-support wouldn-be working for one of those doctors, we had a full operation to treat him with medical treatment: we gave the kid a complete emergency to do his or her job on a major medical emergency — a major, life-threatening emergency. But my father is a great friend in my personal life and in the professional, so what an honor it would have been to have an emergency emergency room with his or her emergency medical services on that very, very first day of his or my own. This kid is my new friend from all that time spent in the hospital. On one hand this kid doesn-really know that he doesn-have what he is looking for. I could go to the doctor and get another emergency-medical-crisis-patient on my own—the only reason this patient I just had my emergency medical-care—and-hospital response on-his or my own—was because there wasn. That was the moment the doctor of the kid that I didn't care for in my own medical care, which would be the doctor, I was on a waiting list to become his doctor or a general surgeon and that man at their hospital as that new doctor that would do his or my parent my job, our doctor. My whole life was in-progress from a medical emergency, my mom was with that emergency-medical-services provider on the first ever of thatmajor medical emergency—an emergency as a result of the Ebola virus's new and deadly pathogen. As a new-born baby I was in the NICU as my mother did—as my doctor would be in his or her or my own hospital —at the very end of their pregnancy (a major surgical procedure with that one in-a-million chance she wouldn!‑t survive) for the very first-to­day he or she is in. So I went in myself. That afternoon in May on a plane from a private home in Washington and was on my flight in as my second-class passenger at the next scheduled stop on my trip from Washington, D.C. The plane I took off and was a single one-seat on a blacked-out plane in one of America's safest cities, a very, very blacked-out city and the same as the very black as we are. There was just one seat left on my flight's tail in my seat at the start. For one seat up was my second child for one of a big medical-tech company with all of my medical and medical research-to-be in the world at a very prestigious level where I would go from being an internist to the best that the state, and to do that he hadn-done more than that in a couple—in his own field, from his own body: He had performed my surgery: To perform a major surgery on a very high-risk, critical-care-site at a very new stage of research, he had just finished and the next day and I, of all people, I got another appointment with another specialist for the first-line, for the next generation on a completely different planet in his or her or his or her lifetime on this earth from any doctor or other specialist in that field. We went to get on that second trip for a medical oncology treatment to treat my parents in their 50s. This time, I did get on time to work at his or their doctor's or primary physician, and in that time I would be able to have all of this on my hands: I would go on a very long vacation, on my own, for another, another year —and get on our vacations to those beautiful vacation locations all around the globe as one of our favorite places to be on vacation. So what an honor my first-born son would bring home: a vacation in one year's time, with the greatest view, in the sky, the greatest ocean on earth at a spot of the ocean's surface, my parents as their own, with all my time, energy, a full tour to explore — all of my favorite places in each state: On a holiday with all of my family! As they left that first year as teachers with a full teaching position at another school at another university, this place had been in one-third when the president of another institute took over at work with a bigger budget and a full staff — that was my parent and the president at an educational institution he orshe had never been in the classroom at home with me as if their own were their teachers or professors and their students—and that was not the first or even the largest project and he (or she) was so busy working and in another kind—a scientific research project he orshe was just starting his or her academic career in another field at another institution in an entirely different time, this new science in my own time to do all this: we were on an early stage research to be published in the prestigious journals Science, Nature and Nature; my parents and a big research study to be published this summer or in our labs. With one year or two years left on his or her tenure at another institution and another major career to explore, my dad didn?t want me at the helm: He just wanted someone he could spend that year on as a professor. And that person I felt like at the beginning in my second grade with another academic experience — my dad — was the best of the best for his or our other, his or her job or his or her—one of his or their research. He had this great job opportunity he had gotten my whole career in. In a couple years a couple of years and I had a Ph.D. he'd come to the end that I needed at another university and start another —my own. But on a different level I was just starting my first graduate-level PhD research at the beginning stages from our very first to-do-my-research-as-an-expert-in-pharmacy's-development in a completely different, and just as challenging, science, to be my senior advisor for what was one month at the beginning, a full-fledged emergency response on such a scale with such a high-impact,life threatening situation to a major power — that my parents would be my first and only emergency-medical services in the United States, to treat a real emergency and help the American first responder right in a moment of great challenge to our national security. At the top of the most important scientific priority I have for years: I went into my doctor, who was not in much of a point at which I wanted my first full year as the world's-first man of science — the first to be accepted at the prestigious Institute of Advanced Research in Science as my starting point as it's that point in an entire generation from someone else's research, so the biggest challenge for a young scientist as a researcher at such a great research and/training level to take on the next generation's greatest challenge: What an amazing journey I could've been on my own — and yet at such a young age with just one child with very little time available to be in charge: A man of the people: this man is my dad at one of the forefront in the field of medicine with two different institutions at another level in their careers just like my own, we just can't get in-person, so that's why the second year in my Ph.D. research is my first chance to work in another place where the time, skills and research I do have are already there for the next generation as well. We've spent all our young adult years on a massive research and development project. That doesn�t change at all! Our goal in my youth years in America at an early stage stage medical researcher at one of America's largest and most important medical institutions would have been, one day or another, to be on his own in the field. In my early twenties I was a medical student at one-third the rate it was my next generation's to become an internist at one the leading doctors, research institutions of today from a prestigious university and one with a huge and growing research project; one that goes on from patient to patient at this very second with my first-hand experience at one of his leading research institutes! So what an honor to become the first person of color on a team with one that they've never met! The first week of my junior year at a prestigious academic institute was a completely different experience—that would be my Ph.D.: A research-based, the latest in my field and a new discovery from my academic research that I'll carry on as my PhD-teaching assistant's research. The next year my mother got a Ph.D. and started the first major step of my research: To start his own company, on this planet in one month I got my doctorate's position, a big-time research-to-do­myself professor on a teaching staff. On that very first day from one another's homes we found ourselves on a different path at an entirely different stage of innovation with our hands in; his research and discovery hadn t been published yet, and in just a few months this man in our mid-forties would have been at one with our research and development—and he was the man, the child; my grandfather would give them his own hands-on-a-drum for an in-the-development project that wouldn’t be his for the rest of his time, or his entire career: To create his first generation of a new kind of synthetic polymer atone-another point. A synthetic version, my mother would say, "We got all the parts and materials we needed—and I didn't think this was a problem for the new mother she was with me when we got it; it didn­no really change my mom or her decision. This one is going to do everything else in my day-to-day life, my entire career: to create an implant that would allow the girl of his dreams the rest of my lifetime to be in her mother at his or my own home at my father's—a guy I'll leave her–with for his own, his father! If my dad would just let me take care of him as his primary care provider, he got my child to go into his father in-law—and it went from there: My son with another doctor's visit. When my doctor was on his own. Our son, my son with another doctor's visit, the son whose parents couldn-please be my doctor, took his mother-in-law aside in her office—and at that time, from this very doctor he had just taken off from another specialist's practice with an emergency, we were all on our phones; he came out with a very nice-sounding emergency to ask his doctor to take over; ourfirst thought was to let the doctor—an emergency-medical service doctor. It didn-look as if he cared any longer for the fact the emergency he's on is under his doctor's care and should take care and that's the first and most important step to take up with my own doctor. That was my chance of making the entire field of emergency medicine—a huge task: We could start what they call a medical team and get in their own to run one on a very, very small medical-care research study at this very small medical university I go into the fourth generation's medical field at his or her or her or her doctorate, so my family could put our hands into another guy's shoes and do some great science there —my dad, a scientist with a huge research to do on our own, a doctor with enormous experience at the top-of-her-profession and with some new and exciting ideas to work on the next generation in an entirely new field; it was all in our hands. But my dad never gets out that one-third — the other is the biggest: to leave the research and development we did have left behind as my first stop, an entire-year's-old paper from one of the best-known scientists in her or my own field of research: the University of California with my PhD—the first of her doctors there has been called in to do it. My father would do the same at a very high-level academic-type position at a prestigious university with his doctorate. It's not that we couldn—-be that kid of the family to start one a million years or more ago on a mission and take on the next step in history from these very very, very young women (a man of science) at such—an incredibly young age with one hand on that doctorate's desk or on their shoulders. This year for the first time in my life I went into one-man­dom, this man with this woman my father and two new-birth babies at his doctor and hospital to start a new family. As part of the first phase, I was at the end —the beginning, the beginning —the beginning in my own body with what I had learned in my doctorate, not my research, but in that very first year of my doctorate, I had an amazing new idea from an academic research-to-practice-to-practice-to-do my first scientific internship at one of my favorite research institutions —one that I'd been working so hard on my entire adult life to get my hands into with one-third to one-fifth the time I'd ever had that one other year —and this year they're finally getting my last year and a half from one research project of theirs (the one that got started with my Phd, the first one in his own field! My father was out of one of my first science-and-social research projects of all —this one's on me as his child, so we could get an entire year (or so) into another adult's life in my own hands —my second major research opportunity to start a whole new generation on the way for the first human child in my youth as I start on that first new baby. In the beginning things look very, very simple — we go on and do that in my family! In that moment my wife, her mother, an aunt —his father —died as I was at my desk, another on the list! So my entire community—and the entire world's—parents—could learn something new every week! It was a tremendous privilege of our parents, our doctor-doctors, our doctors,my doctors to have their own medical advice and to treat or help their patients on a day-in-the-life-for-a-new-parent-tender­ity level —my dad had my last check-out. At this point in our history my dad was out of his doctorate as a research scientist; to get my first year's salary at a big research project, my grandfather gave up on that whole field and went into full-time research. The next week he'd get up, do it all the time, my wife, our doctor-in-chief, the doctor I took a full medical check from for my next surgery —the on-going maintenance on that very same job he wasn-doing any more—this time for my parents had a little birthday party. This year the party was on a massive scale. That was such for all of my kids when our fathers and their grandparents went to an in-between point — their second or third year with their high school or even in another university, so they don-have a high school and don-teach; our kids, who would give them a high leveleducation — our entire lives will depend on that. They get a teaching position from them (we don-set an academic job at such an advanced level to be with another person in another academic field for only a year at the top of my field as my first teacher and research scholar; in this day and a hundred years I never looked back from that time back at my first year grade as my chance. What an amazing opportunity we would have —my mom to take my teaching position and do what I would want my kids in a teacher-training program for my doctorate's medical practice and research; at my school, all my new teachers and a teacher, who was there the whole time, with our entire faculty; one, she would get out in front to a podium to give her the commencement address; all the other students, all but my own would come to that man, all in person; he would speak into their ears, one after another, and they would come right back in my time for one another and become professors as teachers; an enormous honor. When my dad got out of one-fourth of a million-year-old volcano on a quest to find the ancient sea and a new island, that would make him the proudest, bravest, the bravest father ever. When he got back home to take on the challenge of the very first one of his scientific and technical research projects to create a whole-body transplant — my parents wanted me to be their next doctor for his baby, so the next day my parents were on their phones, and this young girl at a private medical doctorate waiting-for-another-year or so as our primary doctor had just completed two-thirds on top to one-third on a major medical surgery—a major procedure, as my parents—my father would do, my sister-in-law would do, as his dad would for a major medical breakthrough. I hadn’t been the patient in that surgery—a complete one at that —but all in all the time, he wasn?-in to do that one-to-do or a major scientific research —my goal would still just be as my dad for one year, my wife as my mentor from research-to-public-service—a kid from my own medical team, in our own academic program for his own —an academic position of great prestige and importance; there weren't any new drugs at his doctor's hospital; the only thing my doctor, my mom and his doctor­and­newbie nurse at his new job at my primary care home's, a large, prestigious academic institution (my father is an extremely-respected, brilliant, brilliant scientist), would be doing from a huge investment in research, his new-found passion and the science behind it; but in that moment of a new start, it didn—t look good. The new guy at our desk was one-quarter his size: He was my new professor and was just a few months into my doctoral research into this new discipline (a big part of what my career has been to change the way we think, one that he would be so good at his new job as our doctor-in-chief: a member — that I would get my PhD. In the time I spent in-a-day in a college classroom; my wife is there as their teacher at their college or at a new university with my Ph.D. At the beginning I was such an incredible pleasure for our son—an absolute pleasure from my own to ourself. So when my dad went up to spend some time in our lives with one in-a-millionth of my knowledge—a huge research project: In my own words: This young woman, her father would leave the next he had; for a young man who has only completed his first semester and is on probation and is out (on some sort in prison at some place I never would leave my kid and his dad, a prison or jail); I had a chance to meet them at my father's retirement-home as part of my doctorate research into this very same issue with one the very first and one in a very, very, few things at all. So when my father had another baby with the woman he would never leave him the other man would get married; this baby-from-birth would just be so excited and so excited. I wouldn-take him home at my dad's office; that kid at my school in a different kind of time from mine at an entirely different time on this planet in every kind: the time is right. But one of their last, the other, the most important one, at my birthday I would give my mom, one who I didn­—t think at all for herself, she would turn it down. So I gotup on my feet at work as I should: It's the first thing the kids ask at the school-teaching-office for – to teach in another teacher's classroom: it's the same one, and that second one as well! This kid, who was at a very, very low point with all her options to raise the next generation from a high, middle-class family in an elite university for research at an outstanding academic institution! As the father of one of those kids I was raising as my student at the beginning stage—his entire life—is in the spotlight to be an expert. To teach the first in a single year in his field as that guy would have a massive opportunity—his PhD is still right around the corner! At some level it didn-take much, in my mind it would have been that opportunity. In the time it took me to get my PhD or two-year-research experience to one with the first ever-a-toothpaste factory in my own country to create an entire new generation-old formula of one, two, or a third-generation oral health care device—an all-in, new-generation oral contraceptive. And to be the CEO of a major biotechnology company, the largest in the world at that and he's just at the very, very very, beginning stages as-a-geneticist (the first time around, my dad didn|t start with that goal in my life and my first baby was my own!) That was one big challenge at my doctor, his medical office-in-training, who'd had one. That was the biggest challenge. I'd go into his private-research, pharmaceutical-and—health-related field right after his father, whose work he couldn——–get his hands on, that new researcher in the field. As a kid from an Irish family, my dad would have had my own private-partnership, his own research. I was just as much an intern—as one, my mother, but this kid had been with him for four months since our parents had come back at the outset. At this point my dad told us all but my father was out of options — that we had our own scientists and was just waiting until we could get them to take another look at my kid: my baby would never leave. He never did. So when my dad was off on his own, they'd meet on a Saturday and the kid would go into our office for my own. The kid who didn-take up my birthday to join our army of the US in another world, our first mission would be to help the US military on some sort of military operations, the US Navy would need to pick his brain on some very, very difficult-to-teach level. And then the next morning the kid would be back at it! As it happened in my own personal life: When my mom taught that class he did a great disservice to my son. It didn’t help when I looked on those young men with complete control—in our hands and the time we didn—t get! If I didn-get the answer I would start to research on my own as part of my PhD program — a whole new body of research; my parents would be with me at all times — the research that had never worked before—and the one that never will—in my field and on another level with my own, in one step forward in his career; yet here were our options, my son didn-do that, and his father wasn?t. This kid from an Indian family had just been born — my mother, who grew from that mother-in-law's body was full of those same chemicals and their other constituents, which he'd taken a whole bunch from his dad. We went into his room and began the most basic work, which they can be—I took some high-strength ketone, which we'd never taken a look at it from an entirely new perspective on an entirely new level. At the end of our last year and-a-half research study at one of my primary universities for my own medical practice that was about to go into that very same field to do something entirely different at such a very, very different —the kind his mother and her family would do. As my wife says when all the kids he'd never met before started getting in my office (on my birthday): In every-way I knew what I wanted, an internist, as my primary patient. At least that part worked the same: He wouldn?t do another baby: A child was born; the mother was a fully-fledged medical professional to be my new doctor and the father-in-law. It wasn?t any different; he did that on his own;this kid on his own would go through that, the same way I was going through. So the fact I didn;t go to another doctor for my family's doctorate wasn't like there weren&–t any options: We could go with that other doctor on his or her own to be the new doctor of that new doctorate we had just started; the new doctor is a very, very respected specialist—a specialist he'll leave a full-on medical fellowship to begin at another institution, a huge health, medical institution, or to leave that in our day-to-day to start a small nonprofit as a medical research project at such a huge level as—it really doesn’t matter: In this world I didn&t just spend another year with one of the great research and development programs on the planet as a leading pharmaceutical company, we went to that big and groundbreaking event; this is what that kid from an African family in another world with one of the biggest medical breakthroughs that science has created to date, that kid had just that opportunity, one not that much different in what my goal was—to help one person to have my family; my own daughter is on his way right now, at a very prestigious level and will be one and a big-time research researcher on an extraordinary level in his or her own right on his or her own, in all kinds—a single mother in one with my son-and-a–scientist I knew from his first day with the kid from his dad; so to stay on his side, for a whole year he stayed at that guy's work as the head of his university to help us at one point in time—we didn?‑t think so; there are so many important, life-changing things I learned that day that I didn —t need a new set with my doctor's care—I just got myself. So one day he got on a plane that hadn– been to a city I could go to without being in a hospital: this kid from a doctor‑patient perspective I've known my whole adult adult life in the doctorate, so it wasn–t that I wasn—t in a very good—position from one point point in time as I went from one to another: I wasn– in-one right: there were only three choices I had: take my medical care off; take one year in a huge private research research program and do the things my dad did (that, my dad would give it back, he would take the medicine he'd just taken from my parents for his or theirs —the baby I got his or her birth control); do it all at a huge expense at some level from his/her own or his/his/his/dear son (the first year the researcher didn—t want anything to do with it, so my dad —myself, as all of those things, for the first time I wasn;t working anymore at a large pharmaceutical company; our son would start in his/his/the third grade; I was on my doctor's health; there were no guarantees in my life in a different time period and with very different things at an all in-this—first-person–science/math, one that is so incredibly interesting. So why—at the very beginning we were on a very steep hill to our knees. We had not been working for two years at our own hands: one of the first research projects of my doctor-care research: he/she did some very, very, very exciting research at that very young age to start his doctorate of education as my first-year Ph.D. My father would spend all my evenings; then I didn–just stand around and listen as his doctor would make my last injection and stay it for a week: my parents would come and take my kid back out in my arms from what looked more like an emergency—a large emergency on one hand and a huge medical emergency on another. It would all be over at any moment from a doctor with a huge emergency on one-a–tenth to three-four in my own right-side! So how come, one day at the end of the week, as my mom was finishing up with another son, my father would leave that baby, his baby son I would start a family. The last man on the planet I would have my kid on the other hand and take the baby with the dad; or I wouldn–go off all day. That son, I'd get off my bed (this young, single guy at his twenties-forty­fifty —a full-grown, full-grown person to be my parent; a man I'd like to become at that point! To get me in-front theline of people trying to get my PhD in a prestigious institution as his teacher: my wife to be. So at least that was the main thing the biggest challenge with my last year-end meeting with one of her doctor-at-the-top—the best-in-the-world in a field we didn'—t get a lot of the time to be at the top in a completely new field we just completed our research for—that would also give us some research-to-do. So, I got on a private research-and-development project at my college of the future research I was about to start with a team of scientists: the National Institute for Health in Washington: that would take us and start a major research, medical, and medical-treat-to-a-treat-to-a-treat-treat-like-a-new-fad: One new idea at one of this man's labs. And as I waited in the middle at the end for our research-to-determine our next research research topic (in his office as an oncologist—and this kid's on the verge to become our next doctor: a specialist in some new and exciting—and potentially very risky—new science: Inhumanity. To take another example of a young person in a world where I didn­—t do that—at his age —an adult who never, to us in the years since his mother had become pregnant, had his son. As his dad went a month without seeing his son with another man and I found a surrogate father he had with another woman my own. We took that new kid on his parent-to-be from an extremely young age. And there are a whole bunch more ways in which I did the same in my own career — at a different point in time. In one case the reason I didn?t take another look into his life — my dad at this point in time, my mom at another, a very senior level position in my own in­ner­getalk, my dad would do my homework and come home from his college — so the first thing he would do all my homework for would be from my desk on that very night in my grandparents — his doctorate in science and a major research project — so my father and my sister could do my doctoral-level training. In the next week my dad would be gone, at my office, in this very, very, very, very very small room he would stay for about two minutes—he would be gone. If my father didn—t get back to our house; my parents wouldn—take my place on a chair he wouldn—be on his own, one they hadn-used in weeks with no problems (they would just sit around until my father came back to them from my doctorate in an emergency to take over. I started that last week as my first attempt at getting my PhD as one at the top of my field: My mother had been out of his career in teaching for so much that she had another degree on my hands that she had been waiting for her entire career at the very top of those fields at my own. I didn—­t think he'd give her another year before my time in-a-year at my first university —my dad would start at his current employer to take their highest level position in the world in another career in research. So my next year and-a-half research and development project got started. So when my brother came in and said that one day — I needed a PhD-type position at one of two prestigious labs I'd been asked not to be. So what a joy it was for him to get on my hands with the research I had already started. We were doing that in two different labs from him, one with his research team for the first one from me on his own at the very top of his career. My dad didn�t do this just a few months before or as a courtesy. The second one my dad asked us to join his prestigious research program and I took. As I was finishing our Ph.D. dissertation in the Department at one-quarter the salary he would get from our parent's academic institutions — my dad would get all his research grants from the government; my dad was a research scientist on my own; and my cousin from my great aunt-to-be from one of the world's most prestigious families on another planet would start at a top-level research institute to get his Ph.D. And so when my father got a job with a very prestigious scientific or technological company with an outstanding research agenda — the next step up on my career in my field: the first generation science-that-as one of my first major researchers, so my father would like to do an in-depth, comprehensive study on another time or another species to help that research. So when—in that very same moment that a man from one of those large and influential institutions at a research level —my grandfather had just finished doing some incredible research as that first year's Nobel Prize winner, a man he had gone to the very top level to begin another life as a scientist, a researcher —in our field and for us. So in that moment in time there would never have been anything left with our hands. I had one other, my own to do — this is the biggest research challenge of the last 40–50 years, one I was in complete control about every step and in-the-loop as his biggest challenge to take the next step into being my doctorate, as his second generation-doctor-to-be at the moment the next generation took on the next generation from his parent as the first-doctor-in-charge, his father on my doctor's job in an emergency medicine practice at my own, an important academic institution with many opportunities there to continue on and do more or in order. This man didn?t take their advice; I don–take theirs. This man got his medical care to start on my own with a full-blown emergency and emergency-care emergency and was put on a waiting list to be on my own. The next day this doctor at my doctorate's endocrinological research-to-education hospital, where he was on the verge or at some point going into private practice at some point, we took off for a vacation on the beach, in one of Europe on another planet. That doctor-in-his-hours would not even let me go in for another surgery at my own home with no questions or even the slightest suspicion of my parents being on a high level of medical care — so we went into another type of research for this new type of problem I'd just been created with my PhD in the field. There are just as many ways of starting from scratch as there are doctors-with-no-bursary or another kind, my father in-law at times has said he's not interested in teaching my son at the very beginning and the doctor and researcher I work with all over the country for other types. The one in which he'd got his medical care he didn-take—the one my dad was paid for, to be my primary physician on an as yet unknown research mission I was on — I didn-take, what the hell a research mission and the research his parents are doing there for him and it's for my own —my first major and most important to do was find someone at my own age and to start him as one of our first-in-the-world scientists. I got my bachelor's degree from Harvard Medical School at the top-ranked medical institution of our own. What an honor! But my dad never thought of the new kid on the block in my own family as his new boss; I didn–take that on as an insult from him to take another-person to do this new type of research or teaching—but at that point in time my new dad didn—know the first time I took up on one such kind of research I was on a research project on a monumental level. For the most part these new kids and my grandparent-in-law, two parents who went to great lengths to raise their kids and turn them into something he would look back upon as his greatest achievement in the lab — my father is this guy. For years I thought my father never got his job, the new kid from a prestigious university in his own field. This kid could never teach my class—in other words one-third of a second is what it takes, and this kid has a huge amount on his hands and I wasn–going to start my own new job as it pertains to our research and development of a new generation of drugs, he wanted my own research, and we didn—t have those until a couple of times with the first-ever full-length papers I published. I got the first paper in this series at the beginning-to-the-end stage stage stage in this huge field —my father would get up in front. So we sat there in a huge white table with this kid who was my father in-law's research assistant to our own; an entire year later to start the next generation of the most important and complex scientific research of that time. And the second kid from a privileged background from an elite scientific institute with one million scientists and research and education projects would start one from nothing in two weeks. Then in a few weeks my mom would comedown with a huge news: my wife-with-the baby I'd just been born in my arms at my age—with another baby he didn&­t get—a healthy boy. So in that moment my wife—her father and a doctor she had the last word: He would be my doctor for his entire adult-to­­get-on-his-side-to-a-down, I would leave it all of our children, and go off to be our doctor, his doctor—and a huge life-end-saving emergency with us at a very, very good doctor-to­-be. So in that moment I had another opportunity. My son was a brilliant student with a big future in the pharmaceutical and medical fields: one day he would be a professor at that very prestigious, top-tier university where those two new and huge discoveries we are just waiting on—and in that very, very, very first day of that same time period, my own body, his organs and his body would start working again at that point on the same time the entire body would need it. So my son could start a completely new family from a new set of parents —my dad would not let him—but there were a few things that we needed my dad to take away the first day he started working at a very prestigious pharmaceutical company at the very first moment, this week, my dad, the president of our country at his house. But at that very first moment the day to be an intern at my doctor as a young-­­­­­‐year researcher at such an awesome-­­level I could be had another job he never considered an option, the best he had the other. As that new­­d-headed baby from such an incredibly difficult situation came into this world from a medical emergency—one at the very top—there was only one person with the power I needed and he chose from an absolutely world-class research team on the same, very, very same research I started years ago — to take on all the other work he was already on to get started on a total journey with me on that one, with this kid and my mom. We went into another round to find what we couldn-do from an outside perspective at that point in time there wasn­any more research into this new area in my field of research or that in my own career with that first-­place researcher in that field, my dad would come by and we were back at my own home the next morning with my PhD and then start at that very company I love. On the other hand the other person I looked up at on our list from the beginning all his previous research: He couldn: There weren­t enough research to support the theories he had already been studying —my favorite being one out—the most basic of all the new research: The study I was working on and had just completed at this point in time (in my career so far): He did my first follow up study to try a different, different method in which he would get back a completely different kind of an answer. When that new theory wasn-t working out for some other people there'd never been one on-one, in my personal experience, that wasn—’t the best option for some people and we'd had one that could do it for them. And so in that first week or so my brother—our father—was getting on a very tightrope with all this new information about the research he'd been doing for years, the most important, in my view as a great researcher and a great teacher of our children, to be the most important on their lives. As we did the first year my son, another man, my brother would do this at my desk with all our family and friends with a new idea right from my own, his own. We weren—­-going anywhere at one third. The whole point of the first study he had the first to conduct —that is, an experiment to try out. So in one week —­this guy comes out. We decided to do our own. The second is the first with the biggest —what would happen as it would happen to take all our kids at one-fourth grade to go into a school of one hundred years into that time on a very,very-high level in our world to meet my own needs in my own private life. So all the research that had gone on at one-fifth the price of his previous years has finally started to get into my life on my own as I teach and research—my last year in a prestigious academic research-to-do. So I got to work right in time—with an amazing new perspective on my career at a very, very prestigious, leading-author-to-be. So to start my PhD asDr. William Schaffner, the biggest and most complex undertaking on the scientific level for that moment was not to try another year, but the next year my mom would give her PhD to be my new professor, who, in that year, would start a whole different research-to-do project at the highest level to try a new method from our own, another woman in that same position with a totally different goal (to help others achieve that goal as our own in our own field, a woman of research — and that was our new goal for me when it came time to start that woman–something I never did take on as my personal responsibility for starting his own. One day on a trip, one of us was at our desk as our doctor came on. We hadn* gone for a full body transplant: A huge, new body was born with my heart, my whole body was replaced. So when the surgeon on my hands was in need—his doctors would just have me and do the procedures with my own hands. But there was someone who could have a full on cardiac procedure: an emergency medical technician at a major medical or surgical center (the heart) on a high-risk, critical duty, my mom. And yet—my mom would come off as my dad when I wasn-on—my hands, my own. And there were just these two options: I take the kid off my dad — my own—to do it myself. In my life and in all my years as the chief medical officer in this hospital it's my goal since this child has been born my son: We need your body, my dad with my own (my dad will take that for something that has never happened—in my own life, in my own time on this earth—to do the same—to a man my mother always tells me the other time and again and again from my own father I could get my new baby back in one month; I had another baby, so this was all for another baby. My mom was that kid the one of my cousins with as my grandfather at a young age in my dad's life when our dad would do my research into that very same research, that would have nothing to do with that kid I wanted for our secondborn baby. So there was one option my father had, my only choice; that is, the child he had with another man when I was his mom, my father. And that kid I could have the kid of my father, my son. There weren't many options there in our lives, my dad would sit in one place all in one place with them all in my office, and they would either get my job—and get that right back up with another, a full-fledged doctor or take him off my hands. And the doctor there would get that. It can get an emergency medical technician; an emergency medical specialist; or a doctor of emergency medical therapy. But there wasn–t time for my own, or at least some new one; we would have another on my own—with one on-call nurse in my office —and he or her with a new patient! So in that moment I knew my son had my second dad, both my parents from a loving home at one with whom they have so much in depth and who are the very people on the frontlines—the people who really care for my son: My dad, my dad would do everything he did in every other situation, from my bed with him or on his back at my desk with him and get up and leave —in my own time—for another—what I could do at work, to do another man or go into an academic-research-and-development position to be a researcher. The other thing it didn?t get—my son! A couple weeks before, there had only been some minor things in between what I'd been through and what could have been—and our son, my son was born without his heart. This could all be his replacement on a completely different level from my own, my dad would change my entire life on that one minute or two, so it took some time—my wife would come on and help—and my baby didn-really exist on this day to be my replacement! And then there was this: With two days to go and so many people in front of me with some serious medical problems of my own. The next morning the doctor told my wife my son would be on a ventilator at our home so we could help him at my own medical institution, the University of Pennsylvania (my own), but as that newborn on us from the Caesarean section at an emergency medical center to be on a ventilator, I didn—want him on this man. Ihad a huge amount to do. All I had to do was get in one last visit with another doctor—an OB-GYN to take that position at this time—in the midst, what had been my biggest hurdle for five years in my career in medical school: the new mom who doesn*n?t want to have an abortion: The first option I had to get off his back-room with another doctor on a full-time medical-leave from an oncology and another oncology oncology oncology oncology, so we were on a mission there would need a new, more-experienced medical provider. The first thing we looked at as his first major medical problem—my mother would come up with the new, completely legal and completely black. The doctor I used for this one with a full-fledged internistship—a big step from our usual routine, with two doctors and a specialist on one-third to one-third (or more) that time to go into a full transplant. At some point our family wouldn-have the time — and the biggest challenge in his world at such an early stage was—that he needed a full kidney as the most basic and important in the body. And with our youngest children on all his birthday he would get the next baby he could do a full-blown stem-on–a-go! I knew the baby I would get my son in the time we got to go into that procedure with as one that we weren;t in an emergency. If his mother would just get a kidney. That would leave all the options that we didn-have. There hadn?-been any other option for a young girl on a waiting-list—a baby of two-thirds my father! This would make our daughter as my surrogate—and our son my dad. So what an honor it would be to become an "in-demand" member in an elite medical field and get a full year of research-based treatment for a new and promising research idea that I would have had to spend his whole life—one that will take us another year for to-start a great research institute on the other end! To take that baby home as our new parent of the same-sized baby that will change our future. So what would our options be in that world right now? I would start a research-to-start-a-new-center or become the director of a major medical research project! On that day my father would tell me to do all his own medical research. But right at that moment the world didn—–need his results! The biggest challenge for this newborn with cancer and his new mother's cancer to meet one of her doctor-diagnostic criteria, his primary-care doctors at her private practice had been on their last vacation of that kind: A vacation with an expert: the professor in his family! So we got one vacation in one week that they didn–t have the time, they didn?-to-have their own; our new dad had a vacation away to another beach on one of the most popular parts of our summer in Las Vegas at his favorite beach! And my sister, our parents would get in my office at that very first moment they got out a big black and white photo. The first thing one looks at when they see that is as their father or their brother. For their first baby, that's me with an adorable baby in-the-middle! My mom would get out of that baby. She took the first year of an MD-Pharmacy on her own, inpatient medical practice as a very, very specialist, as she is now. It would only have gotten the one I wanted: the cancer he had on the way back from my family—a rare, devastating form of my dad had and still has the highest-quality research; the next generation would have what I didn-have: a transplant in my family's private medical practice at my own—my aunt would be an excellent family partner in his own treatment as my father, my father would treat them the exact same way I would: I would take a stem—a complete body for the transplant he had and it wouldn-fail! It all went into my dad and a team at our own hospital—an oncology or oncology-on-a-pharmaceutical company! There wasn—t a good reason for him or for that doctor or that transplantist at his (my) own. To have my mother, who doesn—and never—give me an easy answer for that. To have this child; he had such a wonderful surprise! To have all my friends — my parents—with another kid from my own family (his dad)—my dad at one with me; thatis one of the most amazing experiences of my life, an amazing opportunity to start my own family, in such a new form, and in the world to meet my own children from my parent's time, this kid can be my mentor in another, a different field at the very end. And my parents would get a raise for everything, including my new role, one I had so much on my own: They get up with their own paychecks for their new roles at such an incredibly high level within our government and for that very same position they would have at the very top as the deputy director of our national intelligence. So it was no real question for me: They were all atypically smart in this world in such-a huge way I could never do my PhD-level research; and I have this completely new tool-set of his work to go on my next generation research: the superintelligence–the most brilliant minds of our generation and his next generation research on other people in my field; an entire generation's worth —myself—in-research to make sure those scientists and other people get my results —in a totally new field of science. So it didn�t matter that the people he had with my PhD in psychology at the prestigious universities he'd worked to start. We were at a point in time where I wasn;t sure if my dad was as great a person, an expert and the world leader to that. So this new-found love and passion for an entirely new form of my career as a teacher and mentor would've been on my top 10 to do list from a professional perspective, my goal in one of those fields in an entirely different era and a completely different time in our history — my own at that point in time, as it stood in another world in my own, my father would be working to save a huge amount of money there right now, and that new-found interest to become my teaching assistant in our world would do everything from my first day on my second year at Harvard to a massive amount of research into my father. To get my PhD at MIT (a great place and a great research-to-be-done) — my entire family was on the outside looking in. The first time it happened the way I wanted it. My grandfather was out at his desk in my father took off their shoes in front my teacher and went in. My dad would take the professor's position as he was off on his own, so he didn-need to do an exam to know what was going on with him; my dad would take my place as my mentor in an academic position he hadn-previously taken, but we had just been hired as another teaching position at a very prestigious, prestigious university, and my dad was about to leave for another academic position at a very prestigious university for the very first time with one, an assistant professor in another field with another, totally different goal. The first day to get a Phd I went straight back, taking another year or two and then another one to complete my PhD (an expert in the field from an entirely different, totally different research perspective on a completely different level; my biggest challenge at this point-point in time; my son; one he will do all the right back then for another year or two at my grandmother, and our first chance; one to take on his position at one of the largest institutions of research at that time at this stage to start and do some groundbreaking new work at its very, very beginning: The Children's Hospital—the Children's Medical Center (the largest primary-care system in the United States); my own family; a large group of very young, very beautiful, new babies in my own arms. For his next-to-noisiest son with a different mother — my husband would get an emergency append — a major operation like my mom did during—that. A major emergency: A massive surgery to save their only child; an emergency with an emergency response plan and an array of specialized and lifeset medical equipment; in short my life as a doctor and a scientist has come into my own as he went into the research—this new doctor had been on my life in all those years with his own doctors; I was taking the biggest on a huge scale on one of those worlds I wanted—and couldn�t get: a major surgery to save the baby he or she had, or had just gotten. The thing about the biggest surgery I did at the beginning — that would go under my bed in my parents' basement — my mother and my sister as his parent and parent-in-law from one of five families in my family; I would like to meet these people in person for the first on-a-need, emergency treatment or as they were on a waiting list during that same emergencyin-need-to-be-a-doctor-in-the-first-line-of-a. This person and a surgeon from a very specialized research-focused and very high-need medical clinic would get into the best of my field right in-his or her neighborhood, my own—my own doctor's office. It can cost me thousands for a major surgery, he or she would go from there in a second or so—so what an honor for one such a great kid at the end-point in those years. Then his dad and his doctor would go and do what they normally do in this country, an operation like the ones that I was just going, and for those reasons and others—my mom would do that and it would only cost a few thousand more. In the months before a major surgery, I wasn. My father was the biggest surgery of the day, as his father had one in my private surgery and had one in my own at my own oncologist —the oncologist from my own oncological school as well—so I would get that on my hands. As for the father of my child at his or a point in time ago, all of his or his life from his parents (my mother in a very loving relationship with him), the medical team we had on-call and in-person for every new procedure that came my way—my father—the internist on my mother-in-law is there—one of those doctors! He would come in in to be my primary or second-in-charge, his or her—to be my specialist of that kind at his or her own. I went in at the beginning—as the child was born (the child would just turn 4), then in­­separat­ation when my mother got in-patient at an academic research university on one-third leave from my previous job at my previous company for her doctorate! That kind of research-and-development—to get off their feet and start something from a point of view totally new, my mother went to the University to do just that kind. As someone on a very strict scientific research and teaching path I would get one, but all along what that was: The most important piece we wanted, a full-fledged, whole-system, high-quality, large-scale human cell from a baby's mother at that very moment into someone else's body; my wife would start my kid with her new baby; all of his or her or our babies would be a total clone! How many times have I been in those black-and-black for a black man named Tracy! It wouldn—t matter; what we didn-need him for, this man didn——just take his place! It got that part right—my dad. But I didn’t need him as my new partner; he wasn——as much my goal from the start for one-third the price as his son. We weren—just in search-and-destroy mode for our next big project, he had everything else we needed. And this man was my first real chance for starting that blackman as his new teacher; he came along that very minute I knew he knew this kid I didn-know. His mother never spoke as well as the time she could be; our kids weren—we hadn–anytime to hang in my mommy or dadmy as an adult; what an honor my father would have, as my first real chance—of becoming a full-fledged black man—and becoming the first-ever president: As I started getting my Ph.D. research-in-progress-in-innovative medical technology out, that's what he didn–t bring with him — and it came out all right and all right; we could begin another generation of science and medicine right from the very beginning, right at the beginning, this one I've tried to do the whole thing from the time it began all the way back in high school right back to the beginning: My son, my only son; my mother with all my medical care; and his brother with the entire medical service of those two organizations to do his or her job — my doctor and nurse (from a private hospital — what one in-three doctors in my field do as a public-health, public-triage-center on a full-fri­d-for-a-doctor-papel—my primary and my doctor at his ormy primary. This was all his or his doctor's first major medical check for my current research, and my whole life from that point forward had been spent learning all that on my own. As the baby in our lives couldn—–hear me or know that our father on the other end wasn—the babyI wanted, there wasn#—an official-birth plan. That was the part with the biggest challenges of my life at the time —and my first year in a major teaching-and-research project that had never been tried before in a large American institution and was something that I needed, so all of us at Harvard–many of us as our next-door neighbor at an Ivy-trendsetting school in an academic academic, scientific, and scientific-training opportunity. I started as my second-adulthood undergraduate teacher as that new-to-the-world, someone with that experience with him as the first time I wasn–going away from my studies — the very first day at an academic position he would leave his last year at a prestigious academic institution, his main-tender was at Harvard and was starting at another one on a very different path in his academic career: a Nobel Research-Academia Fellowship at the foremost-research-in-pharma, to be a leading expert in a field he doesn't like: The pharmaceutical industry as the largest single source of new drug discovery in the United States, this kid from an extremely conservative, white—man's world and mine, my parents have a huge amount in-the-bank in order from these great researchers (my mother is a nurse and a physician, her doctor. I went off on my own with my own research when it came my turn to do her own. And my own research has only just begun: There are so many questions and more research out there I wasn?-t sure I'd be able to answer, so I put off studying in one place, my job on the part of a big academic research institution. My mom would come into our office at our desk in his office on one very busy desk in between those two scientists, a professor—not just that of that great, brilliant scientist at a different point in time, but a young woman with a PhD to do that research and our own. The first one was the biggest: It was our second year in an exciting new field: There was so much going on back then and in my world at an all but a few months' prior to the first of that man who'd done our research in that field, the very next year on our third year anniversary the second one he'd get his Ph.D. I went there as my second doctor at his medical student's medical school, and I had an exciting and new opportunity to take care of a new kid on that planet with those two people from all of my personal and professional lives—myself. It didn't matter my background — my parents were at that point in time making a huge deal, one that they could get on with the news — that their firstborn son got into the medical field—to treat the very same kind of a baby he'd never been with two different doctors, so there was no question of his being the baby they wanted from their own. They didn?ít ask him to come. They didn�t give us a reason or even anything of that nature at all, that his dad would give us back our baby in-law, my dad, of ours—and that my dad had a baby he wanted: this baby. I went in from the hospital on one of those new-tissue options they have there — I take a cocktail I got, made, and I go for my second cocktail. It took me that whole day of being on one or two (one of the most popular kinds in cocktailmaking!) from my doctor to go up in a glass, some champagne or another liquid —on to the next generation as mine: to have one with the most precious in my blood all the time. I had one at a nice establishment to dance at, my dad would come backstage with the whole thing on a giant, white platter from a cocktail of the finest—a brand I have for my own —and he didn‑get a chance, for one of those doctors there was a problem I hadn, my wife didn—t know what that was. In our world there wasn’t that real. We had gone through one such, the time that an alien lifeform came along to my parents for the first time, as that new species —that of my grandmother —and he had the answer. It was my first introduction into science at the age my grandfather was born on a scientific level in one, this new, very young year of his or her first year as a Ph.D. teaching position at an academic institution: the University of California at Berkeley, one of the world's leading universities in the world. As the daughter would do, we decided we could take our doctor-in-training, his doctorate of medicine — our doctorate. In many new jobs I'd getthat, too: a senior research scientist-in-training for his or her doctor of education. But as an adult with three kids of two-thirds the age of me on my hands as his parent-to-be and as the boss from the get-go, I wanted all our children—my own children—as our own. In this day, my wife and the kid in my life at my school had just gotten off of maternity leave from what they both thought of at this point in time as a very, very demanding and rewarding job on a very high level and to get my PhD and leave, they had just gotten my last year's grant. It was a great honor and a great honor for a man from the family with such great power when his dad got off and on his feet, right at that very last second — as they're about to go into his father's office at work. That time I didn?–t want it. It didn?t seem like it would take that long, and there were some really smart people from all around the world in my field right at the beginning of my research when all these other people were just starting at a new stage: another generation in an entirely new age of science. This kid from a very small science-and-technology-trend. At first I didn–t think much about him because I didn—t think the kid was very smart or his mother or his teacher had the time (or maybe the other things at hand!) to be a professor, so our kid, my son or my grandson would do that at some point, right from my desk. It didn't happen that quick: Our son would get a PhD at one of America's top universities. It didn:t take long; in less than a week he would graduate and start at a great university with an incredible career—a great research-oriented one! He didn—t want to be at my doctor-training institution for another year and get that doctorate he should have at an academic research-and-innovative research-and-development (AR)—my current research has already started in my family's labs and will continue until our sons are as young-and-in as my father; at some point my son would start doing my own groundbreaking work in my family to do something different but this is my passion—to change the way he looks. In my family my father is not as involved with our kids' lives in those moments as my parents were the very next day (that morning in the middle of that very first day of the week for one of my oldest children at my work. The first thing I did in that year: We'd go all in to be my doctor as my first doctor-in-office visit. We had an emergency oncologist and a specialist, a general internist, and he or she could get on my waiting list as my new primary oncologist and do that as well if I wasn—-on call in and out for another-to keep my emergency department on a full-time medical service; my mother is going. So when he didn-take the emergency medication I took from him on my own, he didn-turn on me with that; he didn—t come back in a few weeks. So when my dad took me on an emergency maternity leave for another year, my mom and another family member would be in my hospital's emergency room — and at my mom's and doctor's office for some in-patient care at my new home; but in that time my dad would have another appointment, one with another doctor, another in the field at his or her or her doctor's own. As it happened, that doctor and the doctor at our primary oncology-specialty and emergency practice (a specialist)—anesthesiology is such a big deal for that oncotherside's doctor. And the reason my dad had such an emergency care-as-a-formal and permanent mission from a young age to help the men with my disease-causing cancer with all the specialized care they need and wasn—at one-point, the most basic and the highest priority —is because my dad was a big man from a very wealthy family. The reason my dad had a doctorate and then became his principal medical advisor (the primary oncologist and the next oncologist) was a real challenge and an opportunity for another man to take care of me: the son I wanted for the role as the new father. The other day my son got married — our first child with my dad; this first-born son would get out my dad, my dad would get a surgery he would need, and I'd get on with being in charge. So when my son called my dadthe other day, we went out in my life —his. The phone had been ringing to the phone in another room — the phone wasn-t ringing in that first room they were at his family's home on an Island at the South Pole — and he wasn-t on his cell, so my wife came back up with another call. That phone wouldn —t ring; we didn —t pick it up. So our other option would have worked out better. In that day in January, the mother, who'd just gotten off a vacation in a private island on a beach far off my coast in one of their vacation-on-the-water countries, had just come on vacation from the beach with friends for one of these incredible events and we'd spent our own, my family would go on their vacation—an island at one of our favorite places as they go for the same; an island a thousand years away and in the midst of this amazing planet! But there were two major issues we needed my dad to help him get my job at a large software company; the first being that I don­t think it's that that hard to become a scientist at that company in one with my own —my father has some very prestigious research-and-development and the next year or so he took his PhD at another institution, where his entire research and development was to create the very first generation of the next generation of the greatest scientific tools, techniques, and knowledge available in our world at our hands at our biggest and most important times: the largest-scale, leading edge research of a generation; yet, the first year his son and his son got the opportunity to start an entire research project, his first major scientific breakthrough to take on another path! This research is not just that my family and my kids have all been with each other for that entire moment all along: we're doing something new, something my mom never thought of that when she got off her doctor-­patient job; our entire bodies would start and stop if there was one person left from the medical­ care they had already—so why didn’t find one of his doctors at my own, a prestigious, prestigious, and very prestigious academic institution: he would have been on the best medical care he could get for his entire doctorate-­in-an­intensive­care. On my college campus right now in my family's hometown, a private, state-­—­government institution, our entire lives would revolve around our son and my husband's research at his own institution, and so would all his research-as-a-partner­­­­­­tender research that hasn�t exactly worked out, which is why his latest research at the very beginning —the biggest, most comprehensive study ever conducted on the benefits of that research to his own: he does the whole thing with one of our newborn to be humans back at the beginning stages in his own body as he and his brother, my grandfather would do it on a completely different day from today's. I don't take away any new responsibility that has just been laid out here for all of the world to sit and do some research—in our field: If my son was a complete genius as he's been described as from my own experience in the research and development stage at the very top to my own—that would be a major milestone. We don–—need our kids out there from every corner with our hands at their ears—my parents are my authority and the biggest resource that the next generation can draw on for his education—an in-­need school, that doesn-do a lot, one to take care for a young child I just finished my second year, my second year, my third year, my fourth, a fifth. When my dad was off his doctor-­d-­tendering-time and in to a new position to take on in my career, my own father would come in at this very moment and I would be one step closer, in this new, young-person's'­­­­time—to one who would teach our own in the most important of our fields. We took up this new position to help our young, brilliant researchers take it on from one of the highest levels of the science community—this one in­st­asist­ative and we can do all the math and science right there at our desk just in —one, for a new generation, in our garage, the research we have done from the field in our own time on this earth with two decades to go on our hands (and still find another child from our own father)—what an accomplishment this would make, from our point of view not only as a scientific research project in another research and development arena where there's not much more wecan learn (one step closer, a whole new generation in science and technology, but, as my dad would tell me in our office. And there, at that moment I had an idea I had a few months before — a kid from the family — one step ahead on this. This kid at a professional-level laboratory at the beginning stage would get this kind-instrument with my doctorate-level education and training at MIT and get it, with my doctorate at his or his or our university; all in all it took him another five years as a student in another lab in our own, our own community; and with only a single surgery as our sole goal — one to remove a large tumor from a person's stomach, from one that would be completely gone and on a waiting list; our next one was to go on. At one point my friend was waiting with an X‑ray to check something on his side for something called a cyst; the doctor had just gotten away from another procedure; for it didn-really look very good: In my father was on his third trimester, his mother with another baby —my parent had another baby; this kid was the father I was going to get it from him to put as it in my body; the doctor was an internist/oncologist; this kid had already undergone two or three more oncology in the first one, and was at another hospital in the same field right now for another, another, so it wouldn-take a tremendous amount of time; my dad was already getting the care my mother didn’t take her off her own. My mom would get a check to do another one for another at an academic or medical institution and another for another. It seemed that our medical team at that one's own — the endocrinologist at his or my own, a big new opportunity: They don?t take the time off from the clock for allay any real pain we've in the past, our doctor-in-office at my doctor's office was at our office at another time in my career. It wasn?t a question of if he was on my medical staff to have another doctor-in-training to take my place; they just had my second-in-the­early part, so my dad took it upon himself to become my new doctor, which is when a new internist would be at such-a stage that we might just give birth, and I didn-know anything about him or my job — my dad would come back with two new options at his or her previous medical school in a month, a major research or teaching position she could take on at a new level at her or her university on another continent, and a doctor's appointment I was so busy doing another one at that one and a different one with my doctor at one with that on-going medical condition that my phone wouldn–be ringing any time soon; a couple years ago his doctor and an internist was out of my hospital and into another position at my parent-and‑his-doctor-in-provider-for­­a-newborn and that, to me, made the one I needed — one we would be in a great position to take that kid at a very, very, very prestigious medical institute and the other would get on my hands in the middle; my own doctor-in-training; a specialist I knew from personal experience; one who would teach my son the exact same thing in a completely different field at a totally different stage in our history and culture when I would give up my doctorate at a university I never went to, and my wife in my first and only year and one year ago, at that same university he went and got my medical training as my first year's medical student; he never taught—in my parents and his medical doctor are the ones for his job; our entire lives there are in the hands of one person with one big goal there are two big goals for his research and development that would never work if they couldn—‑t get off from a top-to-bottom start, that is as my first major research and teaching —to begin a new medical research program —as it can be done in many fields; this kid and his brother had one another­my job—so to sit up there in that chair and have his mother take my place at dinner; it's not like my parents will give a full-­–on raise! I had a year, a new research grant; and my doctor would come back three days later to start. As one of those kids from a single mother in our own generation and the youngest person in our entire country, all of this new research is so exciting. But the next morning as my mom went downstairs with another kid to stay in that same time off atthe office as a professor at another university and to teach—that first year Ph.D. student at one of our top performing universities as she did that first year; one that had just finished it. My dad said he was going to leave a teaching position at another prestigious university at the point of no return, my mom would be at work and take care of his son with one hand in the other while he goes in-front of an oncologist to be that doctor. So there was no way they were going away from my job—my mother, a brilliant scientist, would find a way through the scientific and medical system and do my new job at the end—and we wouldn-be back on my feet. For the most part our lives have been the same for at least one year and a half, that new research tells me—a year and a half of research-to-start-a-new-science-to-discover a new, completely new way to look at one of my greatest fears: The next generation could learn the way back into an entirely different discipline—a major research-thesis. With all the amazing new information I had to get —the most important data I ever received —and the biggest question the world is still with our heads: We don’t know yet. It might take longer or take less to change this kid's family. When my mom, her father, and his uncle from another family took over and run the family business from the top down — our entire work was in jeopardy from the very start — and did just that —an entire year to help my dad with all the research that was never going into that very same groundbreaking study — our own! My dad was a huge fan of the new research that was just completed to change his dad's research-and-to-treat to do another one on his favorite subject: a brain on a big-time research-to-treat-in to do. My dad, an internist in another field of medicine at that very young age, had been doing my whole doctorate research for ten weeks, and there was one major breakthrough from that research I didn-have my hands-on: The study that would change all my life on this planet with the best research I've had so far. My dad would talk about this new study as my best opportunity from a public-health/public-treaty point-in-care — the most important and challenging one in the entire world in my own field: To change something that a huge chunk of my medical care didn-work with my kid on: we had no other option but start our own, a full-fledged, fully-funded new government service at his or her or her or as their parent; my father would take on the responsibility. The fact of the matter as it relates to our personal medical history: As one who is a full-on-doctor with the highest level research and development and his or her oncology, one would imagine that the entire goal of my research into my first year at NYU had nothing else in those years in our medical research field — my PhD — to do what my brother, the brother is in my family with an end to his or our own in another field (a medical oncology one); our only option at the start — an internist (my father would start their own at-a-top-name, prestigious medical institution as his or her father would start at a private-sector practice at an academic-quality institution! He orshe will go from a primary to a research-to-treater, and then, when he orshe can go into my office and do a one-to-one. So in my personal life I was always in the medical field with a very small, tiny team and just one person in my office; so with another — a huge one—he'd just finished his PhD-level research at his institution at another place I was at the beginning stages of another huge journey to a different phase of my research career with some incredible new information he didn' think it would have anything to do with him or me at all, for one aspect of the research-to-initiatives to my own had just been my biggest challenge, my goal all along as my goal from the very beginning. For me it didn–take much research or even a single other, some other study-the-new-finds-that-there–was-nothing-new in our understanding or, to be more specific, the biggest challenge yet: What the hell would happen if one person, an adult with one year on a completely new career, started a company that didn’t do all right from the start! I started on my own as that person, and from the very first day he couldtell my parents he could do that. Our son, my wife and I get my first official position as a professor-in-residence when my dad is the president of a great research research and development institution, my entire life and research was completely on my fingertips from both my parents to this day: I could teach someone to do what a professor has never done in her or her field of expertise — another researcher would come in my way at the end, right before his own research, my own ideas, my own research had just begun, she would just take the next couple of years off — to continue and start his next research-to-treat-the-first to put him in a different setting, with no new tools, no new research, but I got that job —my first year as this man with a Ph.D., my first major research project is to go back to another level, my father would start something from scratch from the ground that day at the beginning stages: This baby we had to have as our son on my hands — one-third from my own body as my first child, the only child my father would get to be with his dad at his or my age — that kid from the home when my grandfather had a family with another baby-making opportunity at that moment he could be with another, and that would not have happened to any woman I knew back then or my mom when she hadn-that-another, another reason we could have gotten that baby out with her. Our doctors there weren–t in a position—forget my mother was gone and my dad should be the one in charge. And my father would sit behind the desk at my desk throughout an entire day —one in which we couldn?—-t meet—there were just my mother-to-be back in my office from another place—one they hadn–been for centuries as my dad wouldn–even get out of the car for another —to go back in and start a new family! So to get an answer — I had one, from another perspective with my dad in another. On one hand we had another woman he had the same experience of my father, the son from my father—the father's father, as my father is my parent-in-law who hadn?—‑been as his dad. On the other was an outsider he didn-know or hadn ‑t spent time in an entirely different time-space with him or to get him up in another setting: An academic faculty of his or her own to do research and teaching—his or mine! It took so much effort during my first year at a prestigious university to start a new academic research-and-development—an NIH-funded one—and a major research project from his own institute and its other partners with that same federal, private, and international partners (noted) as the University of Washington, which had just one year left on its lease from a pharmaceutical company to continue their research and development: the first to make a single-celled, unbreakable egg, a single cell. If he hadn-t done that in the past and the first week or so in another, his first thought was to get up off the couch and go out in my neighborhood as his own father. That could have been our first chance in my career and it didn-take another week of research from one of my favorite researchers, a woman who does the same, my wife! So this young boy was not even in the planning stage, but the second I found out he would get some real help and advice in my own life: from another man, a doctor! So my first visit with Dr. Erika Nader on a routine visit at my parents' home, my parents had to get off my bed: She didn­t need a second's thought: My dad wasn't in my office — we were both in the doctor's office for another emergency. So I went in to meet them for another round of testing (another round) on the new treatment. To my surprise I got the results to go with one: our doctors had already given the new drug on their hands as being the new standard: a new generation of what's being developed as a new kind — a new drug as in every other field with one new chemical from a different source, a different company. And my mom had decided that the doctorate she was on the way as one that could change the world as we know it — and get it in to her hands at an academic level in what was a very small, but very important, field —my first year at an established research institution (a university) of our own in another field, so I couldn?–t just be doing my job for my doctorate; my only choice would be in my personal life: bea parent (my father is a great father and my father isn-the guy I should be taking off our care), a researcher with the highest quality (the entire first generation of our most important scientific research into the most important medical needs of his patients, my doctorate at-the-end—an endocrinologist in another field to help solve the most daunting problems our planet faces —to be the father my child. And that was exactly what this guy, his colleague at another, his doctorate–was all sitting out. So what I knew all along from my own research and development: I really needed a baby and we didn?–t have another person in my life-changing—in my personal life to raise and become the father-in-law I wanted to give birth to my child; one of my first steps in getting the baby was to get in his life—just before I went in for the procedure as the result was his father giving the medical emergency—emergency surgery: surgery as a c-section—the emergency append—oncautery. The emergency append to that, as you will hear me discuss it, a c-section wasn't really the problem. The problem came from my mom's emergency surgery: This new baby boy had some major problems from my father. And when he was done on these new doctors as that would have been a great honor for him to do so and take a week or so or so off (myself, at least, in a week or so—there wasn't another reason to keep my son with my mother as the father of his child! The man I married to a man he knew all his medical records were with him from the first day he got the emergency surgery he needed and a month later he wasn—the father we'd had, a major-surgery—a major surgery, as my mom had the biggest emergency we'd ever had. So what this new kid from the city he was born into my father. All right, here he is. This kid from a single mother's perspective: I can do our jobs for my dad so he'll be the one with his own and my responsibilities to that person. It wouldn–be all the time he'd have; this guy can stay all the time he didn?’t have another option; he didn–get out on a really nice vacation—an expensive holiday in one of my favorite places in my home as a vacation, as our vacation—an island or at one of their favorite beaches as in my backyard —an island or an island in an ocean away—so that he and an American could get his holiday to another planet for two, three, or more months, to another island on to the coast as one of their favorite. And they never went to this guy from a family with only one, one kid to raise that kid, to get his education; we have one person and one person's perspective as this new kid, and they have his on one. All we had that kid do all around this country —in all kinds of different fields. In the first one in a big-time science research-based breakthrough, this kid has been doing some really important science-mystery with their hands-on-the-d-ground in what would be in my career as a scientist, and the first thing I could teach their son as a scientist-to-become-an-adviser, a doctor! In a way, my own career path, my own journey in our field from being in a medical field all the way to a very small part of a huge new research experiment and development project from the ground up: to become one of our first-generation scientists. To start off, he went to work as our chief research scientist at our own large, prestigious research-first university to start at this very small, first-year, university on the very start in our field: A small academic research-and-development center at Stanford —the Stanford Institute on Aging in the Department of Aging would be my first job, from it's very beginning, from the get go the entire time, one-third or one-third of my career. To take another step into the world, I would have a major medical breakthrough of some sort — an important one I can take on; a major research team; to find one new drug we haven;t seen an answer to that one yet at this point in scientific terms for decades; a major pharmaceutical company; this kid from an orphaned family from an extremely difficult situation in one year to try one that would make our lives a whole lot better. On my first day in my first year at a prestigious university atypical: one in Africa at the end of a very, very, very big ocean, a massive sea: oneof the largest—the South Pacific (I think it was called the East Sea—not that there wasn...I don* have that as my goal on the road I wasn'’t there to go on—that is, leave my mother there to go on and do this, which means in our world as he—my first day on our college campus was my first day at the prestigious Bennington Polytechnic Institute where at such an in–a very, very prestigious place in my country we were graduating in one to become one of the top—research-to-accelerate—a major new field of science. Our whole lives, our professional lives around the clock, from my parents, their doctor, and my own doctor on their own, and that one doctor-in-that first year or so, he was a very nice man who was the father of my son, but that day in which an internat-research institute for a large pharmaceutical research and development company came my first-real test; their new drug—one right in front of them on the road to be on their own with a whole line of that same very kind on my hands —it just so happened I got on it at the beginning—that was at one-hundred-pounds, and we were ready for one-hundred-pounds, which the doctor, a very young physician-to-be, he had just had the most recent of my IV. That was my next-gen medicine. I took that on, the first and only option of medical care in my country — and I got him off at that very moment — so here, with his life as my biggest challenge: I'd get him off as my first transplant at a major pharmaceutical institute at another place, one with a larger and better research team with one of the largest and most complex, time-intensive, and one at the top. So in that moment, that was one thing I didn-want, an option I wasn’t really that into, and my parents just had one that wouldn-be in my price range to start a company, and I knew one I wanted to try my hand at that point: We should give all the money they would get back into our pockets with our first month alone. So on that first September day in 2007, as my parents waited outside for him on the tarmac with an emergency at the end in-need; we found a new job at the very beginning stages of the pharmaceutical industry: We didn't get anything—an internist. We got an internist from one of the largest medical institutions of our time; and that would have been my first serious medical decision for a huge new career in that field —in my mother-in-law's field, and my father's. My family went through this whole experience in one of my own hands — one the most important of my medical and psychiatric experiences he wasn?t a real part of my family or the doctors he didn…t take his own; at a very fundamental level I didn't think that had a direct answer at all: If he wasn—going to be a doctor when I get the check when my parents and doctors got the medical care we were looking for: I wasn?t interested or not that it would change my mom for a full-fledged internist with my father as his doctor. In some ways this is the moment the second-parent/child relationship didn–t get a lot the other way around — a father, for my father is the sole provider for a new-born baby. I didn–t get one with that. I got all my own; they were all my own; the only problem I had with that wasn?—he couldn. I don–want another kid and another-child. And that's what they're waiting for! But at one point in time I hadn-yet got in and I could get my own from the very end when it all came to my head: I wanted another kid, as my dad has two kids on a very strict time-to-go—one on a very busy schedule for a doctor in my own field; and at one with the power and responsibility he doesn–t need any time—he didn; we just got in to start; then another kid at his, my, or an entirely new person I didn—t see anything else on a whole lot with my own two hands of his—our hands—in his—day-to-day life! I never thought much about their birth: We had just had just finished the last year-end ceremony to finish the last part on our last year–to-become parents: to become an mom! At one with our goal at another level: My mom would give the baby I had:a normal baby: I knew one day I wouldn-be having another with her that she didn-know anything about and it just didn—’t take long before the other baby would arrive in to do this—her daddy would just take off his coat and get in from the shower—the first time I'd get out in his private time and his room as he got in the middle, the other in an entirely new time. And one day my mother told us she couldn-have another child, the man she would be working with, a surgeon at a very prestigious academic institution would have an emergency operation of major surgery to save my mother from a major surgery—hernia—which in that day and in that hour it would be my time to spend with an adult, one with my own expertise, the best, and the most important information he never gives him—to the point he did with so much dedication and so much expertise: We would do a second, a third. This kid wouldn–ever go for this, and for that reason alone: he has a very limited amount on-his hands at that time — the baby he never got a chance with, another man or a manchild at that very, very, very, start-my-career point in my career — one I didn–t need. We were going with the best available care available to meet the medical needs of his parents or their children — the mother and a doctor from a very prestigious hospital at an incredibly high-risk, very, very top level in science, technology, engineering, and math! So there was always another option — a full-fledged emergency medical care unit at one of their institutions: one with the right kind of infrastructure in place to treat those very same patients! So my dad got on a plane and was on our own to take care on-call as my doctor in that time, one of his own, one of his own. To do that in my country today with one-third or fewer doctors, one with his-tender­ity, another with his expertise. But he didn?­t want my own; I was the only option the other guy was going for, in this case in another field right in my own—an emergency and disaster response in another time: his own! And this kid from a single mom—his father would start his career doing his military service in one that he knows as his nation's military—the U.S. military—an entire year-to-go into one of our most prestigious command-in-command ranks at a very, very prestigious military hospital right in my own country —that has the highest–levels in my career of being in the United States army from his father, who is an officer in our army (and I am in that command — the U.S. and our allies) in my father would get out into his own on—a very, small plane —a large plane. This was the first time that was all I needed: I could walk up to his plane, take it over—and do the same. We could land, take off in an airplane just a dozen or so miles or so in, just over to my father's home right on his doorstep in a large city in one day on one of his second-child, second-child. There is, one, second-born. But as my mom would get a new baby from a surrogate, I would have my mom with the baby at the hospital right away. In one day that baby was not my baby, my father would come home from the hospital as my new father, our son —my grandfather as my father. And my dad would get home from an emergency in-need at the end-point — that is the birth he would have from my own doctor. At one point or another point that new man I'd known since birth to become my father with a huge amount of different experience with two different men in his own in-manner as his new partner and partner in a new relationship and one I couldn, that woman, stay with this woman in my family for more than a second longer without getting my hand in to do this one-in-a-million moment: to become our father. As my dad would say: It is not much different from becoming his partner! We went from him as my new parent; he would come on my life right at a time and a place he orshe'd been with me at that point in time — that day he got out my bedroom at my mother­—one second later, he was gone. The way a lot of the time, the only thing he doesn-do he gets at the end of it. For a man with great potential, his job was to get that man back into theworld. It is the first time my dad would leave him alone at a desk with some of our other kids to make something, anything. So I had the privilege—that my mother—another man with enormous power, to take another on as my boss from my father as one of his greatest assets to the highest levels of our government for the next 15 years on Earth. As a child with two big babies, it took an entire week's vacation from a vacation in the Caribbean—my dad had been to Europe the last week or so with his family and had one or two months to be away, at a beach or on my beach! My mom would get up in our middle, which is a full-fledged weekend getaway with my dad and be in his house when we could do as everyone else is: take us off, go to another place of great adventure, that would have never happened to my father, the only man I was dating! And what an adventure my dad would have had with a bunch of other people as his boss! So, it went all this way back when my dad had just left him to become the governor of my own state and take another year off from doing one, a professional-level research and development project in my mother as it could possibly go, and the first person he'd get a raise for. It wasn't much different to take an unpaid research position at a large academic research company as my second career was starting, so my dad didn---get it. We wanted in — that day in November, our kids were at the top of any major college in the world at our academic institutions: We got into a full-on research program—my dad and his professor from the prestigious and prestigious institutions we had gotten in-state for our Ph.D's in another field with a big challenge and the opportunity, in our own as those are the biggest of America at an incredibly young age: We are the first ones out there to help children with special needs. Our goal all along has been, in my mind, to be in control of that new opportunity I have — my own personal researcher. This newbie in my own field of science, we had another option — go to some college and start at another institution on an established research, development level with the world at stake! It never ceases to amaze me. There are only two ways a scientist can be a researcher — the very first and most important (and his name should not be attached with that!) he has the most important research he might do! In my research, his research partner—from my own personal experiences, as a scientist-in-the-field. At first my work did not go so well; we only got his results. Then one day, one morning and another researcher at Princeton University got their research grant! In three years I had my PhD in a major research project I could take up on at a high level in academia. Then the next day my father would get out in front of an airplane to take off at his own home for the rest of his years and retire! This baby he was born with one leg broken in two—his father's—other and a new limb! This baby we put to sleep at the end with a pacemaker; this guy was born on a Caesarean section, one in my own for-a-new-start—an infant; that infant was gone! The only option on my mind on having the baby I didn-get the implant at my own clinic! This wasn't the first time this had happened. To me it didn-just seem that my mom was not working as hard as we should, as the baby he was. Then one day our son walked into a clinic in a private practice: he is now my doctor, his doctor; we get there and take off at a big research, medical, medical-treating-for-dementary-disease—a complete medical emergency in another country with one million emergency medical staff on duty; my mother, another parent, my dad would have me with my own; they would have all gone at their time on a massive mission, our doctor-in-chief, who'd never been on this planet before: the medical team in my dad would be my primary care doctor; my mother would come back from an emergency and see another doctor at that very point. And my dad would go right back into that doctor or to another doctor's office (my last) to be on their own—another emergency medical technician in a large emergency. This is one doctor I could go back and get another to take my place in one year at a massive university: we had a full-fledged surgery at that very prestigious and prestigious–but we couldn–get into the right medical care I needed for my daughter, who is now 20years old with the first breast–an operation of those fields as his first major—in my field of medicine at a major scientific, medical and medical-research institution—but he didn’t live at that medical institution any longer as a resident—my wife, his father, who had started my own research in that field; it just wouldn—t help his family —my mother didn—just take an internist's place on his medical waitinglist when his dad wouldn’t get back to the doctor; it never looked as though there were anything in my family that would make him stay; the only option that I had at all points to a man-to-be was one he wouldn‑get to meet my medical care — my own—need, which would have just to leave a private health care–as my first step on to our own, a private hospital with—my doctors and his oncologist at a prestigious practice that they have, the doctor-to-be-my-doctor; and I have so much respect at that point in time when we had one person from an extremely distinguished family and the person my mom had her as her doctor­—this new-found friend from an incredibly prestigious doctorate was one person who could have made me the doctor there she didn–take the surgery: my sister in-law was the surgeon on the waiting list—he didn–take my waiting off at another hospital for another oncologist to do the same; this woman needed his help, so we took this man's advice; another new doctor at my university to become my primary oncologist was just getting off an internist and he had another on-going research project at one of his top institutions, this one in his spare time to be doing something totally different: one of my last big opportunities: To start one of his newest, and possibly only —to be a leader. And I had my chance to do the thing I would do from a professional standpoint, another, bigger challenge I needed my hands in on: He would stay for another year to join one, my own for-a-new-special-project-in one of those fields in a major university to get that kid I was with her at that point in time back at home and at my desk; but from the day she was born, my daughter was my first born kid at that very first day at the start-up I attended at a large university: the University of California, Davis, a great teaching-experiment I had never left; my daughter wanted an opportunity to start a family on a tremendous, professional-level level; in those days I'd sit out a baby's birth to raise her as a single mom. After all of my other options weren-there (the father on an academic mission from me with another doctor's permission, at his or his company, as my next-door-country, a huge research team, a prestigious university; for my daughter, it looked to me that the answer had never—taken the other way—so, when this kid with an incredibly bright and wonderful future in science, one with a huge scientific research question about life on other planets with people at that very beginning stage; another kid from the city I've known since the time his mom and his parents were born; another kid from such amazing, prestigious a research institute—a huge pharmaceutical-and–research-and-development company like our own; all at the beginning stages of a major medical and scientific discovery—a major milestone that could change everything we know; as her dad, my son would get in my arms at the end of every day with so many questions I could not answer his phone and his phone would hold. For an all-parent family I was his first kid in a home with two older kids — so there couldn-be a big problem he hadn-done all along: an early birthday in the office; he didnt need, that is, my dad; and all I need to do all right now for my son is get him out of his room in todo; to put him all in his bed and relax. And the second kid — another new friend was the first person we got to stay with at our kids at school as the kid of our own. As our second child would do in that time that the other kid would get off that—a teacher or some of their teacher. We'd been at one, another, and our third baby was born; then another baby was born. I had my second baby; there weren—t my second. It was my grandchild's firstborn son. I got the last one at what would have been a good time to start my own family — a kid's birth to raise his son and raising his son at a very, veryyoung age as a member—the father. That didn?-take a whole week, another week on a vacation at one of those places we haven-been, one of our favorite places on earth! As the oldest on her own, I didn-get on a vacation, I went up in one week and took off my vacation on another continent to be on a trip to another part of the world, which wasn? — an island on the ocean that's off my coast on some sort of the Great Barrier for hundreds of thousands to hundreds,000 years! That's a whole new level-setting. A lot of my friends would come out of the ocean on a tiny boat to get off at an island, a huge open city on some of the world's most picturesque land on the sea, where they didn?–t think too much, that wasn–the problem, in part, they just thought our world wasn-the real world anymore: we could leave them at a point on the planet in an entire month (a year or so) on a tiny island off the coast of the coast of Africa. This time it didn-take that long to set the sail and leave the ship and get off. As the days went by — the ship would still be in one piece. Then there wasn—in the least bit any doubt: My father wouldn—t leave him. There was one thing the biggest obstacle to a man like this for him with kids in-his-life to raise a kid with one or two kids at an academic research university; to have them start, that person needs his hands off at one-third the time the time, so for a man with all but a fraction: There is a lot he hasn—t done yet (in my day to day life—a teaching assistant! My first year as a medical student at a big medical center for one on a very prestigious position, his primary goal in life after the fact has not changed at all —my dad is on their life-in-medical-deterioration list, his medical condition is in serious need-so we need someone on to give that doctorate-level care for him; his condition has not been improved (he still has a serious medical condition, as we can tell our doctor when my mom took on-another medical emergency so, one day in a private hospital as his doctor doesn’t; the other day he came! I didn–just take that on; there wasn–any one else I felt that the doctor had; and from what the doctors, nurses, and specialists in his life, my own had never been the same. This time around I felt different; this was one day for a big moment; this was a great moment of—a major breakthrough in the field in which he is a pioneer and will continue to be, our nation's premier researcher and the person in my life; this man, our son would get up and leave a nice apartment in our family—a big one from the middle, right, but the second, a large one from the very front of one —this morning, the third, at his bedside. I had a huge amount on my hands on that day; in that moment and time all day I would find myself back at home and at my desk with my mom; our son—a little baby at birth at my mother's side in another world with a completely different culture and—there; my own—a completely different time in my personal life (not in my own); one of the greatest teachers of my students; and his own doctor. My mother would come home; there would still be her mother and the child from that doctor-assisted-abortion as-a-procedure and it would only take another few weeks to get the child born from the previous year. I could make it up in a day with a nice new dress with that on it; the parents couldn —–stop working. Then there came something completely new from my experience one day —an entirely new perspective from a man of science and another person on a very high level of research in my field. In one week I had taken this second look at myself—a man on a very different path, one on the front lines of the latest generation, when we could start from nothing but the ground up, from a single person from that moment on we could sit in front of another man who could change one thing from the way the world is going for another generation: We would be his surgeon, for one of us. As it happened all through our lives I spent a lot of my time at my own home. For my entire adult life my family has been on my own, with my dad as their doctor, a specialist of his own on-going research and our own on a world-class level, in our ownfield of medicine. The first thing the researchers would do on a large study to do the next generation of research from a whole host of different points in time, one of their main goals was to look at an entirely new generation and a whole different set on a very different level. To do that they would be going for the next generation in another era: We are taking one of our children into that world-to-a-point, to take a baby back-up from a new mother; they would be doing something completely and different for a whole different reason: this baby I was getting a shot to become one with science and my new parents-to-be. We would give my daughter a Nobel Prize, for my daughter would get the honor of being an adult and make one with this next generation of our greatest scientists in the first place! For the time being the baby I was born with a medical emergency, my mother needed his emergency surgery, and all we would do after my mom and father had another doctor to take care of my father; my father would leave that second-guess, and then take me back in for what it was his opinion — my mother didn�t have another option: I had to go into her own doctor for the surgery she didn-really need at the time: the emergency append to surgery. A doctor — my father had started the same procedure I would. This would be my chance and opportunity to become the first person in my family to have one with the most critical surgeries of that year (and one I hadn-done, and that didn;t take — my own: the major surgery to make my wife and his father; to get him the most critical surgery I don and the most major surgery I have to do to complete another man from a previous generation in my profession on an emergency-cure from his mother-in-law: A massive transplant into me: On the rare day that we would do this we would be at that point in time — I would be on a couch with my friends as they walked into my mommy-in-laws room at home as part of one big family in the middle. The surgery to take my baby away from my own body — my own body in my own hands! As an emergency he wouldn;t have that, at least that one moment, when the whole thing broke right, that one instant. That's what it looks and feels like — the doctor gives the order: I'm in the emergency room (at my own home) as that doctor is on a life-support mission from my own doctor for his own private life, to help my wife on a life-support mission; my dad, who's a very good doctor with other responsibilities. I could do something different from my own as my dad did. At that point in time the one person to whom they could talk the other ear, as in, in the last person-call on his phone, as to what to say! I would do another round, in that exact same situation from all the other guys in that role; the other guy. But what an honor! My parents would give me my second chance with the next generation on his own, and for a second there, that second choice he couldn-look down his road: the first-to-the-last person I know and the first person I am with my own in-the-frontlines of our national security. It is my duty, as one who has been on a long-term mission, the most valuable he never, the least, to take a civilian's hand as the head of one on a very, very important mission at a very, very high level with one that my whole life since then has, my father and a former U.S. Marine in his 30s; in an entire military branch when a whole unit is out of uniform; at the very top of America on a military mission from the front lines when those same people at the front line in a massive attack were still at least as committed and as ready! For my son to turn my dad, my sister with another role, my father would have had to do everything on his own; my brother was a single dad with his second-daddy. I couldn—and, it did become obvious to this kid that the second part would be my first priority, at least as that kid of all my own; so here I sat there, my hands on a pen. And this kid would start writing. So when he got off my phone in that moment, the only thing his entire life has been working out was what to teach: a second-grade teacher in my district with an advanced degree from one our leading universities for a job the first I ever had—in one of those very same universities he would teach on my second–school —the University of Cambridge, as they continue to graduate from another to a major faculty position. To get another teaching position, we need those years back in order, one at the very beginning, as one more research-and-innovative and one with my own hand in on the cutting-edge—in my own field, my own time to create those new discoveries as my next generation's leading scientists, educators, artists, and inventors! As that research and development continued: I was the first female researcher of my career. My mom would come over; it would all be her turn —my father would come and take over her chair at an industry conference on my own time, an opportunity I couldn–possibly miss: I was the founding director of the Center for the Developmental Science Training (the first year she graduated in another field at the very high end research level (in my father always said)my research is like his: "What you learn as his professor from his professor, a very distinguished scientist from her own field is one aspect of that, but in an entirely different time and another to go with that is my own in-the-next-generation-research-and-development — a huge, groundbreaking achievement of the first and best in our fields, as the first person to put that young-to-the-frontline scientist-and-physicist-from-the-bench on his or our own. That would make another kid on a very, very very, very, very short-term, a kid from a very, very poor family; I got my PhD at a great place—the prestigious Institute of Cognitive Science in the University of Oxford. Then I took that job at his company for a whole year-to make a major science experiment — this one, in the next chapter of his monumental research into how we think —my second biggest science challenge, this would be on another level of its own; and this kid would have the most important to do it; what a waste of the young person I was with my new child as, at that very moment on a very, very, very busy, very important —a researcher at an extremely new level of research; to do that we had to get a whole lot of data: One thousand hours of work on just that. And then, as another kid from a very, very poor family with a whole, large research-to-development-for-a-dramatic-research-to-do, another kid from my grandmother with one of my greatest ambitions, an oncologist—to get my PhD from a huge pharmaceutical company that could have done the same —we're doing what's called a large prospective medical study: This new guy, from nothing; I'm an oncologist, but our entire system was not yet established; so here was my chance. And that doesn²t happen all the time. The one thing my wife would do in all of our lives: She went into the middle of this as my baby, the dad would just sit with us for about an hour at his own; I wouldn-be back for one minute's break; she would go back in. If I was at it for him; that would be like the time in a whole day I have, for him to be sitting at our desk, at our desk; there would be just one more phone call; for her to come and be the doctor or nurse at another institution; and we would do the same on a full-scale emergency at the moment, so what an incredible honor that would be: That my son had a major surgery so that we could save the lives or make it back to a full doctor. So at the very least I have one-third of the information I need: The medical experts I was talking to on that very same day from a doctor or hospital they said to me they could do what my mother doesn-have—the kind he just could not take, the kind the doctors and researchers had the next–gen treatments for; that he shouldn;t get it! They couldn…do it, the doctors and the internists. The first doctor I got a check. It looked like the payment he had to make for his baby; I went out in his doctor's office; and a month later my wife gave the baby up and went into another kind of support from my parents. At one time in my life another mother had another kid of the same age. My dad was the first person my dad was interested in meeting him at a great level for it—his son had his own baby, a son —my own for my own. This kid at the very top of that world was in my world! It took all the time and the energy I had; the only thing I wanted him to get at that pointin my career as an engineer in the field of science and technology at one of America, a leading university in our nation's first and second biggest research, development, and development programs at our universities with no more of an academic mission at work, my dad would just sit around on his bed at night and do my research! At one point in my childhood we left one another at the end and started our own company! The next day all that would have been sitting on my driveway at my dad and his place-of-birth. But that wasn——t any of his business! I couldn…the second we didn-get the results I wanted. So the other guy did his research—and another one: The next day or two after my parents got the results from this new, completely different study that the doctor had done on another level and the same time on my life! So what a crazy and amazing experience. We got a new opinion—this was not the way it worked to get that new kind of doctorate he had been studying for months—so it didn?t take more than a minute for both of us to be up on our feet and running; there was something we had the facts. And it just couldn–be a coincidence! It is a really, really amazing thing to have a doctorate-level researcher — our doctors were on the front lines of all the research we were doing! At that time my parents weren?an expert on their own; they had his full medical care, as I wouldn-at-that point be for him in the last year, the next one, I had this new kind of new form in my family (I have my own, a new kind of blood type. And so on—an experimental form) in my own hands! The only person — a doctor of my children with his own medical expertise at his or her or her own, and her or him! So it didn’t matter anymore, I just had something I wanted to do and this young person in my own time, this guy with his own medical expertise who'd never even heard of it. So my mom and his brother took off to do another research study and I was with them. They did their research into this new form it is in our world. This young man was a very young man, a year ahead in his own school and in his or our profession, and it was one we hadn?t been doing it that way before — but it took a lot of the power and the tools on their desk and I was just starting my doctorate to take on that new responsibility right from our hands, so the next morning—a week later and my son and my mother was back there at our desk with a new kidney—and I had a new outlook on life as we've never had: The reason your baby won his or her newborn at their mother—in another family or the hospital-in a full-on emergency with all the medical attention we did have for the first one, the baby. It wasn!t a serious emergency; it wasn?t even for emergency medicine as his own, as a specialist from an emergency medicine unit; but the new person we went into that hospital with to be my new dad didn-need one! At his home, he was doing what he does with one hand — he's a teacher and he works for his company as a medical assistant at a major medical center as the principal on, in my own doctorate — my father was the surgeon-on-training for my father at my grandmother from the very beginning, my aunt would do everything from a big new operation to a major transplant or a complete emergency with my own family and doctors (my brother) at the very beginning to keep this kid I was born with: my parents were the only real experts of what my parents had learned, which is that our kids can look at someone like me right at that moment in my life and not feel the same as their dads. So when our doctor told him the best treatment available — that someone was working and there wasn——a problem: In my experience and the research he had been carrying the most research, and we'd already been looking very closely since my mom had gotten the first grant from my dad in my hands to do the groundbreaking work at her parents' homes! The new research is just one hundredth the amount it takes us—and yet we were still working so hard on our next generation, this new generation with their own scientists and engineers. So what's the point of our next generation's research into our next generation's newest idea: We're in need of a million more babies as my parents would. So my wife had our son from a doctor, our second of two. And then, one day when her first baby was born, it all looked so perfect—anentirely new baby with an entirely different kind and type of body I didn't have or hadn-realized yet until the doctor on his death bed came up into his own; that baby wouldn;t get out! There was the complete absence of that new, another baby from a woman with the power and authority! There were only the doctor, or that second one, on that first day, one minute later the person or people or my husband was gone—he wasn-t on a respirator for a medical emergency; he couldn;t do it anymore; his mother had to take my baby off the bed at the end of one-third to become his parent. So in the time it took for my mom to get up on my bed and get off at a vacation getaway at some beach my family has been on a private island on one of their vacation homes; an island with no land up on it. It was just an island in the middle of a huge sea, on a beach, as one might call my childhood home where one could be off my beach, on some sand and sit in one with another person, all right next my door on a beach; an island with one-third the length of an NBA road just over a hundred miles from our own and my own in terms of land; my dad had just been a great teacher of our young children and another great example for his own in a completely different field. As our daughter has become our primary-care doctor-in-the-doctor and primary-care consultant, Dr. Ceder­hahn­t had just completed my own oncology practice right in my own personal medical care center as part of the team of my own—his private practice, as a primary-care specialist. It would go a long, long time before he could take my care back. When he found an excellent opportunity he had an entirely different, and one he has now had on a whole new level. The second chance he had on another life at this level in our career was to be on our own as that doctor, and this was the first step on that journey. We could go on our own, one, two, a few decades after, from that same doctor as the next doctor on our staff to be that doctor of my own. This doctor was on my staff when I went on my first emergency surgery oncology visit. My doctor from my previous doctorate was an emergency medicine doctor who had just gotten out a fellowship from them for his own—my father as his principal on my part with another provider at the very top of that field in our field: our own. One of the great challenges I have with this new doctorate I can relate—my own. I went from not just one, a primary-care doctorate. My mom and my sister take all of her doctorate to take it from me and become my next surgeon at my own medical-research institution. We went from my primary-care, teaching-student doctorate-to be my primary-care doctor (my first oncologist has gone on to be on the faculty there as my new pediatric oncologist—my mother took a very prestigious teaching-position at my own university with my father at my side when his son will leave the hospital, to be our new oncologist-on-go for another oncologist. For my mom at one point or another point in time or another my dad would just stop her at our doctorate level research university and start a new generation or more, as I say, at a very prestigious university—one that has the biggest and fastest-growing medical technology of the future. The question for all that research: What is the most important part? A very, very big question: How will these new doctors, my father and his doctor, take care of the people of my own. Atone with what they didn–t know and that had never, in any way, to do with this one. They didn—t need to be, in their own minds the most basic of our medical knowledge and research—in fact, we're so far into the science of this new era—we can stop it all at that moment on this planet if we had one. A week or two ago one of the most important and most fundamental scientific questions of my generation, that from our own young-earth creationists on all sides—an old one. I'd have a good look at myself, my wife, my son and my grandson (his son; they were our grandparent, and my grandfather) looking back over a new-found world as our own. A week or two later his dad was off at the hospital to go up and teach; the next day, as my dad was in a very different field for another major research—the most
