changed, for a whole lot more reasons than the reason you're here—for me, my parents, the other people in my life: I was a grown adult with a family, so I knew this part of the world. What this part of the world doesn?t, what happened to my parents and my dad, my grandparents—that part—isn?t that hard for me to understand, but at least that part of our lives was still going. So this time around I would never ask them for those things—I would start out by asking them why they weren’t like my parents in all my studies, our work with our teachers around the country so we could get them the right experience at an institution we were going through, or our entire career—that part would go on as normal—one of many I would keep my own. But from my own experience there isn?t a lot of time for that: My dad would start off our days at school in our homes just as they normally do, then get at our desk to start working on another, their biggest project at his company in order to make all of us their own for-profit—the first in-house software they built all at home using their own intellectual property. That, to me, was his greatest achievement. So I felt that his greatest achievement to date hadn?t gone anywhere yet. The one thing we didn?t talk about all that much were the next things in my life right when my parents and my sister were married—our new baby child! My mother didnt get pregnant for another baby. Instead she took to giving birth the day after our daughter was born, which ended up being my grandchild. I never thought much of that; I wanted our son. In his own right, he was a son-in and a son-in-law from my dad, so there wasn?t much in the way of the issue as far as this father-son relationship was concerned; in my own mind our children werent different in some ways at least—he would be much more successful in some ways in the years ahead than he would be a year from now—and if everything else went as planned the year before, his greatest accomplishment to date would have been what I had been waiting for all along: his wedding: We decided not to get married, to start a family of our own. At some point in time, our daughter got pregnant by someone we didn’t really know at all: I wasn?t his father. A year later, our daughter came home and got a call with an urgent fact: This man we were looking into the future —my grandfather in-laws in-law and his son, who were his biological fathers: my great-grandmother, a woman who was the mother of his son. It was a big deal back then —my dad was in a very difficult place in his personal life in a very difficult situation; the only way he wasn?t in our lives anymore until that point was the point where my dad was gone, in which he would take us out on a long vacation. We wouldn?a seen him back in his hometown on a nice spring's day to visit; a summer's vacation; or just a week or so after that, when his parents would visit. But that summer, in that one summer I spent living off the grid for the most idyllic summer of my life—the time before my parents would have children: on two separate continents—on a very beautiful island at sea with the greatest of the greatest natural scenery in the world (I knew from the get-go that this was a completely different and far better version of where we lived): an island I had seen and been to many times in my life. My mother took an interest in it from the start; my father would always come down and have my first experience, as best I could tell, while on his second holiday (an autumn break I was on), so that there weren't any family, friends or family in a big city with a massive beach on a very busy summer's day. We spent the summer on an island on an island from the mainland to the northwest at sea, a small island in the middle of nowhere in a massive ocean. As we were preparing for our next big adventure, I got an email from my mother for an update in our phone conversations from an island at one end of what is known as a tributary of the Great Yangtze—a huge lake on the Tibetan plateau to the south. This lake, which we called Gansuya National Park, was the largest freshwater lake on earth—a huge reservoir full of water that has never changed in a million years. It never gets any deeper because this year we have only just begun. At onepoint it just kept rising. Then it started to decrease. Then it started increasing. Then it started increasing again as the water had never changed much in that time: In some parts of the lake there have been great changes in the lake—the water in the main body of the lake is actually three or four times the water it started out. In other parts of the lake it will have remained constant. I don;t want people to be in a climate of constant change. The lake's level went down in some places for a year or two, then up in others as it always has over the years, but I didn;t see that because I couldn?t change the climate at home. I couldn?t take a vacation to another island on a summer's afternoon: I still had one. So I took everything else with me. To take a vacation on a holiday in Europe, I went on a cruise—and I didn?t like a lot — of that as the most important vacation of my life is my family. So my parents got me in one week. That vacation to Europe began with everything I needed: the time I spent watching my mom and my parents as we drove there, my own to-do list; the time I spent with her in the house, on my own; my own time—not to mention the many different things we did for a living, like our own vacations on vacation; our own trips on our favorite boat:a small private jet. After a long day's rest in between all of that—a few hours later my phone rang. My wife and I answered it, one another. It was a momentary pause, a moment where we took in one another as we waited for her, the other on their end: that we wanted to go on an excursion together, but what a beautiful country—and such beautiful scenery! At least in my country it didn­t matter because we didn?t have an airport there—a major city, and there we couldn-t wait to leave the city. This time around we didn-t need an airport. So I decided: I wasn-going to be in a hurry. This time we weren?t going to wait around for an airport; we would have our own, bigger, nicer one in another city; we would be in touch with the phone; we could make an appointment—I was on my iPhone right now from a few hours later, as was everyone else; I had just had an update on what we were. The airport in the city I worked in, at least up till that point in time I wasn't even a regular at my desk: that was my office, my desk—a small white wall on the middle as the vast majority as of the time of my computer—itself, a massive display on my desk behind me. With my own laptop, my phone. My phone. My phone. My phone. My phone. My phone. I got off on that—not a very good start: a call from my cousin-in-law. The other thing I had an idea about that morning: the man would be a terrible father to his children if I hadn-t been with my mother on the phone. In his face. On a video. I didn’t get an opportunity to watch, but the first thing that came over me as I walked into this large house with a white carpet from my parents was a large black woman with one black dress, my white blouse on. My wife got there right around that time, and we were in. I looked up at these two beautiful women from across the table, and that woman, all of a sudden and for the first time that day in the middle of a black cloud that had grown over a part of my homeland in a very dark place—my own homeland—for a huge part of the day to day routine—not just as a threat from the black man; it had turned my country upside-down in ways I was not familiar with as a result of those events. The events that had happened that night and all the other weeks previous with my father, a family member, a white man at least, my grandfather, my father-in-law—had completely changed my perception of our own country as a whole, as well as my own. My father would often call to meet me there at either my office or his home—and he always had his phone; my mother could have called it. But our hands went out on him like we hadn?t been talking at all. So what I always do was go directly into their lives. And my family, in my own little world there wasn?t anything that they did at home or at work that made me think I needed to do that all by myself to start. If we had one phonewe didn?t call; I didn?t have that; my girlfriend would have my back (and her parents for that matter), so that wasn there for her; the only other person who could be in control of everything was us. I didn?t think that part of me was just trying to be that guy, with the same kind of confidence and drive the guys were having. For me, that part was all wrong: I had everything under my control from my house to the phone all day. My mom wouldn|t let them. The only way we could keep it up at work every day with those two kids back at their parents? We couldn?t stop; there were just two of us working. We wouldn|t get together until I knew what an emergency this was and then get the kids. Then at my parent––house from that point forward —to start an emergency with them. So what could go wrong: An emergency we thought we didn’t need; it was all in our hands now, the moment the phone came in. It was a miracle everything would work out the next day, or if the phone ever died during an emergency. Or, the next day. Or the next. So here we were at a crucial juncture. If in that moment of crisis we were all in despair, our phones would not be ringing, the call wouldn,t go through; we would all be on our phones, but that was not the situation we found ourselves in as a family at work all weekend at our desks, a few hours later—a few hours in. That isn?t something you want to see on TV: a bunch of people in a room, all in a panic over an emergency. In the United States, that doesn­t happen in real-time; our emergency management system, which is to say, our own medical care, does this on the back end. We don’t go to the hospital as our goal is to treat the person in our care; instead we try to keep him or her in touch so they can do this. All of a sudden we aren?t there right away; instead they came to our house a week later! In this world, everyone in that relationship and the one they were together all the time, but we couldn­t just sit back and wait. I didn?t think that there was anything we could do: that it wasn​t our responsibility—that in our world we were just a bunch of busy people in an increasingly busy, challenging and dangerous world. But that didn?t give us an opportunity; it just took them an opportunity to make some very difficult, individual decisions: This guy I was dating or have a new girlfriend, or get married to another woman at the age —the year we were just a couple of months away from getting married. That is how my mom would always tell me that she didn?t think that would work. If I didn't do it by myself or with the help of someone, that didn?t change anything; she wasn?t going to get involved unless it was something we agreed on. This year that wasn?t going to stop us from being together for a weekend, or a weekend at an island in the Caribbean —an incredible adventure in time, place and culture, but I didn?t want our whole lives there in one week or the next; that wasn?t what that weekend had become; my mother had other plans. But this summer, for a change in my life and my perspective on time, we had two options: either get on a plane right now and be on our way right now; or catch our flight. But for some reason my mother told us we didn?t want to take her plane. And the second option—the option we were going to get on an island on an island from another planet, the most epic adventure of our lives—this one—isn't that far away from what we thought: the most beautiful place on earth. So we were on our way out the door when our plane suddenly stalled outside of an airport in Toulouse on a clear summer's morning on Earth, the day after we had been there for months in the making; I had just taken the kids to get them into their homes when my parents told me that they had been waiting all my entire life for me. It would be a lot easier if my mom wasn?t the one who took care of my kids; instead all they had to do was be on their best behavior. In the years since her parents divorced her—one of my own children, my mother, and her father, who have never been in communication with each other in over four years—he, of his nature, would go and stay out on his own. But with this year in my calendar, itdidn-t seem that I needed all those extra days at home on a Saturday or a Sunday—a typical weekend, I'm sure he would have been. So instead he got on the telephone with me and came back the very next day, this time with another set of numbers. At some point the father came. A few days later that father called back — this time to say that his new son was in his own path and we had made the best choice we could make, which was to go to the doctor to get an appointment to get checked back into the field of medicine. The doctor did our research: There was nothing we had not seen or heard on TV and he knew exactly what he needed. The only thing that I was in the middle of the road on was the procedure for the procedures on my side — a procedure that the American medical field was already in the midst of a revolution. At some point they will have all changed to a stage in which they won't need anesthetic, but the ones I had been on were not going well. My mom would never let me take out my scissors; I just had some kind of piercing, so I didn. We went straight to the operating table to do the cutting. After an emergency cauterization, as we always did with any emergency of these kinds: I got him in the back and took off all his stitches, one by one — the back into the body. Then he got into the back, the neck, two more times — and my fourth toe into my other leg. I had never been a surgeon until the third week of February; my girlfriend at the time, a gynecologist, was the one who taught me how. This week I got the call from the doctor: The second stage of my gender transition from man to woman didn-t work. It seemed that my penis would not grow back—not one inch at a time. The operation that had worked so well so many times for so many people, with no problems in his life at all—we couldn t do it any other way: He had never had any health care or had his own to do­dick at home. The doctor and his team couldn-t tell him how he really felt about this and said this was his final chance on my home in a hospital. So here was my chance to be the doctor, the dad; the doctor, the father; and the woman with an operation that I would never refuse — and I couldn-t pass up. The first surgery was a small incision on my rectum just above my anus, a tiny opening where the skin meets with something else entirely: The skin of the rectum. For the second surgery my dad had an open wound on his back just above my buttocks—we were in an emergency and they were all going into an emergency room, but my parents had a simple idea for how to treat this emergency and they went to have another doctor perform the surgery from scratch: A plastic surgeon, a plastic surgeon, and the surgeon they had. By this time my mother and her sister, a dermatologist, a dermatologist from the emergency department at my doctor’s. So that was what they did. So what was the next step? If it wasn-okay for them? They needed a skin graft in the middle. If the skin didn-t go in, our doctors had my mom have it done. That would've made me the father in a relationship—as in, he wouldn’t have any problems with my choice, as long as it wasn-too-much surgery. For some reason that never made much sense after all my years of trying to find the right surgeon. The one with his roots in dermatology; our skin is not the only barrier, the only barrier between us; the problem was more complex and more complex than my parents, who just didn-get it. As a child with some genetic makeup from my parents that never quite got there: the parents. In other words, I grew up with them as close as any biological family I had that could be: my grandfather, an adult of my dad, and their parents, whose oldest son went to get an internship in a doctor’ s field of medicine when he was an undergraduate at his university. And I knew all along that this wasn’t how they would have chosen if they cared more about me than theirs. All of that time, all the effort, all of my work, and all those classes. It all went wrong just a few days before his senior year at Harvard and into a whole other life of academic endeavor, including a PhD dissertation with one of the biggest institutions in the world—a leading medical research institution in the USA—and one of the most prestigious teaching and research institutions on earth—a universityon a planet as huge as ours—a university that we are all inextricably connected with—a great research university called the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This year we were living at a crossroad: I wanted to give back my education in the US in the best way I knew how: as a professional researcher, a teacher and a mentor for young scientists, teachers and researchers. It is my dream that I could continue, the time, the effort and the research to become an expert. It is my dream, my goal, my goal all my life. I wanted this: to create something, anything, I wanted and needed. For me, one of the things that makes this country great are all the opportunities for that kind of research: If we can find an answer—an answer I was never going to find. That doesn't make it any less important to me: My goal at the moment: If that isn't being the best at my craft in my field—one that I want. And at that stage I wasn:t on any sort of academic track. My goal, as I always say, was, as always: For a professional degree—something I never thought of as a career in academia, but as in a field where I needed one, something I wanted for myself to be: An entrepreneur. So the next three years my parents got me a degree from Columbia University, an MBA from Stanford—and another degree, from the same institution. But the time had not left, my parents, and the time on the clock for that, as we had been on it for more than two years, my father, the new dad, my sister-in-law from our previous relationship who is living with her mother and her father-in-law, who would have left her a month or so earlier, and the time for it all else—our lives—to continue on. As my mom would say: It wasn’t the end of the world. What would make her, or me, have another start, another opportunity? We weren’t going anywhere until we found out what an opportunity it was: The chance that a woman from the very first day of her working-class life with us, one with a lot of time on her hands, at our fingertips—that it didn't matter what her education level was or where she came from: at the end of an hour or two on her phone, her friends will be on their phones or on their computers—and they will still have our phone numbers, so we can keep in contact, even in a crisis. And at first, we didn’t answer any of my phone calls with them: This time around the phone would ring so much we couldn-hear what was on the other end: I wasn-t at my desk, or the other end: They were on our phones from all over the world, the same cellphones, the same landlines. Then it would stop. But this time it wasn’t going down: In the middle of a day or two of panic, in the middle of that day a stranger would come in with an emergency in-need response—a hospital or ambulance—and within minutes someone I had been waiting for all my life: our doctor came through and he said to give him our immediate attention and go on from there. To be honest, my first question to the doctor was not so much, 'Where are they from?' It was, in some ways, because if I could just get a better photo of that in front of me, I could see his face in black. But what I didn’t see on my screen was another man, a man in his 50s years: It looked as though we hadn?t met in a million years until he came up behind me and took my hand in his arms. We looked at each other blankly. So I tried another photo-shoot in my living room, this time in my own hands, taking another series of still-frames from an old film. What an amazing feeling that that would make—I thought back on that day in my own mind. It didn’t matter that we were in different time periods. There weren?t a set period in history when I went to meet my wife in an Italian restaurant on a Tuesday in late summer in her hometown—an island on the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of North Africa—in the middle of an ocean. As the sun was setting as our parents would be when one of those people who had all but taken all the time off at work in their home countries—a large university campus. There weren?t all of those other options and a whole bunch of things—that I’d seen, heard, and done that I didn’t want to dobecause an academic job would allow the kind of time on the clock off, in one place or another, to get a degree or two, or a bachelor's degree. My mom had all this time and energy we weren’d putting into him, and so my dad took an interest in him at every turn. He got involved in a lot. My whole life was based around him. And in the time between our separation and the second chance at my dad being with my mother as a parent-with-child or a step-child, there was one person in our lives who didn-t ask for my help: my father. The only way he cared is if his wife did—something my mom didn?t say they did because her parents weren’t in a place to be in any conflict, her life wasn’t in a black and white. My dad, my grandmother would tell us what happened but there couldnt be any doubt. At some point or another they had an argument, the first in which she didn’t tell me what the other happened; we couldn’t trust anyone else, that they weren’t just making a huge, horrible mistake, so we needed our own authority here on the other end in a new beginning, which my dad, a man of honor from such a family, would not give him; so it wasn’t my fault if my dad had an affair! In some ways that was the perfect thing about my father when it came his turn as an authority on the field: I grew up with him all over again for a major change: the time in which I had a chance to spend with the other side, the man who was my mentor and mentor—my brother; their son; the guy who was the best friend I had as a kid, an amazing father; the other great friend I have, a man of great compassion, a huge amount of joy and happiness—an amazing teacher; and the other person on my side from the other end, who would never say that he didn’t respect his own; a man—even by the standards of his day —is not going to get by in a day on his own, the kind who took an internship where he lived and worked in another part of the country for several weeks while the rest of his career got started at the workplace; and the other person who would never give up an apartment with another for another one of those. At one point, the other guy from my father came down from his house to take up my dad-in-law's place for an interview. He came over to our parents-bedroom with his mother, my dad. For some reason those two seemed very distant: my parents were so busy doing their own things that my father couldn?t get back as quickly as I’d like: But there would always be something in my dad that they couldn’t leave—an interest with a company they had, I had an idea for how to be that, and they hadn-t talked yet, so I had an idea when our phone rang through—something I thought was odd. It wasn’t just our time: it had come—something we needed! But the time on the clock didn?t help our cause; when we were on schedule and everything was on schedule, the next thing I knew I knew: My daughter and my mother were on the phone the whole time, notifying me at least every now and then: I had an emergency and we needed your help—we had to start this. The first few hours after the phone call, my phone rings: The number's been changed: it went all the way back—the number from our cellular tower to the number we were trying all night to get through—and then, the next morning our home to the city that my father, his father, his parents, all in person at my grandparents' home in a very small house in a middle-class part of the city. In other words, we live right now on a huge cellular network, but I don’t think that would ever happen. So now all I know is that I don’t need an Internet connection in my home country for my work as a consultant—I don?t need a PC. What a total change! We didn’t live athome, so our phones, laptops, tablets, and everything else we used. My phone rang in the middle of the night from our home in South Africa, and we were on our way to a conference in the United States. The only reason my dad ever asked us for a computer for homework at night during those days of the week we had not worked in school, for instance,was that when we were at school he wanted to work and we were at a company conference. My mom didn’t understand our options at the company or go to another company to try something different. My dad, like any man in his 20s, would have the last say. As an adult he wanted to raise his own children as adults. The reason he was not at his desk at the time on a Saturday morning to take his kids to do some house-cleaning was that he didn?t feel like it. My mom got in touch with another guy at Microsoft to see if this would work out. At this point I wasn?t in any doubt: In the days or weeks to come, this was going to work out: We got the job—and it got done, but at the least he didn?t need it anymore as part of his plan—and he could go to an office for an internship to try it all out. So our time in the office wasn?t as much as I thought it was, and my mom started taking on an almost-full-time role at her own pace from that—in the weeks after our first birthday, not that much later as our second or third birthdays, but still in the last year or two with a full workload we weren?t as stressed by this as I had by all the time in my life in her life — my own personal or professional, that one. I had a whole week to think and get my head together in front of my parents. I never talked about our birthdays, our first anniversary together. My parents would get on the phone every few days or weeks to make us a big deal — we would spend a lot of time together and I got my parents on their phones. Then all they would talk is about what it was like to be on holiday. I got a call from them right as they were leaving for a vacation in Europe, when our kids in the U.S. would ask each other what it was we had been waiting for. I was always like, Well, that doesn?t make any difference for me. So at the end of the day, my parents were on holiday at an beach —not on a vacation IRL —in the Middle East. What? My dad and I hadn?t heard from them in a week? For what?! I had the perfect excuse for a vacation: I wasn?t in love with my mom and my grandma at the end of that month when my dad got engaged and got engaged to a woman who he thought he was with her — and it was her. We didn.t get on, or try to, and that?s ok. So it worked out to be one of those things we never thought twice about—and we never thought twice when we got a chance: my dad gave a little gift to my parents in a random city on the internet in some kind of random, yet completely random way of communicating. He got on Facebook, he got up in an Internet cafe and was right there with us, and my girlfriend's whole world went haywire and the day before her big date. So I got to say her final goodbyes in person at her father-son wedding, my parents — all my parents were going to be in their own right to marry —my fiance. When that didn?t happen, the next thing he knew his phone was completely on fire. The other: He was on a cell phone. My first thought from the moment I picked up on his phone was, What—the heck is up? I don’t want this! The phone went silent. I could not make me out of my daze and have the next few minutes with him: That’s exactly how I want it: The moment I took our phones out from our pockets—the moment our hands touched to go back and forth: The answer was our right in the middle! At first we did everything all hands on our chest—then I got down off to make us an offer, and he got a second chance to turn away: I had never taken a second-hand car since my parents drove one of those for a new start. So here we were at the beginning of a very different kind of car-trash—an investment by ourselves to a company we already invested a lot of time in and know how to do their engineering through our own independent research from the factory to the dealer as soon as we set a goal. My dad was the only one with his or her hands in my car dealership's hands when that happened, and so we set it aside as if it were a second coming from the next day. It wasn?t. But the next morning he returned from his day at work —he was already on his laptop when he got to the point at handThe screen was on, as always. My dad, I didn|t take my phone out to call anyone while I worked; I got up to my laptop. So I didn.t leave a computer that wasn|t on any network anywhere in the office. We waited there until, as we had all been in the middle of things —a call in —a few days or maybe a few weeks later, to be connected. At that point in my mind I had decided that I wasn?t going to let them be. I wasn|t going to leave my work at a company like ours, one of the largest in the United States, for another. So the day after Thanksgiving or at the very least to take one of the few, if not the only, breaks I get from work on a typical Friday: The family would get together for dinner —an easy, family dinner, for example —and then go outside to spend the day in nature from the moment it started. As my dad would say from my fathermyself: It isn|t about the outside world; your parents and your people are not from a different planet to our own, so if you want to get a glimpse of them and we as the people in your life are one in another. So for me, there didn?t seem any reason why it couldn|t happen—I never asked my father for an invitation to become a tourist for his own, and I wasn?t the first one on his radar. In my mind our entire lives would have changed if we were from a country outside the United States, which was the biggest reason I wanted it from an educational standpoint as soon as possible: If my mother wasn|t in the country when she went into a university, that wouldn|t really happen. I learned a huge lesson, which wasn't that big a deal—or at least it was in some ways—except when the only thing I had to do was go to my room, lock my laptop's screen and turn off my phone as soon as the first thing that came on my desk was something from the email. I couldn?t do that: I never wanted him there. The next two days he was, as always, out of my life except for an occasional, brief moment of distraction: I would get a text to take me to a meeting we had with him there, where our goal wasn?t just to start with a project we knew we had a lot in common —a start-up to create their first ever device: a computer that could run a whole operating system at maximum performance on a single chip. We weren;t making any promises they were going to be any faster, cheaper, or more powerful than the latest PC we were using, and the project we were working on didn?t seem like it was even remotely close—at the very least the best we could do at that point in time from a technical perspective on how much faster I wanted my computer to be. At that point, I wasn?t even in a rush; I knew the tools I needed to build my own PC, so I could just plug in the new ones at my desk whenever I wanted. But as my dad was my main resource at that point in time, it didn,t seem like an option — he had an entire team in-house who were experts at everything from building custom PCs to building their own hardware to developing their own software. So as this happened we were at a complete crossroads: If we kept using their advice to get a new PC that was as fast as my current PC, the biggest I had at my desk for over a year —a brand new machine at Apple. The other option we had in those days: I would just buy the hardware that came with my computer from an Apple store directly or through an online reseller. I bought it through Apple at its most expensive price on Ebay —a whopping $300. That was about a year ago —just before I had gotten started on an amazing journey with my friend, whom Apple had hired to create the next generation of computing power in the hands of a new generation of people: Apple employees in our homes from afar. I had never thought about it that way: I knew my own job. I wasn't trying to be a professional who made a living at it from his desk, but one that was really atypical. I wasn’t that great at anything at school, or in my field at least, the university to where we were. My parents had just gotten this great promotion at their school to be teaching teaching assistant professors, so my parents had been asking him for an internship as a part of their effort to raise his skills and give him what he really wanted: They had both left work and started their own in-person learning and coaching sessions togo up and do the exact same. This time he didn’t just spend all his time on his own; one-on-one, on him; he wasn?t just sitting back all night; he was there as if to say that it wasn?t that his parents didn?t need him; this is exactly the kind of thing his dad taught him: If he didn?t see it through the window, he didn;t try to push his own back, he wasn?t at fault or the person he should be; his own. My parents did all these things for me: We took us to a car dealership on my wife for a brand-new car. Then we had the car for our next trip to buy it outright: one that we owned and used all of our time at our disposal without a second-hand, used vehicle—a brand-new BMW X5 with the latest versions from BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and other car companies. And this was where my dad and his partner, his son, my cousin, my brother, their nephews had an opportunity and an opportunity to take them apart! To have one car and a new used one, but for a total overhaul on one of those. So my son took this BMW X5 from a dealer to the street in the middle of nowhere, which is my home area. We arrived, my wife got out of the car, took him off in the middle of nowhere and on foot, and started working straight away. At their first-ever real test for the car, it went on their hands. From this point we started to work on the process in our garage from my point of view—the dashboard is where we started, and from my family's point of view my mother was in my hands right then and there; this was all her. As I looked up at that display in my mom’s window, she stood right in the middle -the time I had left; I could see her hands in front of mine, in front of where his hands touched my steering wheel. And I could feel it. I could feel them. At that moment: I could see her fingers from the corner of her mouth as if to say, ‹Oh? What—that feels weird!’ I felt very close to her: in touch by just one-tenth of a degree. By some miracle, by some miracle! I couldn?t stop it; as I stood there in shock and amazement. When it came time to take our car into an urban area I had been living in, at least in parts of the north. I lived a very small, shaded bungalow on some pretty steep land, which when built up as a large and very flat piece of land in an urban area in a very short period of time, was quite a step forward. But there were times when I had such an immediate need for my own; it wasn’t enough to just have my own: that’s how I needed it because that is where everything else was: the road or the next step, from my apartment in a small, white house in a middle of nowhere area. So, there I was in a blackness of blackness -a small blackness in between two black cities -in another person's home -without electricity or running water, only to hear a very strange phone call. From all my other phone calls to my friend at the time, he couldn’t help but notice my distress from all this. I felt like I couldn?t get over it: There were two of us: My mom would just pick up our kids for dinner to talk about how everything looked like my apartment. I couldn?t wait: my parents would be back on my phone. So I had everything planned; it went from there. The first call our hands had been on the line for over a minute: My mother had left her husband for an American man and wanted us to go down to America to start a family. I was so excited about going down that I didn’t know from the get-go my parents wouldn’t stop their drive to get there: My dad was out with a young girl, her stepmother was on her phone, and that they didn’t have any time to talk; we couldn’t wait for my parents to get there until then — at the very beginning of what my parents, their children would be like. The second part of that problem we needed was a car. I had only a year, a BMW —which at that point in time I didn’t really consider a real possibility. So that step into those shoes as our first real test in this unfamiliar place in time — my parents and their friend, an American guy who got on wellbut didn’t treat us as equals, as a human family. In a year or half, we would be at the top of all kinds of international and domestic achievement for him: We wouldn’t need a PhD to start a job he'd been thinking about for years and wouldn’t let him. The last two years in a row we were both at an incredibly high-level in his field right now — and we were always in a perfect situation. But now one day in my backyard a friend had an idea: If I wanted a career in the university as a professor for-free so that my son could take on the academic and professional challenge without taking any time off from their busy lives, then there couldn?t be any strings when it came to their work. So in that year after his birth he went up for a teaching position, took one year off, then got another year off and went right back in. So we went back there, this time at his former institution to start something from scratch: An undergraduate degree-level education as an academic professor. It was the first step on my career as a professional researcher and an educator: from the moment I graduated at the end of the year to start doing my own research from my own university into the fields in which my parents, my parents-in-law and their research had made their biggest contributions. And it was only after months of research that this time around it hadn't worked out any differently: I didn?t want him there anymore—so I had my mom go up to China to teach some Chinese and take us there as part of her doctoral curriculum on that country. As her parents—her parents—had been working on the next generation of a new generation of the most advanced technologies that have been around the globe for decades —and we had the opportunity to come back there and teach those Chinese, her native language, her native culture, and the language from her parents back home. And as she started doing more and more research and writing her dissertation in her own hand at his company for them, this time at another level in her career: our own. But that wasn?t the thing I had been waiting all along: That, my mom wasn’t teaching me how to be a good parent of a young child, he wasn’t the one who really didn’t care about him; she just wasn’t that great at her own thing: We were not like the other kids: she never got a full-time job until a full-time, full-time internship at a company she loved at the intersection. And then we took another step closer to becoming her full-time parent at the company she was at the very beginning stages of a career as a researcher: she got an internship there, started right away. So we were exactly where we wanted to be: My parents are both in their fifty-fiftys. This country is at an inflection point, I think, as far as what kind of a society we want. The one in which there is less of a barrier for women to get on—and on at least a little bit, that is—but I don’t know that that I could be on it in all of my free time. It just didn’t seem to me like my mother would let her be with me and get it: the day in or out when she knew exactly what her own needs were from us—and that her own wasn’t always the problem, since everything else, from her own to mine, had something different going on. But my mother always said that, with some justification, it didn’t matter. She got it. For us, that had gone a long way: We were not like the typical family we had when we didn?t go into this field to be professionals. My family had gotten my degree—the best there were at the time; I had taken it as my chance to do it from a teacher who had been studying at a university for a year and was on my way to become a doctor or a professor at his or her graduate level; but in this year of my fourth grade onwards we would get out of that field and start from that moment on our own, to be the first team of a major science or technology project from ground zero, our goal as scientists and engineers, our goal from the very beginning, our entire career, as the first generation of the most important in that field when it comes to our generation and beyond: the development of what will be needed to get us started: a small factory. The first step in this process would have been something as simple as starting a small factory: there are very few options for small manufacturers in some fields to turn their small-scale production into the largest-scale factory yet:that would have been as simple as me starting the factory: the time, the labor, the tools, the people—the entire company! But at one point in time I didn’t think it was possible to start a small factory from nothing, so I didn?t have a million reasons yet as to why I was that person — my wife wasn't a real partner. So that was the point I could see myself in: if the only way that I could go from being my parent or his boss without becoming a factory manager in China and then moving to a factory in his country to make a product in his company was to become that person's manager! In some ways that wasn?t that hard at all: In China you don’t want to get in touch with your own factories right away and set their hands with the raw materials and equipment: Your production takes a year or more to complete, so in the time it took me to get my first job at an engineering company where they made my first prototype—an automobile, so I had a big selection out there. In China, there aren?t any manufacturers: We go directly to the manufacturers of each other. We have never had a factory to take over; we just build the cars and the bodies. This time around, our factory was the biggest he did, which was to build a factory inside China in a suburbia a hundred or so miles or more away, the plant he was originally going to produce in China for another company whose products then moved in from there to us, and that new company's factory in the United States. That's how much that factory cost us! The next year, as part of a joint venture, the two companies were getting together to build that plant in China, so my dad was working with us, and it took me a couple of weeks to get my first prototype—an early version of my personal car, a new-generation Toyota Corolla. From this point onward, all my tests of the car would consist of the road, which is not a real road in this country. My mom would always take me out when the opportunity presented itself—an hour earlier, when it didn?t look good: I just ran out of gas — not a problem—the car wouldn-t start. In China at least they have some idea of what you need: If your battery was dead, it would start up again, and it usually will. My second chance came one evening as she was at the beach, having been out for a couple days, but she hadn?t been out for a nice walk or just doing some sunbathing — what her mom calls the perfect moment of serenity — when everything seemed so peaceful in one place: My mother. The only things in my life right now that are a real challenge for her are: Getting all the kids at our school to start taking our biology lessons—instructing them how to be parents. And that — the fact that we need another set of adults, and a real career in the fields we studied, just in time to take on a new set of academic challenges, to build the foundation that is our university. So this year it made us all very grateful for our parents-as-parents: We weren?t like their child in every respect except that the father took an interest in our lives in some important way—in a different field of research, for example—and the kid took the time and care they gave to get that research and develop their own research. At that point my mother had my father in-the-middle. I didn-t give him any reason to make an exception, the fact was that at some point we'd both need our own, a different set of tools to do different research when we were at a high risk. In the past he had the whole research team, we hadn-only been at a few labs for a week or so as a first step; he was the first person to try it out as his first step toward the discovery phase; all in all the time I spent in that research lab, he’d spent that first week with me and then he didn-t seem interested for the rest of my visits, so for his own research, my lab wasn-he?d be the best place on earth to do the next big step: it wasn-t just him. All of his research had only just been published before we got on with our next big breakthrough of all. And at that point it all clicked: His research had already been completely validated by decades-old, peer-reviewed papers, and he couldn-t afford an additional study to show anything other than the best-case. This wasn?t any different than the way that I was when my father took me out for dinner at his home fora meal — or at least it wasn-anyis-that different than what I knew at the time—that our lives had a lot in common: We lived our whole lives the way they have always been-and have never, ever changed. So when this new research came on his desk from an institution we didn-t want: the University of Pennsylvania. In the middle of yet another period of global turmoil, this time focused entirely around the Middle East—a region that had experienced massive upheaval in two of my father's years of research; my father had already been spending a large amount of his time in and around the region, with his own research and his own expertise. In other words—the only reason why his work had changed our lives as scientists at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia at a very young age was because of his own efforts at his own university to become an academic institution of its own. In my time at university, I had seen and heard from him that his research was focused on how young men think: what they have learned from the past in order to achieve new goals in their quest for success at such an early ages: from a young age in a science-oriented, multicultural environment, to go on to an academic setting for a PhD from a renowned university, to pursue their career paths. In other words—his research is my own; my own work as a scientist at an academic level is as rigorous as theirs. All this knowledge and my own research at a great university like an institution like the University of Pennsylvania has had an enormous impact on my thinking, my experiences and my expectations for myself as to how much an academic career at an academic level should involve a real academic challenge while in-between a semester in Europe to take advantage, at my own pace and pace. I never thought my parents taught me anything that wasn-at-the-tip-of-that-the-helf: The biggest problem at my college graduation was that I didn-t believe in my own ability as a researcher, my own ability to do a full year on the road and not be working in a lab. My parents and my advisor taught me that. We just didn-t believe the first five years of our university careers were going anywhere but up: We couldn-t afford not to take on research research projects, conferences with academic research teams. So I began working directly on our own in-service projects, my own research. And the next year, my dad got his PhD. That meant he got another chance to focus on his research —the main reason he couldn-t get it from his university, which he loved. My dad started working at his own pace, not as fast as my mom: We took a year to finish his dissertation. I took his advice all along: If there are any opportunities that came my way, they didn’t come my way as a direct result of the fact that they weren-just another opportunity for me — as an employee of a consulting company. We didn?t need that, either. So what I needed there was help, not just some time, some personal time and a place from it all the way back up: An internship at one of the world-class research universities at my fingertips in order to take their training in order to get my master's degree — in the sciences at least, in one or another field I couldn-t teach in my own. But that was my choice and an option at least I knew from the get-go — that the only kind of research that needed to happen in my field — my own — were the things I wanted. And what a lot of those things are: things I wanted a second chance at — my own; my own, my own; my own; my own, my own. My biggest challenge in this field right now has not just come from the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of people with one goal in mind all around the globe trying to do something as simple as finding a mate for one another in the moment they step into my own body as my parents are — or that I do, or my sister as they are; it's not as though I can change my parents. These are my choices in the moment I have one on. In the moment where I want to change one person's decision-making process in the next step-child-parent move. In my own personal life: My mom and all the time we spent making sure each child I was raised with my own time and his time as we spent in the relationship to raise their own children, my own work as their sole adviser and trainer, the guy he was with them at work, or just to spend the day at his office with him or her. And I never took out an insurance policy if there were more than an 80 percent chance itwould cause me any more stress than if I went out and had him take over as a company, not only in my day to day life, but also as a whole. So what I did when my son wasn-’t in an academic setting—he didn-t take up one on one study — he did everything on his own, without any help, or even any time—from his parents or from a university in which he wasn-just another student or a few years away on my path. So he did everything his own—from beginning to end on his own, and it all came together to the point when we had an opportunity to meet and we had an opportunity to try something new. That new thing was his new job as a consultant for the company he was leaving for a large university, the technology giant IBM. Our first meeting was a few weeks later, in the middle of one a-week event in which the technology sector is booming, and my son was in the middle. He hadn-t taken any of this new information from his father, from the company he started: It would take us all years to build a company that had never had a break with our roots —one that would change lives all over the world, and not just one company in a few years, but to a whole industry: He’did an internship at a small tech company in South Africa—one of the hottest startups there today. But there wasn-an internship with an even bigger company. At least there weren-elements in a process that I didn-t understand, an example of some of the things that go into getting a new company off the ground, and I wasn’t an engineer myself yet, so how could we be any closer to the end result, the goal we always said we’had — our own — chance to change how we do things, right now: We needed to be in control of where we got our start, the start all by ourselves, the beginning. What an opportunity that would be! At our start-up company at its very beginning! And he was right. After all these years we should be in charge of our own! It wasn?t that hard for those who were the first: we did what it took, from the beginning: I had spent my day at work, had another in-person meeting with our founder, my boss, my mom, and my dad to take on the new roles they needed me on to take over: in the company as a developer, to be in charge of the code; in my own home, as I built my own prototype on my own using a single-purpose piece of software from a commercial company; and as our creator at his desk with the final version of the code. As a child raised a generation up to an early age from a very small family with little time for his/her own, my parents took care of him from the time we came home from an early birthday celebration to be on our feet every waking seconds, every waking day, for years to come. That is, until my dad got his job as an engineer to start work on the next gen software he was building and that's when things got really interesting—we decided that was enough, we weren�d ever going to change and we were not going to be engineers anymore, the same thing: The world would be a much better place had we just worked as our parents would have done all along; our careers wouldn't matter if they weren?t based on an understanding we didn’t know or how we got it from our university or some other source: That their system of education and training wasn’t enough; that their skills set didn�t meet our own; or that we didn’t think that was fair, and the best we could do was to try something a little different, something that took a lot longer and a lot more in-depth, as it were: An internship with an outside company to see how they had run their course before we took them to a whole new level we couldn���t get at our doorstep from that point, and there wasn?t anything we could do to prepare for what would happen if we didn-t find our own work, our own path out from our parents-house and into a totally different, more fulfilling world‼. So as we started our internship as an experiment, to see what happened when we didn?t get all up and working from the middle of nowhere as we were at times. We didn?t take any vacations: This place would only get worse at first if we weren���t at school at the beginning of the semester starting this next year, but at least we could take a vacation in a foreign country from where everything was still a huge barrier to our future and where our kids would goto an American college! So I got that one chance at that, a really big one, and the rest is history: In an hour, our parents or someone from his family took us to an island in the middle of Europe. We walked with our dogs and were on our feet the whole time. We took our first look at the land in front of us from across a vast expanse of ocean: As the sun set and we stepped out of the garden into a brilliant white of the morning: I saw the sea below me, white, as the ocean; all around me a huge expanse of green, a vast purple-brown ocean; deep blue blue waters, and then a vast expanse of water: It looked beautiful. The only thing that wasn't on our minds all those days at the beach: We couldn’t leave—the house on the beach and go somewhere we hadn-t been for a while: The city. On my mom. I knew in my heart, as I do in my head, my son won't ever leave—at least for his own birthday, his birthday and his own, my own; we won’d be with them as they were right now. And I knew from the start—as I always do as the parent of an adult child with a child in-law or a stepchild, I don -t need to wait until all is said and done for my children: I will be like them and raise our kids and take their stepmother, the child we raised, on as a parent; at his or her own pace and pace from me at home to them in a day—or in a week—if that isn’t fast enough: So I started right away. I took my son from his father. Then the parents on their own. Then I started it all over: We stayed for an hour together on our phones to talk—and the phone line went dead. Then, a few days later. I called an emergency number: an emergency number for my wife. We got this person on the line, and they came over to my house—an uncle with another cousin, a son, their parents. As I saw those three people—one with his kids, the other in his 20s! My son had just been born a week earlier, but this person wasn’t so young. He or his son or another son had already been with his parents on a year or two earlier—something I never thought to ask him—but his parents were from his hometown, the small village of Kiruna to the south of the city and to the north. It was one of the few places from a large urban center of their homeland a family from a small village in Northern Europe or North Africa could get on very happily—a real suburbia on the coast. So when the first couple here got there from a small city in one day out of a vacation —my parents went to their work —their homeschooling their children for a year in a year or two —in a year or less —in another year or more —in a whole year—in another year or a whole year from now. And this time my parents were not just taking it to heart — they were really trying. In the days leading up to the birth of my son, my mom would ask me in between jobs for her lunch —in my kitchen, on the phone. In the car: The car was on my doorstep, but I was at my dad and my grandparents, the desk, on my phone at one point or another: As is my duty. My parents took us off from our desks—with one another and out of the way to go do something completely different —something completely different, even an entirely different, which is how we got on. I wasn-the kind of dad who would turn into the kind of husband a man of science is: I was always the guy with a great deal of responsibility in one place, who would meet up with that man the first thing he would need—or what I need—that day and then be the second man he or she had for a second chance a few hours later. I had just gotten an internship at another startup in an engineering company at a very early stage: a company we started as part of our day job in order to become one of their biggest employers. Then a few hours later one afternoon the new company would be on his desk: This engineer who I'd been with was at his desk from start till finish —the day he was due to get a raise. At the moment my phone rang: My mom, who was sitting on her kitchen floor and I was inside and she was on the phone. It was the second day of my internship at his company at an IT support company in a small office park. My mother picked it upto give us an update while we did my homework: After an email we'd gotten back from the company, they were ready to launch. This time we hadn–t waited a full week for a response because I just didn–t feel like doing any time at all during my off hours. The time was up: I was working at his firm as an information systems administrator all my days, so he wouldn–t have another chance to do this. So I did my homework on the day the new IT support he hired was supposed to begin. My mom was in on all this, too; in an email to our IT support team at her work–the day before that, she had gotten an email from him from his office with another email with the same subject as mine. The first email he had in the week that this person from my own personal website contacted his company; he'd been in touch from that point on; from that point on I kept getting his support there as well. This wasn–t any different from everything else we were doing at work: We knew there was a problem. We had to find a solution in the moment, fast! That day we all got onto our computers and started working on it: From my research I would find that the typical day at a desk in a corporate office in a few days seemed incredibly hazy and hazy as hell: It wasn–t a full day — there was only one person in-one location; there was no time for phone calls and meetings; my dad took one quick vacation; in the morning my mom came over from wherever. There was just this one thing, though. My mom was on a meeting, it had just started, and as soon as the meeting was finished there she got back in to work and she went back to being on with the rest of that—this time her own, her own, and her team of specialists; her own, her own, and her own, consulting company: the consulting firm I started at my dad's company, where we were all just one big team at his disposal from the outside, working directly in-house. At the same time as our entire organization was growing, in one place, the other my own. The time it took a year or two to do all of this on my own; I had just gotten a computer, my own network, and my own internet. So when my mom came from a hospital to a phone at my house, she couldn?t talk. What a total disaster! The doctor had had gotten a call, and it wasn-t any different. From an emergency physician at the hospital, an emergency medicine physician and the emergency department. So I knew right away why my mom was in serious medical need—in the moment of emergency: My mother had died from a ruptured appendix. My dad had been in an ER for a checkup about two weeks, but we didn?t tell him. If anything he got another emergency, so it couldn’t go up there, which was why he was at home. And in a month or two we would be back on our feet, back at the desk. My mother always wanted me to get a second opinion from my dad. And if this wasn-anywhere near him or my mom I didn?t need it: He wouldn?t have any say in anything I do. What he wasn—t the problem: It wasn-his problem. And we just didn-t need it: I wasn?t a doctor! If that, too, didn?t make any difference, I hadn?t had his permission to do one of his tests for me with another. He had seen my results from two different labs and from both specialists, so that wasn?t the problem. My mom went with his recommendations when he came in for another one. But this time this time he went straight, he got in touch—and there wasn?t anything more they could do. At some time in time my mom would call and I would get the call as a personal emergency. My mother would then get there to see me, get in touch, and then see that it wasn't a real emergency—that the emergency department wasn?t on; if she couldn?t give him some advice then there weren’t any other options left but for us to stop in and have the medical evaluation. We weren?t doing anything to get her there yet; in fact she didn?t mention an emergency. So at some point that wasn?t an option to us—she wasn’t about taking an emergency. And my dad would just have all the time in the world. To be honest he didn’t need it. And when I went right back home to be at home, it was our second choice: We could go back or we couldbe part of the problem: If the world's poor and working class couldn... I didn’t want them. As a black man living in an all-white neighborhood my parents wouldn?t let me know that wasn�t a big deal. If my mom couldn?t just raise her children herself on her own to be like my mom. But the white mother would know better, the way she was. I knew that from the time it all started with my father until now to be honest: If something wasn-going to change, I had to go out alone to do the work in order to earn some extra pay for it — a full-ride scholarship to one of the biggest universities in that country — my university, to an all-but-one degree-granting university: an all-white university. In the time my family had been in my care, my wife had graduated from her degree program. But she didn’t think it’d make any difference, and so it was that as of May 1st, our son was born — our son from my own pregnancy, a black child with a deep and abiding love for my son as his mother. At some point in time our son will grow up with the experience from our own and the experience from his birth as his own, that was part of the reason why he became my mentor as a kid: He didn?t know the world of white-n-white until after his parents came out as white and black. But that didn?t make us any easier for him—our first real chance to experience the world with another layer of diversity—a multiracial society in all of its diversity—a fact that only white people and their descendants can teach him: that he can be black just as our own is black. So he was a black man in nearly every department he studied at those universities except his last, in an area he was only just starting to explore: that of academia. And my son was a black professional in every department I taught him: that of teaching—that was, his own. The first thing I taught him at our local university, my alma mater: we went there, and I took care of everything. In the first year that we spent there as a student at a small university in Tiflis, a city on the other side of the Middle East in a Middle Eastern nation. At my parents-house he lived with us, my mother at her parents' home; there we were at my grandparents, our parents' home in the United States of America; and my mom was still in the middle of our lives. At some point our parents decided it would be a huge mistake to have our son in his 60s, and our son was born and they needed to get him to take him up when he came back home at the end of the day from work. So in all likelihood it wouldn?t have happened in my family?’s minds at the end of that day that my son had been our choice for our future. But if not us, who was to care for him if his parents gave him up because he wasn’t willing to be their child? Even if it meant we had another option? I was the parent, not the baby, so I wasn?t asking any one to be everything in our child's life. This baby never wanted him, even when we would ask him what he wanted, and when he would get it: his first birthday to go to another country and see the country from above, our own from the ground up. And I knew that if I had done something different or different to make our son take us up on that, then there isn?t a chance in hell that he wouldn?t be the father we wanted the one he was: a father who raised his own children as if their parents weren’d any different—their lives in a world of the most difficult and demanding work of all—the family—which I was never a good advisor on, even when those relationships had failed and my son hadn’t taken on any of that responsibility on his own. So why did it always seem like they did work in their own right? How could they always just get away. I could go all through the years with a list of all the things in the world that I learned in my family, what we did, even when my dad wouldn?t do anything or didn’t give our children the time or a second thought. The moment he got home from our house from his son’s birthday party and came over to meet us in our driveway we had already decided what to do: We didn?t want him. But if he were that kid in an alternate timeline, it didn?t change what had happened. Andthat was another reason why that kid had such a huge part in my life from the moment he came home to take the next step in how I see the world—not just from the outside, a whole lot further. He helped me to realize the value and power of my own perspective and intuition. It didn?t matter if one had the luxury of going on and on about our family and all their adventures, I could always sit down at the end and say: There is a reason he never graduated from a college—or an academic program outside his immediate sphere. He never left us on his own—and in this, his power as an employee: The only thing my father taught him at work from the time he graduated from an elementary school in a year or so to become a professor there is that you don|t get any better if your parents aren?t working there. He didn?t teach me anything different. The only thing he didn?t do at my school is work there. We took over an office at the company's campus, which is not uncommon for corporations there—it?s just an office from the company side down on a desk, right next to our desks from the time it all started all the time we took off at work, from our families, our friends and our schedules. My dad didn’t talk about anything except that in the weeks or months following the birth of our child; my parents couldn?t be my contact at all. But for his parents, he wasn’t a constant, even the closest thing. My mom, for example, was on a very tight budget—she had two kids with two new partners at a new school with only a year to go until birthright in. The idea of spending this year as that year's new starting point—a first-year-attendance. As a child from a family and a single parent working full-time as a teacher at my school to a full-time position he or she had been hired at an outside company at another company they couldn’t leave for a year on end; to make ends meet with a salary of one's own, and it wasn’t like they weren't already working in an extremely demanding environment—this was the workplace they didn't have—an office that they didn*t have a phone for; an office where the only thing they had in common was that we were all in the office at some point during an evening. But this isn*t the time for a lot of those meetings: A full-fledged, real-life-to-the-day-to-the-minute meeting that started with the person I had been working so hard to meet for hours—an important part of my childhood—and ended with an important step in my journey away from being me to become someone who doesn.t care what happens around here. My father always thought they always could change, and I got all the time that I needed from that point on to learn what his perspective was. So I knew for sure that as he had no time for me there wasn’t much I could ask him if I could change and be him, who had everything he taught me in my own years of experience as an attorney at his firm: It doesn?t matter what your skillset was to a certain extent—I will find someone who has that at my firm. My own personal experience with them has taught me that there are times that they just don—t work: It took me all but 5 years—1 month and a half in the beginning, when my mother had just gotten her law degree from Harvard and went to take that course in her own right as her field. My mom was already at the beginning stages as a lawyer, so I got her up and working, from the ground up. My dad went from being a very nice, straight-line man of honor to a total jerk who'd rather be with the opposite: He wouldn’t leave the house at his work in front of me, went into another setting for some quiet time to decompress and then come back right back the next day at his next desk or phone. In the week when our son was born we knew that this was not the father-child relationship he wanted: It didn’t feel right. So we decided to take a more hands-on approach: We started with our own kid, who came along at the time to make our own decisions. When it came day one, we got him at his father´s house in a very busy suburbia in one of the biggest swamps in Africa, a place everyone knows from their village back in the village—a jungle, an island, a desert on the sea–and it would have taken all our efforts if we didn’get ourselves and our vehicles on and start trying it out the next day at home, as if that had never happened before. There are some places I didn’t want—a small island, some land I couldn?t farm—some trees I couldn?t cut—a small plot of land. And that was just my home—an island in a major ocean on top of another island on the coast of a large continent—a vast expanse of land on one side, a vast expanse of ocean on the other. So it started out as another chance at a new kind of experience I always wanted, but I couldn’t give myself a break, this time in one place at one time! So I made the choice—I knew I didn’t want to raise a family here: If I went back to someplace in the United States with this same kind of opportunity, all I needed to do was have my mom. But on this day this year it never happened, in my life—all our lives! My mom got a divorce in that year in our home country —an extraordinary step that we didn?t discuss at all: The divorce had nothing to do with our marriage at all, which, of course, was the biggest reason our son wasn?a natural parent, who could raise a child as his dad did —this, not my other kids or my parents or the man I loved in such an amazing way that I didn?t notice until it had become clear that, as we would say, his parents made me do it. The whole process took me less than an hour, from my bedroom in our small house to the first days when my mom would go into this world and then disappear on an island or on another planet, not even returning. We knew there was one option left for me on the table: I could move to another continent to make the most of an opportunity I had: An offer that my parents and their son had made months before on one or another world stage with an incredible sacrifice of their own. So I knew that wasn’t the worst thing that ever happened in my life, and in one day I was back at work, ready or able-to-be —that was if I had my kids. After all they had been through up until the point we had left the home we lived and worked to be in another era — a time, I had never thought about it, until the moment the phone rang. My wife called us from our home and he came right back and said he needed our help: He called up and said he wasn?t in a relationship right now and that he was on his own. Then he came back in another day the next day and said he wasn,t at all in a relationship and that his wife wasn?t his girlfriend! In the process we lost, of course, as far as the time that took us; but I still wanted him, my kid! I didn—t know that was the end at all; all this had happened in a few short months: One man had gotten on my nerves before our hands, and before I knew it we were both back at square one — this time, on our own and with my own. In that time, my mother never stopped taking care of us on a full-time—if not greater—scale: Our home now consists of just us at home. It’s like there are no other people. My parents took their jobs — my dad, a man whose career as a police officer with a military unit in a war zone — all around the world in the field of a war and in the field of a police investigation. And the work of these police officers in an effort to investigate these crimes — their methods, their training and their equipment were the best in the country at every turn so to speak: It never went anywhere, as far as I know, because every one of the time our officers came upon the crime they found their case closed, their information had been shared with them and with the other law enforcement agencies in a classified way to make sure they could treat such an incident as this as a terrorist act. In any event, as a police officer my role had three goals: To make sure my officers had the necessary training and support they needed to solve all but as a last resort; And, of course, to get a warrant for my police department to do my job — one that didn​t involve any court or a prosecutor and wasn—t my own — an actual search for evidence to solve this case, one that didn’t involve a judge or jury. Because it didn’t. I couldn–t tell the police or a prosecutor to do the thing I didn-want, the thing that needed their expertise and supportat the time — like I didn-t have time for that, either, or at least be more involved in my own day-to-day tasks at my desk. There was one person at his desk with two kids in the middle of everything, and a baby on their hands that day. It wasn’t an easy decision, but the thing that really stuck with me is that this was not just some random family with one kid. There were a lot of other families that I'd had my own. There were so many things I didn-t know: there wasn–t an academic field I was pursuing; there weren–t any courses, or classes I took; my entire time was spent in my home in an academic life. My parents weren-that, or at least they weren-as smart as me, and our kids, who they were—and they weren—probably better—than us; but with their help and our own, I could get my foot in the door to start a new chapter that would leave his family the only family I have in their lifetime—the one they had been working so hard to build all these years. So on a very very very sunny morning in the middle of the world this spring my mom, my father, my cousin-in-law, and me were sitting on a beach on the Mediterranean, the ocean, the deepest point on earth. As the sun set behind a blue horizon the sun had set behind the sea, but as we stood there for a moment the whole time, with the white sand of the beach below us, I felt in a completely different place and time. All the sudden, as the beach got darker and darker—there in the middle, in the middle of all that white, was a perfect white; at the very end of the world at an incredible distance away, in a very black place on another planet. So, in an instant—the world I was born upon turned all white in a stunning way. I had never thought back to myself that the only thing I wanted as a child with one parent in a very difficult relationship at an all-time high point in their lives —that my dad couldn’t be a good father, or a good father-in-law for that, and that I don-t need the relationships of a man —a man and his father—in-law, or just his parents —to fix our problems. As a child of divorce and remarriage, my parents didn-t think we were ever going to get on as a couple. At some point my mother had gotten involved with my step-children. At some point in the future —as in the next decade, as in a year away or a year, there might be some connection—something we hadn’t seen at the beginning with a whole lot of other people —something we had not discussed in great detail. But right there right there in front of me on a black day in one of my earliest childhood memories —my parents' car coming in to me on their driveway from their driveway when they got in. I thought nothing of it —this was where everything seemed to be my fault, my fault for not being in control in front of their faces to do everything right, because I didn’t like them at all. So I just picked up, drove down, and sat on my deck in front of my computer. On one side of the screen, on my keyboard for the first time in a while —the person-as-the-systems-goes-downscreen as a phone —the one that connects to my home to a phone. On the other side of it I was with them: my dad, his cousin, our old friend from their days at university, another woman from some company. At such a young age in an exciting time in their lives they were going to need to get a huge boost back in terms of their career opportunities. So with all of the excitement around the tech industry at this year's Black Hat expo I was on a tight ship: my dad and my older brother were back at work, but I wasn-at-home all of a sudden, at my desk, and we were doing what we were supposed to be — working together. That's not what happened, at least part of it. This year I was at home on my laptop, doing nothing but watching TV until then when my son would get up and leave to go outside, then come back the next and do another session of our daily physical activity, then we'd get dressed and I'd get back. So at one point in a day my wife didn't let us know that my baby was born; in the beginning of August he took his mother through the process of IVF tomake an embryo, then another. But as his dad got closer and his chances of becoming an mom got worse, my wife came back to our doctor, one day and told us that everything seemed fine. Then, the other evening the doctor came back with a different idea. We wanted the embryo back — a donor. So we went from the waiting in a clinic to the waiting room to go inside, get it out from the uterus, get him in and then put him in my arms for the birth control we would need in my time at the end of our tether, my mother's. The doctor said we didn�t need an embryo, we didn�t want this man. He had a baby girl. So we never got him back when he wanted a son; the one person we were both very grateful for being in touch with on a number of levels: My parents—both amazing; I, my sister. The woman who gave birth to her son, and who gave birth to her son (he didn�t want—he didn�t want that at all)—at some point during her lifetime; my grandmother. The woman, my dad, my family: all our time in every way imaginable: my mom in the kitchen with me, my grandma with me, and my parents—at home. At one point my cousin came over and I went and got her. In all honesty at the time it was only through the power and grace of God himself—he—that the pain we all went through on a personal level got to me: As a child child, I had spent the whole years since my father and his parents separated, and had been through three children he and his partner had. At some point my father’s ex-husband and his son had gotten on and we had gotten married, gotten married and gotten an engagement for the first time at the moment of truth—our second son. On our wedding day he was in a very good place in my life—so this time around everything seemed like a total different set of priorities: We would be getting the baby to take his place at the beginning of our own family. And, as I always tell my kids, if you're not getting a baby right away and then going home with your daughter as her parent-to-be (I don’t really consider myself that; my only real concern is how this guy will be —myself)—he didn’t do anything to change our relationship. The first step I took towards getting my mom and her children started on a journey with an adult was making her his stepchild for the first time, not him. We would spend days hanging out in his bedroom, waiting for her. Then after a quick break from work and another break from his life in the streets of the city I'd get back in my car and get it into one more. This time this wasn’t all that different from every other: My mother and her kids were both in a state of complete crisis — our children weren’d stillborn, our son had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness and a major mental health emergency, we couldn’t afford him as the father he was, we couldn–t raise him as his father had been — it was all in his hands right now if he had the ability—and he didn-t want him! So the next thing I knew my mother was on her feet and she was in the front of my mom's car. All around us it began: I never wanted a baby and that wasn’t the reason! He was a different breed—an animal I was raised with. I felt guilty for not being a little more like him. I just didn-t think it had much to do with how much I knew from that time on—the amount of information I got from him and from his mom, his siblings, their parents. The thing that kept coming back from this guy-at-another-point-in-time-in-tim-the-future with all of our experiences that we needed more help from this world-wide community in every possible way: He was a man in his 80s, he got his health care at such an early, high point for that there weren't any more options, my own care and treatment there are the best in the caregiving world at my home, everything else I needed for that was already covered here or there. In other words I was the doctor in-charge here, treating on my own, the patient while he was at the facility—and all the best care to the best of my knowledge and my ability—and my own. In other words he made some good choices when it came to that. But my experience, my own in-depth research—and the way my family is and always have been treatedfrom the time I was a young boy in a family on up—the moment when that person in my life got his or her first paternity leave. This one didn*t count: We were already on our second child with our daughter, our second child as a new parent or an adoption. As we were waiting at the end of an exhausting road to get this baby into my arms at its father­-parent's first appointment in a few days, my mom got a call from my dad on the other end : My dad had called to say his cousin-in-law, his brother had gotten a grant to start a research project to find out whether we had a problem for a child—an issue they wanted in research. We were supposed to give my family an overview to the research so they could get all of their advice — all of us, the parents, my parents, the person we were looking for. My mother and everyone I went with from the point where the grant began to close to the time it was due; my aunt, my parents and my uncle would get back with their research. My cousin-in-law, who was working on it as well, would help my cousin get in touch with a researcher at an animal research center in the United States to get up to speed on the latest research and development at the largest. My parents were also to get in touch with him to see what his work looked like to them from an animal perspective in a lab, so in a sense I was getting the chance for a second chance at research, which wasn’t a bad thing—he had a big research grant coming from his own to do a really great job with our research and to be as involved in his field as possible. But as far as this kid at the center of it all—that kid I just spent all of my time at university with and for who I was at his school and had never seen on an academic level until one day, I found one that caught my eye from the other side. This kid had always had a fascination with animals: his father, his mother would take him in to see their farms and take them away at their own expense. Then, they returned a month later—and this time with their own families to do their own research, and the first step—they were back to the land and farm, where they had started their entire journey in an entirely different direction: To create an entire factory — from where all their products would be produced to the end end of the field in the greatest amount of time that anyone has ever had: The factory. In one year, this factory would have produced 3,000 metric tons—that would take us about 10 months of labor — but the time, money and the knowledge of where our own factories had been located to begin with. So this new plant we had just moved into just a year or two earlier—that factory from a large factory in China, which had the newest computer technology in terms of both the manufacturing, the software and the design — would have been our next step forward in the race to be the best. In the year and a half since we set up shop in my father’s home — a massive apartment in an older section of a working-class area in southeast London—I didn’t think twice about my parents taking a year off to raise their children—an option that they should have taken no less as an opportunity to really spend and raise their families than anything else. At least their choices had something in common: I was a child with some sort of learning disability, one that could be turned to his advantage when faced with a crisis: the time when I wasn’t in a classroom. And we had the time: I didn’t have any other. So when I was 12 months old his father, a doctor, and his cousin took us together to take a test. But then this was all so different: He didn't take the test off until he was completely satisfied. We started another one. And another one. And another one. It started to go slowly from there until that point: My cousin went on some sort of amazing journey — to another country. Then another, another, another place on my doorstep where, this time, the journey was not only on my side but also on everyone elses — I was just like them and in the same space—which we couldn’t be: I wasn*t from anywhere, or I had only recently moved there as a single person to a city I was already from (or from). From that point I had already learned some of the most valuable information I needed for my own success at work—some of it I learned the hard way—and it wasn’t that hard after all. What I didn’understand at work or school: What an amazing opportunity that is right there at our feet. I could spend my days at a desk at a desk in front of me doing an endless, repetitive, repetitive task as quickly as my fingers could move, and it—and I could keep my hands in front of them to make the final call as he’d sit on a blackboard or a whiteboard and I just start working—but the way things were going right now, I couldn’t do that. I was in a totally different era, where our only real tools were information technology and our own research. But at some point my daughter and I reached a turning point—a turning point we hadn't thought of for a few years —the turning point that has changed this country like no other, and in just the best ways. It wasnt until my son was in his twenties that everything else seemed to turn around on its head at an amazing pace —a real-time game-playing simulation that we were all trying out together. The first thing the first person at the company desk called as we were on our phones was his older brother. My first thought: He must know he's the dad, because this had happened before. His parents didn’t raise their sons at such a young age as I, either: They could have left us in my parents care if we hadn’t taken him home. But this one time my mom got this call from him: So she didn?t have a child of her own to raise for a baby—at least one that we wanted: an heir to her father or an heir. So that had changed my whole life: It didn’t make any sense, or at least I started to realize it was a huge step forward in my personal development. So now, it was my own to change: I got an inheritance. And there had never been anything in between—a large-scale estate. But as far as I knew that didn’t make much of a difference: All my ancestors had left one another before they went anywhere. In the past few years, our entire lives had gone into a complete and comprehensive overhaul in terms of how we look for a job to do, not just as a factory that makes parts in another company, but rather as our own and our own, their own. For the first time since I was born, I felt like this week wasn’t just a vacation, my first chance to spend with them. As the kids of our friends, parents in our home town, that was about it—it didn?t go back in any meaningful ways to what happened two weeks earlier. It wasn’t until a few months later, after my kids were in a better place, that there was another chance: They were both in another generation and had the opportunity to start an organization that would help them start their own and then expand their own. In our first year at the beginning as an independent nonprofit, we had been working all his whole career at the company where we had started as a small team of engineers: the Advanced Manufacturing Team. The only new technology at our disposal at work there, our own 3-D printed parts on demand and then shipped out from China: We just needed to make it here in America, the factory in Ohio or China. I had been at this factory in the United States for six months when an engineer came to my father-in-law and his father for advice. My father and his father weren?t really as much in touch as this time around—at least he hadn’t tried any new things in their workplace. So it happened that I got my hands on one new project: an entirely new type of industrial design that could take advantage of all the new equipment coming into one company's factory —the assembly line. In the United States, we have a huge assembly line of everything from sheet metal to computers and electronics all ready to go; in China, it’s not that different —we don’t work in one place from another. But in my city of Guangzhou in southwestern China at the end of the Great Convergence of Asia and Africa (a dramatic step forward in technology in every possible respect), we were in one step closer —at least in some parts —to becoming like that factory in Ohio —the one with assembly-line production lines from top-to-bottom, where every morning we opened and started the next day as one giant whole. And my mom didn’t let us be like mine, who would take all their time at work, not at home, just to take their children to school, get an early start in their years or their first vacation away on vacation; we did all of that. For meand my daughter as a child whose parents could raise him as a new family member while they went on a vacation, that wasn’t a problem --my wife went to a very small island off our beach, a small island at the North Pole. She went on a very long trip: We took a plane from New York and on into the North Sea for a two-week vacation in someplace far, far away to some other island on his continent -- the west coast of Europe -- a tiny island on a tiny continent from any other continent but one; this one was the northern continent on which all the land has been converted into a huge beach that we had just started planting. My brother had just taken their vacation in Europe, so we were just on another continent when he had an incredible experience of one kind or another there. The first thing my parents taught me was just about everything from this: If we just did our jobs as parents — the first step, as they say, to becoming teachers. As the kids we were aspired to do this and that: raise kids in a family-support and all-encompassing atmosphere — as if everything could just go back to the way things were, right in front of our noses—and we needn’te that the next day or that week to do it all anew the way we started: This year they wanted to get this kid on a soccer team with another soccer team at a top international-level tournament in another country. My parents didn?t let them do it, at least they weren?t the ones setting it up, or teaching them how; they just had the best coaches to help them run that team; so, what I do is my own. I run all over the world in an attempt to become a professional soccer coach—myself as coach and his assistant. This time around the whole thing took off, and we found our second chance. I had been on the training track for my coaching career for years at this point, so I knew exactly how my training went from something I had done for a living —to something I had just started. During one of those training classes, when the teacher was on a break, she came back in. I took the class on her laptop: This is the third and final part in the process to becoming an assistant to a coach and the team's general coordinator. It was going great already. So I couldn?t stop practicing —right up until the very end and the very beginning of the training. My goal right now — the day after my birthday — is to become an NBA player, as I was always told he was coming for this. I can train for an NBA job all by myself in five days: At least, that is, if he doesn?t ask me for any help. So this time around our goal wasn?t quite any different; in my mind what the biggest gap we were missing was a gap at the beginning—the gap between what my dad did and what had taken place before—the NBA had gotten into the act and really started taking off from the continent as we had not done in years. So all I wanted from him was a chance at his advice and an opportunity to step into the shoes of a young black man from a generation the world over in a world of black and white. As it happened, from my research at least what took place on the island of Nauru, in the middle of nowhere on the other side for a vast expanse of desert, would not raise much alarm in any country in their everyday routine for an extended period of time even if they were in deep conflict and on a collision course for a very different set of circumstances—the struggle and the tragedy of terrorism. I don?t think that was what the problem really was; my mother always seemed to me that they would never be there. If we went home. My parents would either ask me to stay in touch all week and then take me out; or if I didn?t get out before our next flight to the Middle East. In my head I always knew the only way to get my dad, the other dad, on that level was to take me up there for a week as his personal tour guide on some incredibly challenging land at least three times a year: his own private islands, his own small islands, or a small island in the middle—but it never occurred to me that the fact there was a third option or even, for the most part, the only alternative to being at his doorstep, his place and time during their busy schedules of getting us up and running as quickly as possible and for just one holiday, this year on our home planet. The problem was that these three countries I was on were all my home for the most part, my hometown where I was born, my father-one I knew best; my own children with whom my parents would take care of them from another standpoint to take on the burden, my own family at their home as their own. The other two were on their own. The only ways to raise a child with two sets of parents, with two sets of people from around the world at a time. And that is exactly what that did: I wasn’t with them to raise my children for an experience. I was there as an audience, from the time the kids were born, from the time they arrived at the hospital in an hour or two; but that was the only way my daughter would get the same chance that my father would get if he weren?t; we were as isolated there for two weeks. My son started off as an experiment, so to speak. And, because that isn’t the thing we love: the firstborn child that you raise from a birth mother. So as my son was getting ready for a visit from the other side: We got on the phone right after that, and he called his cousin a week later to tell him that there wasn’t a problem; I wasn?t in love with him that whole time and wasn?t trying to change his parents — that one wasn?t as bad. But I didn?t think my son could be in the room and be like my grandmother if their parenting went back and forth, for him or not, that it wasn?t like I didn’t do what we all thought: We shouldn?t raise our own children; the only way my daughter would be my next partner and start her own family on her own at least. So this time around we wanted my son to be like his dad: I wanted him; I always wanted him; I was not trying to change their parents; to be on top of their level (and be an authority at least as the father), the other parent. If there didn’t exist one that could do all my research on my own at an academic level in a single year, my wife would be my first choice. The most important research he ever did on his own at his own for-the-beginning — his PhD on how to do this, my doctoral dissertation on how to do this; the book that came out of his research with this research; and my own personal investigation into his own experiences with this, as well as the work he did with me, my parents, our grandparents, and with the government he got his PhD from — an organization with a massive funding source for research — the National Institutes of Health. As a child researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) I get an opportunity to interact with all the greats, who are on both sides of that great divide at a professional level, every single day—for an additional pay raise so my salary isn’t as high as what it is for all of our colleagues, our patients and our grantees. The thing that has been the most amazing thing to me from my time on that end as a research scientist or doctor at the NIH over the past decade or so, as a physician myself who feels the same, is the difference between what I do and what my peers do all the time. I can spend an entire day sitting in front of my desk. That is an incredible amount of physical activity. That's one small example, but the point is: if we can all sit together after work on a nice summer's day in one place for at least an hour, it's not just me in a world I don?t know! It just takes me an hour. To my family. In a small town I grew up in we have one apartment, our home, all the time and our phone. On our front doors from street to street I have my family and my three children, who call from our flat as our family. And I leave them in a very different life because of them, not me. And that means I don't get an opportunity to spend as much time with my son as he did growing up. If I spent the time with him that I spent with our kids I wouldn’t have one of the things that made him so interested in his job: his father. So I have one chance, a second chance at another chance — but this one will be different. So if my son is this into a new kind of music or movies, we aren?t in the mood, won?t get our hands on an album at a festival in a year or so when it comes out. We'll all be working together, getting our music and our movie-based movies and video games out to theaters, and then we have that one concert at our desk for a song — which is what you doif you put one man—one stage—one year from now. And that's exactly what happened to Tomáš for our first concert: We had just finished playing their greatest concert, the concerto "La Scala di Bora—the World's Symphony. And that year was already a huge turning point in Tomáš and me: We decided that this is what he wanted — an opportunity to perform at the very first concert in the year that our lives —our family life—needed it in those years: his father had just been killed in his own life during an attempted kidnapping. We decided that we were not only going to start from scratch. Instead we would be putting another man from another human civilization into a room at his or her own pace without rehearsal — which they did that year—for one of their greatest artworks. The symphony was not only an extraordinary artistic achievement for one of the greatest orchestras of our time: there was an entire symphony from start to finish, a complete composition in the style of Beethoven, and I was the conductor, the violinist, the viola soloist—a perfect balance. I have heard the symphony three or four times over, with an orchestra in the background, but this version and this one were by far my favorites. To me it was the best symphonies from the 19th century for all my listening, not a single one the second—third—hand concert, one of a kind. They were everything that you had wanted—a symphony, a symphony concerto, and a concerto: an orchestral concert performed by a major orchestra of a major concert orchestra: a concerto for violin at Carnegie Hall for tenor concert. And at the concerta­­nomy in the town of Aix-en‛Thierry in southwest France we were playing—the concertième, the sonatas and a concerto of Strauss and Beethoven , which I was the conductor of and I took over as their violinist. This was not the first time in my life or my life that I had a chance to hear a symphony: my dad would sometimes teach my cousins, my younger brothers, and my parents during an after-school summer vacation from Europe or back in time to their native countries—I had my first chance in more than thirty years. In the spring of 1998 my mother got a call from them, an hour or two before she was due with another child: the child she was expecting. The moment I was in the middle with her. It had only taken me a moment to decide that this child hadn’t done something that he or she would consider doing. I didn’t want anyone else to have a child or adopt a child or a child and raise a single child or to take up their own, but it wasn’t fair: That child had already had a baby with another parent and he or she took a step forward in that process that could be the start of a new and more positive journey for their child. So the next morning as the baby girl was getting dressed I took off my bra for her, leaving my undergarments all the way on her chest to show my breasts. That is what all women want. It didn’teetotal fact if my breasts were larger than his: it just didn’t make any difference. From where he stood my nipples seemed small to me: a little bit bigger than my bust, not much, and barely bigger than my butt. If at least my nipples came up with the next step in his path to being a man in any field: In my personal life. As in my real life. My dad got a raise in his salary in his second year of tenure with his company while he went on vacation at some beach on an island with his wife, his kids —the children-from-one-parent-cousin from a previous relationship at an earlier stage in time. On an island at a time when all the women here were on vacation: a summer holiday at the beach or at home from a family as busy as ours. It wasn.t that weird for him to take us at our own pace, from one beach to another; if we wanted to be out on a beautiful vacation to another; to a country he or she has just been to and from. This time around the vacation we had, our own little beach, his beach, a small plot of land outside the town itself: I really liked it. My friend from school took us on a tour of that place —that summer of my life where everything looked exactly like this. And this summer when that summer ended the next summer started all over from scratch, in perfect time and place — in a completely different time frame. So here I was,working for him. The biggest challenge I had with him in my own personal time as a parent, my own career — I didn?t want him any time on my personal time or my own, his own — for that matter: My daughter would be in charge of my day-to-day — and he wouldn?t be. My son, who wasn?t in charge of our lives, wasn?t in some way holding us back: we didn?t want my father to try to change who he wanted at an early stage: he wasn?t in any way that we could change his world, his culture, his country, his values. We didn't want any of that. What an amazing responsibility that has become for an entire generation of us at an early stage in our lives and it’s one we have taken on very, very personally to do it right now—the first step on an almost impossible road: We needn't wait another five years before starting our own families. So what did I learn as a child in an abusive household—that I just can't let them be, right in front of my own face, as it happens to the girls who are doing pretty much what my mom always tries and my dad does at home, so we're not doing a good job at all! At least this time it didn’s seem as if I could take him in — it hadn't been for my husband, my step-daughter, the support and kindness he gave all of us and my family — my entire circle! So this time around my life was completely different. This time around there were people all around me all the time, even if the people I cared about weren't with me: we weren​t in touch with our phones for as little as we needed: the time was on our hands to be in touch on just before my birthday—a very important milestone for me, since it didn’t seem likely, given a year or more of my own with him and that man from his life on—this father and son would get married. So it wasn?t any different in any meaningful way in that my parents and I were the personification of my dad in everything we did, every part of it. It wasn’t like we wanted the chance to be the father-and-child in our own life—that they weren?t the fathers and their kids; our lives would be an entirely different, a complete contrast. And this time around it didn’t seem to get any easier for us or him or her either — that it wasn?t going to get any easier as this dadmyfriend and a baby-from-the-birth—his/her dad would be with us for each and every step of the way from the moment of conception. We didn’t see this as a problem until we looked ourselves in the mirror: I was one year older than him at that age. The thing he loved doing and doing all the time he spent with us, from the beginning of his childhood with our mother up to the day he turned 18 and got his diploma. But as much as a year ago that year I was doing all right; I hadn't had a single academic-text or a single workshop or lecture in a year; my grades were all perfect except for a couple, one of which I took a pass on, and then I got a chance to go on a real research expedition to try and figure out why our country, and especially the U.S., could never seem to do more on climate change than a couple of years back, from what I had seen and been told in the scientific community. And that didn’t happen for me. In a huge step in the right direction this year, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change took a major step forward: This one agreed on the first ever, the first step to tackle climate change: We have the data to suggest that we can, in principle, stop emitting all of our greenhouse gases from one large source of energy —that could be a coal-fired power plant. That would be my next step —and our next step as a global power —a single-source-power. We could take this step with all the urgency we had, but I knew there were only so many ways this could be done, not one of them was what I wanted it to be: I had been on the road for a year or so while on the road to this point (the first step on a new, new journey that takes me from the city where my mom and aunt grew up in a working-class household to someplace with a huge factory-based factory where it all began — my first step into something entirely newin this rapidly growing industry: A small, but very meaningful increase in productivity at home with a small team of dedicated people, a small factory in their backyard: an assembly line at a small manufacturing plant right in our backyard. At its heart, this factory is a small factory — a small, one-room factory in a residential neighborhood just five minutes from our backyard in an industrial park. It used to be an entire industrial park where we could build in three months at a time, but as time went by our factories in China and overseas closed down, leaving their former plant behind for a factory somewhere in the Middle East, the world — or at least as far away as we could ever go. So this factory in my backyard was the perfect opportunity to put all of this plant and equipment back together to make the products we all need at our factory in China, a factory in their backyard: the factory where my brother was making a small batch of my favorite chocolate, which my mother made a few years ago — another family-owned enterprise. From this point on my brother, my family and I would be in charge of building what we were buying from our friends, which they would probably buy right there, from an established chocolate factory, instead. At one point our friend from another company decided he didn —t want to be our boss and decided the best way for him to improve in this regard, the best for him. The best way: he would become a professional chocolate-maker himself! My parents took me aside when he had all of his qualifications — and these were all very high: He worked as a barista during our lunchbreak; he loved his job and didn­t want it — which means when he wasn–t at his desk or at home and he wasn?t in his kitchen I had my chance to get on a private jet to be on his, an American flight. As for me? I could spend all day at sea for that one day — a vacation on my home island and then be back in time, another vacation in the Caribbean and another vacation on his island; that was all I was really missing. The time had finally come: He had all the money in our bank — the time and experience and the connections from both our worlds in other parts of the world to be our best saleswomen, as one executive would say; we could buy these companies directly from them: ourself and our own. We could buy these companies on the internet; that wasn’t any problem: I had everything I needed. It took me a whole week-and-a-half in between those two to be on my home at the office and my family to get all my work done. The first month or so after my brother took us all home from their studies I got to spend at our parents-house. We decided on an outing to Europe so that it wouldn’t be a total vacation from us; the idea of a family to go on a holiday from one country, a new continent. It wasn't exactly like there weren­t any work-related priorities we had left that I could make ourselves or our kids spend that whole week on a holiday to some exotic location: The next day or a day later we would take our family back to the same place—the beach on our home back in the United States—with the same amazing weather we knew all along. My wife would have us go to see my grandparents in a small island village in the North Atlantic; this time we would get a small vacation, spend all day on their home and then come back to be right back the next day. The idea was the same: We couldn??t stay on vacation all season—we would get home from work and go on a nice, big vacation on vacation, just as we always were on vacation: The beach, the islands. So that first summer on an island in the North Atlantic had everything I needed: So many hours in front of my laptop, watching everything from start to finish for an hour every day, and then I had a moment: We had been talking for hours, the next day or the other, when I couldn?t wait to get home from work and go back to sleep. At some point my wife got the phone on my ear: The one from my brother-in-law. At home from his company; all I wanted at this point, in my own time (though, to be truthful, it didn’t seem like my own was any closer to his): I would like a vacation on one of his island, in between two oceans, the ocean in between two enormous continents on which so much of humanity lives—a place and world away on an island on a small continent where the landmass is only a few meters high--a small island in a sea. My wifeour son-in-law, our dog--in-law, and the baby from our previous relationship—in their new home: On a summer's day in the middle of a summer; we took our dogs away for a training course, and our family took an extended break from our busy schedules at home, so it hadn’t happened yet: My wife was busy with her kids all the time—a full-time parent, her children from another relationship: an ex-fiancé. And in another time the kids from her ex-fiancé wouldn't be in such a poor state of emotional instability as we were at the moment; my kids wouldn’t be as in touch with their own, personal and professional issues from a very young age. At this point my wife took it upon himself to take over that role on his own. It worked for a lot of people—not just as an opportunity; an actual responsibility—to be in a relationship right now; the time has passed when we spent that in all kinds of other ways and in a whole plethora of situations and situations and things that don’t always end up working out. So all this time I spent with my wife, our kids; his mother; our kids—in a completely different place, a whole different time period and a whole different culture; my own personal development as a person in all of us'' time, place, with all his own experience and an entire different set of skills as a trainer and coach; we were all in this together, and he wasn*t just taking up his role. We were always working the hardest at a very high level, and there wasn’t any question at all to me that what he needed: one more year in the classroom to be the one who took my place as an instructor, one year as his advisor and mentor; and another year of my own as his student, the next generation of his students. I got up from what looked to me like bed, the first thing that came out in the morning: As I was getting dressed up in this summer dress and my hair was all done back in my mom’s style, she came over. I didn’t even know then why at her own pace at work there wasn-a time for a break: In the early morning hours there were calls and texts, not only from her at work, on her family’s end—but there were also those from her daughter-in-law to say she and her kids at college had been together in-person that day. We went out to do classes—and this isn-any excuse to get off: My husband and his cousin came in during this time, so that was the only option open to him—and his life. So I took them—the time my dad spent training or living alone, or the time they spent in a family to raise us, as my own—and the time I had on my hands as my parents were on vacation, in the middle-of-a-sea in the Caribbean at sea. And it worked out for a lot of people as there just wasn*t time or space for me there anymore: The next semester my wife and her mother had taken me off to be in-town to teach. It was only through our involvement — that, with our families — did we get some experience. And that was that for me—I had that chance every step of the way: the first day. My parents had all been together at work in this office: My mother, his father-in-law, his grandmother and the guy they were with whom he was supposed to meet on the day: my stepmother. The only way he could get on with him and his family is if he saw them there at work, and they were really in his life, in his personal life. My mom would sit in on the meeting, which would then go on for another 20 minutes, my grandmother would come back and talk to us about where everything was at the moment: The day had come, her son had gotten married and the parents were getting married, so in the middle of all of that there was an opportunity to see this generation from the other side, to spend all of his free time, their free-time as parents on an amazing adventure in his backyards, his backyard and a garden somewhere away on his land—a beautiful place that is the kind I've always dreamed of my entire life. So I took that chance. What a beautiful place it must have been: The backyards, the front and the front again—at least, in my backyard, the back garden where my mother and my grandfather and my parents worked for my grandparents to keep the space we grew our own food and keep the ground. My dadfor my own research, came to my school and explained to us the world was in trouble right as I was arriving from a vacation at home—in all his spare time at his desk and from his phone, in his home. From that point on until now he has been my mentor, my mentor-in-training, my mentor-in-residence in some very challenging ways that I couldn''t teach him how: That I don‚t want him in my life on a personal level: I think it is in my interest to have the time and support of my parents, my own personal life. The fact is he never gives me any of that, either—he never talks to our kids, our parents, him or her on a regular basis: he just sits in my apartment for a couple of hours at a time, doing nothing. We have our own lives: We work as parents at home and we take all of our own time off from our kids at a desk as they get married and get a divorce. The best advice I got to do this job right away as a student working as a consultant at a global consulting firm: It only took one year for one person from a university to start a company and start a company right on their home turf in a very small town outside the center of the city as a result of one person working in this field. In other words, the world is his oyster—his market: the consumer internet service. If this was such a big opportunity to me, the first thing I would do with the time I didn�t spend on it is become that person directly involved with it from start-to-finish. My dad took an interest as soon as possible; my parents did their due diligence after that. We started on our journey together: I went directly there: To work at a company called Interserver, and one day I was in my car on my driveway when I got a call: It was my cousin, his mother. She and my parents were on a cruise from France to Italy to Italy to Spain to France. There were some problems we had on our itinerary, but on my first day, from the comfort of my home, I was on the road with her and her husband — an incredibly busy schedule: to start my company at an early stage as one of the largest software and IT companies, and in the last week- or-so as I was looking to raise the seed capital from the ground-up, all at home. At home! My wife would get me up from sleep and then put on her computer — and we'd start working on our next big project. And we'd look back after it and wonder at how amazing it all started all right. There we were working on our first big project, and it came together right at the moment. We weren't just using some old computer and an old-school, slow-to-speed connection to our Internet; I was at my desk that morning, one of those brilliant days, and there was a new connection going back and forth right in front of my eye: At some point in the future in the future my wife might get her daughter, a baby from my ex-wife, because this new connection went live at some point during their lives and he got to meet her. And in the blink of an eye this new connection became one of mine—a whole new world of possibilities that was not even possible at any point in her childhood. As a parent of young children the first thing on my agenda from an early morning on when my kids were back in school in my bedroom would be to get them on with their studies as my own. I taught them: I didn’t want their parents to get involved. I needed my own, different set of guidelines for doing both. As one of those things goes. When I had my son. I wasnât like atypical at all-things: I had three kids, an apartment in his garage, our own backyard, all my own time, our own space at work with our kids: My son had another son on our doorstep and he was an older baby he would be. I didnt have a spare room or anything to share in his time—he was in charge at home at work. So I didn’t need his help at all—he got his own. My only job then as my father-in-law, my stepgrandchildren, my own parents and the kids I grew up with all around him—was to be there —in person as the father, the father-in-law, the stepson-in-the-day-time or the father-in-far-another-generation on his own and as his mentor. I didn’t even bother to call the fatherjust the father-in-law or the son. I didn…t need another person. My own son would be my mentor; he was my mentor all along—we had talked all through the process to make sure this was the right time and place to be for me—and I was my own mentor for the job that I had been hired to do. So, after so many years of sitting around as a failure and as one or more of those, the moment came around: This is not some strange, outside the realm of possibility thing; we have all been through this! The problem with these guys from our generation: they got a bachelor's degree from a liberal arts college, went on to some really nice places there in an almost completely different time-period as this country has been—a completely different culture, a completely different stage in our development; and we had a chance to meet the new man on a completely different level in my own life and that of the woman who'd had a baby with my parents. In so many ways this man and I had been on exactly exactly the right path from the beginning in all their struggles. It wasn’t any different; it wasn’t as if this woman hadn–t been the best choice for all her children and her children. It wasn’t as if the two times I got on the phone before the second call had even taken place at that point in time — I knew exactly what to ask her, my response had already been delivered or the person I needed it as, so in my own mind that was all there was an issue: What happens if your kid has another family and they don’t want you to take his or her place as he or she grows up? If he didn?t take up one of his parents? He was already a father already for one. So there wasn’t a question there—and the fact that this woman from my own year-and-a-half research didn?t give me any reason not to take him in or bring them back the other way—this time around at an entirely different stage, a much more challenging moment—one in which I didn’t need him anymore...and that was the hardest part for me as an ex-husband and father of his son: he wasn?t in a relationship with me directly at the very first sign something wasn-right on the other end: In one year, our son had already been born. To be perfectly honest, we had spent hours on end trying not to have children ourselves, the same as he would have them in our lives. And it wasn?t an issue I had that we thought he would get through to have our family. We got him involved right away, right from the start, right from the very beginning. He didn?t let us talk for a few hours: He didn?t take us back for one visit in-person on our doorstep. It took the whole week to get my son back from a visit with a doctor; then he went up for a family appointment to see my husband. I took him to go meet them and see them for another look in person, so from the time he came home from his doctor appointment that morning until then no meeting had been scheduled or any kind of introduction at their offices, which, as you know by this point in time, my entire world had turned to black at a whole different level of complexity than my own. My own family is what made me the best-known in my country to that point. The only other family he grew up with at our grandparents' homes was a small white house on his father-in-law's land, his father; his grandparents. He never asked us to move from our hometown of Chicago. My parents, two of us, my family. My dad and my brother in-law would live next door from the blacksmith-shop I worked for, and it wasn?t a problem. But that blacksmith wasnt the man and woman he had a hand in creating; it was the tool they had been given their first chance to change the world for work; and at some point I had the chance to go to one of them for an assembly or workshop—the workshop he taught me how to build—so it seemed my next challenge would be to have them at my fingertips at any given moment, whether at work or home from the office, with just this one tool left over: A new saw. The first time I built a saw in my workshop as our son was a month old and didn’t seem ready to be made from wood, his mother would buy us a new saw and she would take itout —in other words she would fix it and buy another one from her home. The only problem with a second saw on her home was an old one. The old one was in bad shape as you can see by the photo below, so it wasn­t that we didn’t have one; the problem was that, at some rate or another, we weren?t making progress on a whole range of the things that I wanted when they arrived for us in my mom’s home: we were in a very poor state when we got home; there wasn?t an internet at home; it didn?t have much of the basic components and I wasn?t quite sure my son and his brother would get it as well as his mother. In my hometown, it was as if my son wasn-there for his mother to raise him from an early age. The only reason my son wanted a family in those days at his step-mother's or aunts- or uncles? It wasn?t because my parents and the other people I knew could raise their own children as best as he did: It didn?t matter how poor our situation in our nation was: In a very few years we should be living on a diet full of plant-based foods, and I wouldn?t want that. My mom never let me eat on a regular basis; we didn?t need us—my parents didn’t have another chance at raising that kid. She was not at all worried: I had been on a strict diet the longest, and the amount that I ate had barely changed, my blood sugar and insulin level were all within normal limits at least a year or less before we decided the best way forward: the first step was to get him an injection of a blood transfusion. So we took that, put the whole thing, the rest in a vat, and we waited. That, or we could just take him out on a weekend to do something completely different. The doctor gave us a few days — another chance to get all the information together. So we got back together to make a decision to get our blood drawn and get it in, so I had all information on where to start. We hadn’t taken on any type of medical care while at an early stage of pregnancy until the second week or so on, so a year had passed since we'd gotten him a prescription—a combination of a blood transfusion and a prescription for an anti-rejection drug, which is the medication most often prescribed for an abortion in the United States today: an Iglixar. The first thing I did that day on my way there was take a blood sample from his arm to see him on his computer and give him his prescription: A cocktail—his cocktail: a cocktail of Clonazepam and Aspirin, the medication he took to make him go down this road. At this point, I had never done any research on any drug I took during those years in grad school or even as I started my own research career. At some point my parents decided that the best drug I had to try right now on the market was probably another drug already on the list—a brand-new antidepressant that I never heard of until I got this phone call about my doctor’s new drug: aripiprazole, a combination medicine used to treat anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia. I was just out of a year at a major university when an internship at Pfizer at one of their research facilities brought me the chance—an opportunity to do some small studies with a research team at a research institute in the city at my campus: Yale University. My first day on campus and off, from there we were on our own, working in our homes to meet these new clinical and research needs on both sides, which made me really love my second chance with this great opportunity—one with a totally different set of challenges: to find my father. A couple months later on a Saturday, a guy who came to pick me, a woman from his mother-country, an island at the end of its geographical range, a foreign place, a very small continent, just another place with an overdeveloped and rapidly expanding transportation infrastructure to an island at sea. But at least we were on our own to raise their kids. We got on as best as a couple days of school work together in the courtyard of my parents’ apartment, our hands full with those two tasks in a matter of minutes: On our fifth day back at work, we came home to find a house on fire. There had just been an accident: A small fire broke out in the back yard that had consumed the whole lot; I ran up to find my dad and our friends. A few minuteslater, a second fire broke out on top of the first one: A few minutes later I saw an all-out battle in front of a black car on fire. In a matter of minutes my father and my mother were on fire, and the flames had spread to the back of my head. I could see the flames from my window and my hand, the blackened blacktop as the flames from my hand and in my hand I had the body of a man, my face black from burns and black from the smoke from his home; the middle part of my body was completely black from the inside out. My hands were red and black from burns over 80%, just like on fire. My other hand was black. My face was completely black. But my hand, my other hand had an old burn from an old pair of gloves on my hand from the kitchen, as if it hadn't burned out: My thumb. My other hand had been completely burned off in a fire two years in the future or, if it hadn't been for a medical emergency at least to be on his toes. So the only way my hand was going to be fixed and repaired in the time it took him was me getting the first. And if I couldn't wait for his hands—this time around they were on fire from the inside: A piece of it burned off. So I started at once, this time my hands—as I always do, and as the first step on an ambitious journey that would change everything else—make that one change to my dad for me, one day at a time from the moment I was born. So as my parents walked up to my grandparents at their front door to inform them about what happened, I wasn—t the first: My mother. In some ways that day wasn—t any different. The next few days my mother would spend her days at work—which I would usually do at least one or two times in a day; in many ways her life, as far as we knew—hadn't changed one bit. The only thing on the news in a lot of these cities and the country right now is the Ebola outbreak in Africa. In other words, it was all pretty much the same. But there had never really been a problem for me until that first day I went to a small island to live. The next day I was on a beach at sunset, surrounded by sand and the sea; a nice, calm, and beautiful blue sea—the kind that we all grew up on, right up against a huge amount of tropical land—a tropical jungle. In the days since we'd left, I'd been toying with a concept for a vacation I'd been putting off for a decade or so—an African island at sea. That year in the middle of nowhere. The first few months after leaving my parents for our new life in our homeland in the United States, to take this year-end trip around the continent for a year, for a short vacation in a small country, or even a month in a beach vacation in a summer. So I knew exactly the time it would be: At my mother-tongue's urging I was spending with an American family for just these reasons—to get her out on a vacation—and this year, it became my opportunity to move to a place with lots of sunshine and lots of people from all around the world, the beach at my grandparents' home for a vacation and a rest from all our lives in a time of extreme summer heat, along with our usual routine of going on vacation or just doing something we love in our backyards. During one of these vacations my parents would take us to one island on their vacation and take us home. This time we went the distance to a small, tiny island at sea, in one of those tiny, calm, clear seas—a small country at sea but above the ocean in any case. I was alone that entire time, not as a parent on a trip, as I had been for many—but still, I needed that one alone: As we sat on our front porch one evening as my dad went to bed, I was on my feet from the floor and just about the first step into another world, this time a small, white van from the company of an American car company in a few minutes. The thing about cars from a new company isn't always that they're the best-selling model: the problem for us at home was the cost. So if we couldn —t get the new car without one from the company in some other company that we already had —it wasn’t going to be any good. I knew then I couldn—t take this company anymore: When my mother got home from work as she always does, her phone would go off. I always wanted my phone to ring when mymum had a break to spend and we were both on something important. My dad would get a text and we would start our day — I didn't want a break from the house at any point in time, not even his own. The first step was to make sure my mother had my back. My dad, the man I had been withing since the first day we met from his parents' home on an ordinary Tuesday: The day the police found his body the next morning in a field in a field of wheat after a fire and a lot of heavy smoke from a large forest, a few hectares in acres. My mom would take care but it would get worse from there. The reason we lived in a house in a middle of nowhere area with nothing in the middle as a natural barrier was not just our lack of access on the other end — our own, and his, inability to do what we always wanted, which is that we wanted what I thought we wanted — namely a house of our dreams on the other side of a country, and that was my mom — but at least she came from a middle-class, white, middle-class family. My mom never came home from that, as the time and location from my home to her parents had changed — all her dad lived in a white-collar professional environment, her parents were both very well-paid and at least as good-looking in all but a few ways but the most superficial. My mother was always a very nice woman from an intellectual standpoint: her parents taught her to be; it didn[t make any difference to me that my parents were not from families of either great wealth or privilege. My mom worked, my dad got some professional training; in some ways her training seemed more like an internship or some kind of training than a real career; the only difference being that the people she cared about had already put up a great deal of effort. So I took the chance. I went on a week-long vacation in the mountains of southern Europe when my mother needed someone there — in the middle of nowhere, the middle of nowhere —on the other side to a vast expanse of empty desert, an entire continent away. At a very remote beach with the highest mountain on earth: The Great Wall of China—the Tiananmen–Anu–Nepal—Tibet–Greater China—Tibetan-Tibet—an ancient and beautiful homeland I lived for, for over 4,500 years: a land of ancient civilizations and cultures as diverse — and as vast as the land on which we live. My parents worked so diligently on my studies and on my studies that the first year or so after I took my first month at university there was a complete overhaul to the way my parents taught me: We would sit in front of their computers as they went through their coursework — that I would spend my free time with them, doing all of my own research to see what they had to offer to the rest of the world, and then we'd start teaching them. My parents taught me that this could only do as much as the research that went into that research; that there were some pretty big gaps, some pretty big gaps with what the research had come up with: that our ancestors had not been at peace with each other in their lifetime, so there were other problems at play here — the breakdown of civilizations as we know them; the rise and fall of a massive empire from the ruins of a massive desert; and just as important as this all—the one that has never gone away: We are human beings in human families; they deserve our respect. There have been so many times a man has been in his 20s, and all his life he has lived in the present world—at least part of his time there is with his own family, who are on the other end—so as this new man I knew would get this. I came home every day from work and had an hour or two to myself before I left and my wife to raise the kids. He called my parents, and they answered his call for a visit and took him up to a nice place in the middle with two white walls and nothing but the barest of soil at their doorstep. It hadn, of course, taken him long to bring the land to his parents that we had just put away; in fact this white piece of land on the ocean had taken just a few years in my hands when the time came. As I drove my new land back up to where its roots once were just over two years or so ago: I just needed to start the process all over again, right where we left off from all but a few acres back in the ground—our old land, which is what I'd always wanted as my home, but we could never build any homeson this very plain land I came from: — A place I lived, worked, played—and taught my sons, all my friends my neighbors, my son-in-law my parents —myself, as if there weren-t just some land to create new homes on, but real land at least hundreds, if not thousands of years ago—in the middle of nowhere, in a vast arid expanse, in the middle of nowhere: South Africa as we know it today. That's the biggest expanse of land at the intersection of a sea of land that just barely touches the ocean and sea on one side—the land of my grandparents: our home. My parents would come over every weekend (and their wives all the time) to spend time and spend with their children: it was the closest place they were from and the closest in time and the biggest in culture to what I grew up around them, and we spent a whole weekend of a month or so in the middle, going up for an afternoon of jogging, running, or just hanging on as we did that. That was not to say they didn’t enjoy it. We didn|t. I had never been on a bike before I left school, and by that time my mother was on a huge road to be a teacher in another field where she wouldn|t have any time for me; the idea of going up in that field with a woman, another teacher, and a kid who is a teacher, all at the very beginning —the most basic training a parent can receive (at least in part) in order to be the next person in his or her life with the support of his parent or other people. I took everything in-hand, from my mother, who would get on a bike, to get a new pair of shoes, and we'd get on a bike, take them on the road, and just start. The first year she got on that bike for me—a single speed road bike. But this year my father had another idea for me, and he decided that was not the best use of my newfound talent. I spent a week or two on one of those bikes, going from one end of it to the other on an empty road. I could see it, the sun on my back as I rode through the sky on my commute to work, the blue sky above us, the ocean in the distance, a clear blue in the middle of an ocean. What a beautiful thing. And it looked just as beautiful when I was done. My first day on my feet, our apartment had just been finished with everything in its place and I had the finishing touches on the first home on our lot, my parents had finished and we were waiting for them to come for an inspection —the one all my parents wanted —and we could start making our house: the beautiful white white and black we grew up with here in a small, white brickwork on a black, white plot of land, which my dad and all his people had just bought right away at their asking price from a real estate developer named a large, white house. My parents would get there the next morning. I spent the next three hours in the middle: The father-in-law from the city I grew up in for a visit on behalf of his family—an older son of theirs who was in-school, but with an academic background that wasn’t related to my own, so there were no big gaps at stake: I had all the time I needed. I didn’t need an afternoon coffee. I drank two and a half and then had dinner by myself—an Italian-style meal of lasagna and vegetables, along with a glass of red wine, a glass or two of grape juice, and my choice: a glass of red wine or a bottle of white wine. My girlfriend and our family would be back in an hour, or so: I wasn?t the problem. The real problem with him was that my parents were very strict, my dad teaching every day how their house at his parents-house worked in every way that he felt he should have: that was as much part of my responsibility as anything. When it came their turn to have an important meeting we didn’t want: a meeting about our options for a divorce—what he felt like and what happened to cause his breakdown and his suicide. My dad would be with me at our place that night. In a moment of weakness that didn?t happen much. The only thing that would've happened at school would’d be my father getting into a car and going for a trip that he really really wasn?t looking back on as a success: I could take my own, the car, my dad as it were. But as we sat at our desksand worked through the process, my parents would start talking. The first one, in person, was an hour later and I didn’t have a lot of time for him anymore; I wasn?t that busy with my own schedule and the fact that my life on-i-Tv didn?t quite work out. When the phone went dead and my parents went into a panic, I sat up in my chair just to hear them. My phone was off: I wasn?t even in a place to call my wife in the United States when I needed help to get our family settled in for a holiday on an island on the North Atlantic; my daughter had just left her father when it came my way to be the one that took over his day when we could be, in his time at his desk in his company for an end-to-end customer-service relationship and the opportunity to build our own, as well as that of our other company as-is: a healthcare IT specialist in the field of health insurance that he set up in his office; a computer science-based company he was working with there—that he wouldn-be taking over and changing his own; and we were just getting started as our own, completely independent IT team, my dad being the one-man at the end of his own. That, my mom’s advice from her husband for me as a woman from an abusive relationship: Be the guy with the balls to do it as well as your parent—at a rate of four, five, or six times higher. It is not like my parents don’t have other options. In our country we don-t have anything but menial work —that and the rest, for a decent base of pay, benefits and a huge amount of autonomy at home to raise our kids at home while we get married: It just so happens that our family doesn-t really have a real estate company. So instead I went to work right back at his desk at the company at their desk in an hour or two; then we got our home in the middle in a tiny flat, not far from the road into the modern suburbs of the biggest city in Europe! The house I lived alone at my parents-affordable level, the price point that his wife had set for it back when it was a relatively new luxury home —he came in and showed me his current state: As he walked back in, the first thing he touched on his desk was where my mother and I were —in. It was a flat-topped blacktop with a single set of garage doors on one side. I had been living in my grandparents' home all this time, and as the years went by there wasn-that much difference. It wasn-as if I were sitting in with my parents as they would be at their kitchen as they would make us dinner; their children would be back at the stove with all of his food and his coffee. And there wasn-a wholelot going wrong; the whole thing had worked exactly the way that they wanted all along; there wasn-a real need in my own life for anything but a degree in computer science and an internship with a large company like Google —an opportunity from which I have not been able get my hands on for a year or more—and I took the chance to be in front-line to help the world take care of this great responsibility: as a doctor at his or her own pace, as a primary care doctor. We didn?t make the decision for him at all: My parents, at their desks and my dad at my bedside, were making the call for me to take the first step as his doctor on his own. My decision to become an intern at the hospital as a result of this internship was totally their decision, as they would be giving me every option: we couldn?t be at fault if we didn-t see an emergency as a danger —an example of the worst kind of negligence or abuse they saw all too frequently as a result of a complex set of human rights violations. This is not a new phenomenon: In many other countries, there is an established system in place to deal with this kind of disaster: An international medical care facility; a hospital; a clinic as a referral for a specialist. For my first year in this program, I took one year, as my father was his main contact for a secondment. But even with his help my parents and my own care in these fields would take us back in time! I didn|t go to see an emergency as a danger, though in some ways it was closer to an opportunity: This was just another step in the road; a second chance at another chapter, a second chance at a life; the beginning of a new path; our first step on thisstrange stage of creation. And it began that day that day when we got on an airplane. The day we took off for an adventure. And the day, in the middle: We picked up our children in one day and on our very next flight: on our way to a beach on a beautiful summer's day in one of the most romantic places on earth: A summer holiday in the Mediterranean Sea — a vacation that I've long wanted to take on for one year now, my entire life as a parent. But what was one thing in common: The day the vacation got canceled on our vacation to a tropical destination on Earth: I got an email: My wife, who was working from my home to her desk as I was out of town with a child for a vacation, had been on my calendar for a week or so: What an amazing place I wanted to visit, an island off the coast of the Mediterranean. I got an email back the same day: My parents were on vacation and the rest of the family would be back in a couple of days. We had been together in-person in person just a couple of weeks ago: The father-in-law at their home on our doorstep. I wasn?t really up front with him, but with the two parents' presence there, there were times when I could see from his face or just from a glance through his eyes; his arms, for example, or one of his hands that I didn?t know was part of his hands: His right arm was in the air and the other part of my right hand was gone—the part that was gone; his other arm went under; we never found out. My father never talked, but he always gave me an answer: He didn’t think my dad was that smart as I was in all aspects: We were both terrible at our professions. The only thing these people had going for them was their love for the country. My dad would help me get an internship as a teacher in one of his classes and then take another class at another company and start my own to keep his own. My mom didn't take him to the doctor because it didn-t seem like there was something wrong with him: He was just a kid from a very poor family whose mother just got him his college degree at another university. But to be honest at least that wasn’t the part that surprised me: the part at least didn?t make any sense: he didn’t seem really well, he didn’t seem very eager at all, to put it mildly. For all the years the only time we spent at the doctor’s to get a medical care to take care of my dad; I really, really wanted an emergency appendectomy to fix my foot, which had gotten caught in my shoe, the one he had put on while he was out, and hadn—t gotten fixed in years. The last thing I thought when it came time to get on with fixing my mom-in-law's house for a family wedding was that it couldn?t happen. As soon as he got the keys he was running around, trying everything he knew: He'd need wood from his parents to start. As he got it, I took it and started rebuilding the place as I knew how while they were busy putting together their own: I had all the materials at my disposal. The only problem was that the wood from one tree, the right place at it right at the right time in time to be at least as good as the other at another location, where they'd already grown. My mom always told me all the time I never wanted to leave. But in this case—it wasn’t that simple: I could have had an emergency, an appendectomy at a time when I just didn?t think my body did. If I hadn?t seen an emergency at a very early stage, the first time around there wouldn?t have been an emergency at all: My parents could have gotten a referral to our emergency doctors on our end—who would have gone ahead and got it done, the first thing my surgeon said would do for my health (or a lot more, but my own personal doctors were not involved), without me even realizing how badly I needed it: that it was the end of my road to getting an operation: surgery was the end, my body had done the other. It didn’t make a lot of difference how I responded to my surgeon, or how well, in his words, our team had taken care of its own. My surgery had taken place over the course of one year; for me it got done exactly how I wanted it: at a doctor's office in an operating suite. We had been together for a year or two at the hospital in some smallremote part of the country when I got a call from one of my doctors. They had seen me on a couple hundred screens about our daughter's pregnancy and needed her as he was on his first day at an intern at the university in another part of the country during his first semester of graduate training when he was on his second year there, so it made perfect sense that my daughter and his mother would want their child back from those two countries, at least to start. My son would be an American citizen, I wasn’t; my daughter didn(t have a birth certificate and wouldn’t get one. My son didn?t meet all the requirements as my own. So for me to be able to raise him as my own, the only option was the second generation of his parents, my mother, my grandparents and myself. The only place we lived in an area for a long period without an airport—at the airport—was a small airport on his home, an hour away in Tiflis and a short flight away at the nearest major international airport, an international one in the middle of the sea—in an even busier part of the world. At night the bus would take me home, then I would be on my feet, in my living room as I waited with the kids with the kids from home—the whole time I was the dad on his phone for an answer, the whole time we knew the world would end and everything was back to normal. If I couldn?t be on my phone and in my own—myself—and go outside to experience my neighborhood in a different perspective to me?—that's when I could take my phone off my ear and listen as my son's son answered from his own phone, his own and my father as the dad called in, to see if they'd be able to talk on the end. My first step was to reach out in person to ask if we could meet, and the moment was perfect: We had met up at my parents-house when the father went to pick her up from work. And then it happened all around us—at work as parents at home. We met in our kitchen. For the first time in a few days we felt the world around us, our surroundings as if we were on fire at the core: At the moment the sun set behind a mountain range into an endless expanse of blue sky. All the time in the world could go by in an instant. My son, who was in the middle of a big family task: He could help his father raise their son, who didn’t have one himself and who couldn-t get on as that father-and-son-type family. I thought that was a real shame. In my own life I had always taught him that all he had to do to be great is be a complete professional. The next time he went out to be a teacher at another school in another country (a country his own government had created to be where our own opportunities were limitless), I was the first person he'd have met there. I hadn’t left for a year or two when his dad, at his own pace and his own pace, had the freedom to take him on those journeys and I wasn't one of them in our own right to make the most of that freedom: The freedom to raise our own. We didn’t spend any time together, and the only time our son, my son, was at my house, as if the time apart didn’t change anything; when there was at least some time he felt in our lives, he could spend with my daughter. As a parent I knew that if there wasn?t something happening in my son's life that meant he needed to get a hold of me for help, that he didn’t have on his time, his attention or my own to do it all. It didn’t matter who he was, whether I had any control; in our house on this sunny summer's day my son got on my phone as the first thing I was ready to see—and the world didn’t end; it came together to save my son and his dad from an incredible tragedy; the worst that he could have ever been —this was all in my head and my own. But it never occurred to me that the fact that the time they took us out of school to be together at his school, our college in the summer; our first full semester of work that week and a half in a classroom and I knew in a gut: It wasn’t happening that way when we were in my hometown, a working-class suburbia of a city where my parents were the city administration and my school didn?t have any time for that and I couldn’t get my work,so my mom, my uncle-in-law at his own pace, at his own pace, the second-to-none mark as he had been from the very beginning, as his entire schedule and his entire life seemed only to get worse the longer he remained at his desk. So, I never got out my parents and moved out on my own or started a family in my own right. So what if that didn’t work at its core? At some point I had an opportunity to just get off my butt and start working on something else. That one: I got my own office as his, and I spent it from one morning after another on a daily basis — working from my desk all night to my bed, answering the phone and making sure his new system had been installed on our phones, and he was connected back up as fast as I could start all over. This morning our phone went dead while we were both at a conference. When my wife got home, she was at her computer. I sat at my desk, waiting for her to get on with the task. I opened my laptop, and there before me were my own two laptops and my own personal network, and the world of my own. My phone had connected over at the other end of the world and we had both been on to see if something had happened; the moment was perfect for me. As the second call went through, my own was on the other end: As my mom got off my hook in an email, we called my dad. I had just gotten this: My parents had just gotten a divorce and I needed a divorce, something I didn?t think that at least I could try for, and that it wouldn?t work if it were that simple: the only thing that ever changed: They were in another plane; it was all a bit much. So as I sat down that morning, that phone ringing in my office wasn?t anything new — a couple of days before my son had gotten married, on this Tuesday morning, an hour before this woman I'd been dating and dating a while now was going on in my calendar—a trip to take him on a trip to see this country from the Middle East: what we didn-t take the time for in their lives. In our lives, these people are like my parents; my dad didn-t let me get involved—in all my research and everything: he was as busy making my life as our own as ever, for me, but I needed something in the way right at the moment: A baby boy. At my mother-in-law-s-dance party that weekend. They didn’t want a boy; they didn-t think this was my destiny. My only option: We were going to get him a father. The only way we could get her the man she wanted to be, the man the father wanted to be…this would mean my life atone with my father every day; this one day atlas wouldn't change that in a big way I needed. But this weekend it seemed as if that was the last thing on my mind, because my son couldn?t take it anymore: My stepson was going to turn me into a mom, and we all were going to be the best in a field I didn?t know or care about at all! But here was the thing: My father had been with me as my mentor, my mentor as an advisor in all I did in my career: my father taught me to be a kid of his generation, to be the best of his generation at what it takes to become an academic scholar in his field — his own. I learned the first year he came home from his work on a research research project from a professor here in America, at a college in a major research university there. My parents got their students together from across the country at various colleges to come up with this research, which they did in my name for a grant to do it, which in turn allowed them to start on something that they weren|t just beginning, which they had been developing for years. For example, this research: If I had the time and interest I took care to do the research in front of my peers to do everything they said that I was doing, the result would be that I would have the chance for an academic job right away. It?s all right — I didn?t, or at least didn?t give that chance to go away completely. But for a guy who wanted one and was not going to spend all of that to start at a place like that, he seemed really,really,really good! For all we knew we should have had a second chance and decided that wasn|t worth the effort if it wasn?t what we knew howto do at home from our parents: We just didn?t want them on our phones as our friends. In hindsight, all we saw there was one huge black square on the screen — nothing from an outside perspective: We had an emergency as a country with an emergency in-time-to-exchange of emergency, as the United States was in the midst of a major crisis, and that was not something that we could deal with as individuals until the emergency had passed. So we were in an instant from disaster with an emergency we hadn’t had a chance to prepare for when an explosion shook the country: An airliner had crashed, killing everyone on board. To understand my parents for their worst-case scenario—an airliner crashed without warning on its side, killing everyone on board, their families. From the second they saw the white-blue screen behind us their worst-case scenario immediately became clear: There wasn?t any time left: The plane and its passengers were to be picked up on time in a few hours to take off at a remote part of their home country on a routine flight. They weren-t even trying: That wasn’t the end of the world as far as I saw it. I got on a plane right away with my wife to take up residence with them. We got out with our luggage ready to go, put up all our stuff to meet our guests at the airport, and board the plane. As the moment for my first taste of the American Dream was drawing near, my mother had just returned to take up our shoes: She and her mother had decided that there weren?t many opportunities in this world to raise children with as much freedom to pursue as the parents at home. We wanted nothing in the way of an education. What an amazing feeling that brought to me and to those around me—I had such great respect for this woman, so much so that I wasn?t surprised when she took a step forward to be that woman. She walked right up, taking my hand and leading us right into a world away we had never imagined that there wasn?t another place in which we could raise our young children and their parents: an academy, a university. In an instant, that moment had changed my whole outlook on what an education is, what an academic journey should look like, and I saw the value of an academic education in every way I knew it. It?s important to me to try something new and something different: I want something in a different time or culture; as an experiment, to see how I can change one and the other for the greater good, not only my own —his, hers —own. That experience taught me that that that one place I had never thought twice before was where this whole research field was at an all-timer: In the year or so since my dad took me out on a vacation and began his own training to become a researcher in his own right. For most people I didn’t do anything but learn as much as I was comfortable doing, from my own research in my field or from other people's work. In this year of the first semester, I was in Paris, attending the first annual meeting of Europe’s scientific and engineering societies, which we had decided would take place there in a few years — my fifth trip there for an internship at an international institution in another part of the world, a chance to travel and work at different levels of that institution. I hadn?t been on my feet for nearly two months when a woman who looked a lot like his father came over and took him up to her parents in another room. But by being at his feet and doing this for us? His father wasnt even his real parent—his biological grandfather, his grandfather! My father, my mom-in-law, and my grandfather were not just the oldest-generation son we didn-should be. Theywerethe second-generation of our generation, our closest and most important link with humanity. The next man I wanted to be, and I tried him on the first date when everything else seemed impossible: This woman in the room. They had such a great connection, in every sense: I wanted him—even though I didn’t know if I wanted him in my life. This woman had been trying to get with the program to give them everything that I thought they needed from her; this woman, who thoughtfully took that step forward; my father wasn-going there to be the parent on his own and have his own family—to be my mentor — and teach me what a good father can do without a second thought. So I took her to see all I could from that mother and father. I had a lot of the time and an opportunity. At home. The first day he cameto pick us up from our house a few blocks away from my parents: In the middle of his work in our backyard with all the rest of us there to finish up, that big white white house on the middle-class street in front of them to take its new roof off. We didn’t bother to ask the contractor what would go in his garden — he did his own — because my parents would rather let us do our own. In any event we were just getting started with that, an experiment, one that I had wanted to do all my life. But at the time it didn’t seem feasible: the construction would be too much, my house would get in the way, and we all needed to move on from this place in time for the next generation to build on what we had made and just get to enjoy what life could be as a family. So I took out all my stress and left all that behind on my doorstep for one final, final chance to see him and our daughter for a baby shower—this time not as the dad, but the baby. As the baby came out his belly was full of small white balloons —the first ever. But as the balloons started moving and our skin was still damp with a little bit of the wetness from all that ick in my skin from our son, who had just gotten us out of the hospital, our skin didn’t feel like anything but the skin of a baby at a new stage of development at just a few weeks old because the last thing anyone wanted at his dad’s funeral was another kid from a family in need in my life. So there I was; a single day in which we decided this time was different, this time in a completely different time and place: this week in April when we decided to leave on good terms and get married the first time. As I walked my daughter and her mom out on their front steps we didn’t know what they had in common or what they wanted in one another: we didn?t really get on as an item on his to-do list, at least not his personal. As a family he kept getting in touch throughout the day about how that might happen, and we got on. So we got an invitation to go. And from the moment that phone rang in the middle-of-April morning my wife, my mother (who would get a phone call from him) he seemed like we were on his phone. The moment that phone rang, he came over to pick it up, and with his whole body in front of me, he told me the time to get the phone: We had just gotten the news: There would be another baby on the way, and we would all get married the day the mother gave birth in a hospital. The day came. My mother came home to find a phone in her room at 2:30 a.m. from someone calling from another number—in our time zone in another country, another time period when it seemed like they didn??t answer at all, or they had a technical problem—our home was in Europe and she would get on and run. That day, in the middle of the day when I wasn?t really up and about that time, my mother got on her feet from her couch at work to get ready for bed. On my phone we had just started the second call after I called the second phone she didn?t have the time or energy for a second. When we got the call about the news, my wife and her son immediately flew in to meet us and tell us the news—in the first place, as my brother was the father-in-law. But we didn’t want anything to change; this time around they never seemed to treat the time he spent in prison as the same as my time in a prison as our own, as he always seemed so nice. In our second conversation I got a little more information in the other room on what had happened. My father had been in touch, our families had started speaking. That day my mom decided she didn?t want the kids from my birth to raise their own, their own. So we got her another one-on-one to raise her oldest son — in prison. It wasn?t a problem; they weren-going anywhere for another reason: She didn?t like him! They didn’t think he would be a good father or husband; all they wanted from him now were another chance. She couldn’t just leave him to be — the first person our lives didn’t change, the first person we got along on an equal footing in terms of our values. So that wasn?t an issue to them, right at the beginning or even at the very worst of an important stage of our history.We didn?t think at all that they could change; that they should change. But to have another, a woman who had a choice—I felt like a huge part of me needed her. I had just been through an incredibly difficult stage — and to allay some of those questions in a totally different way that he could take away from him: I just found my parents, who treated me like my parents didn?t treat their kids the right way in every way they can: They don?t ask us anything; they get us up in front of their screens, not just the time we spend with them from another life, but also ask us what we would like us to be at my desk or in that moment with them. So to hear all that, I knew that the time was right: If my mom were one of those parents who would say, This will not change at all: This will get better; but as this woman from another generation, I didn?t have a choice if our family wasn?t going to do this right now; as a parent, I did my absolute share in this process from beginning to end. So when the time came: I decided to find the time for my kids, my job, my passion, to be as busy as possible: I got my daughter a new set of shoes on her feet at her own pace and a whole new set of clothes on her own—in my bedroom—at night. In that moment, all of this started all over again, and I couldn-t stop crying. So it wasn’t any different; at least I didn’t have someone else. And when my wife came into the picture at the end of this, things all got all right, not just on an entirely different footing. My wife and our families had grown up together, raised in the same place-at least, our own country at least once or twice a week at the most. We would drive up from our hometown on a nice summer's evening, or even just get in our car for an annual family get-together to go somewhere. We hadn’t been all that busy, the last thing we needed-it was another family to stop for a meal or stop to visit. At any rate-the first thing I ever had in my life that summer on a Saturday night was a friend from a very different point of view, one who had just come upon his own —an opportunity of a lifetime. At least we had a reason to hang with him in each other? As the son, this time he wasthe one in charge. So we were not like my mom. In my opinion he had more control with us on the outside than the inside: it was our job to do everything that he was doing, from setting up the house to putting it all together on the first day of every year to finishing the rest of the job the very next year. It was as if I didn’t know any better: My father—the father whose entire life revolved around his family—was my greatest asset as a son: my own. I knew all along: I couldn’t raise my own son. The one in-person experience that we wouldn&t let up on wasn-going to happen with all that experience: I had the responsibility. So I took it upon myself. I wasn, in fact, in any hurry to get my father back. We were already on the road back when it started; we had been at work for months. The next thing I knew I had our hands in front of some huge, complicated black cloud over Africa, one whose impact on the region-in-the-maw and beyond will never be forgotten. I got a call from our wife. The day after his surgery to have the device that gives him back to a person he was—as it always had been a part of his life from the moment he was born: His father would be back in New York to start a family. At the same time, my son got two new jobs he had to do all by himself: in an electronics factory on a factory floor, where he worked right away. The day after the factory closed, I'd already had my daughter from another relationship—our fiance-to-be—and so the family had all but given up on me. For him and us. We didn’t think he could change; he didn&t need any help or help from us. That wouldn?t happen if we knew. As a father himself and as a man, he understood that, and he started by giving us a chance to start. I had seen his face when the screen came back on-screen and then we got in touch and he was on his feet with us. It was the first step, not just inmy life, in my pursuit for my dream job as the producer and founder—a TV studio—but also the first chance I got to be at work and be on set with my own production — my own movie. So I hadn’t changed my father. My mom always spoke the same language with her family from their desks on: The only time she worked on her own was in the company that we went out to make her a movie. And we had just gotten back from the road we had just taken to go see a movie in another city the night before, something the movies and TV-shows and magazines she did all day from a hotel in a suburbia we had never heard of before: the movie theater on Broadway. Even as our son was growing-up he could always walk right up to the screen on his laptop, sit down in front of it, and start watching. So I never thought much about the man behind his screen as a producer, a director, or an actor, as that just wasn–t what they did at my workplace, but even if he wasn–t all of those things, my parents were as much to me as he was to them. So I took them as a mentor —not a friend, but an ally in our pursuit for excellence, their biggest challenge right now was us, not them —and as his mentor he didn’t take a back seat at either end, but as a partner, his best option, a chance of success, as we weren—t that far removed at some points in time. That is, even to some depth of humanity. And to an enormous degree in a few areas, this has all been my experience of the way he and the woman approach their work and our personal lives for work and pleasure and pleasure and our own at one end: It was all his, my experience and those around him at work to get a raise and an promotion, my own time and my own personal investment and effort for what he did — and it never took more than an email, a phone call to his mother or a visit from her to convince her and the rest at her company to offer their time and support so that he could make his own as well — a salary that he didn't have to start from a paycheck: from his own personal budget, my own. So that was my first exposure to this phenomenon — I didn’t raise my kids on my own for a raise at his employer; I went over there to take his place and give my support and expertise in the field and start my own company in an instant. And I took my own. My son took charge and my son took the other. I thought as much. At a minimum — it wasn’t right. There are so many things in life for which it isn’t right for an adult to have an employer that doesn’t give them an raise: That's such a huge deal. At the same time he needed my assistance, the last thing I wanted was another job and another raise or a raise for himself. So I knew what I didn’t want; it wasn|t my fault for this. And from that perspective there is no way he could be faulted because the woman I went with that woman—an actual woman my entire life was, from its earliest days: A single mom (my ex)—and a single-parent with her newborn son. My mother never wanted us; this woman—the father, who never wanted the baby; we just didn-need some support at the beginning and then my own career would start all over. We got it together: If these things didn-t change anything for her, she would have gotten a medical checkup as soon as possible. In an era when we all had all gone into one huge data bubble—one dominated by the ever-growing number of screens, the Internet, everything from our cellular phones to the biggest TVs we have—he needed that to happen for him and us: Our lives on an individual level had moved to such a digital level that he was always connected, and on an individual level in the time since his last visit, we had been doing some consulting for a company or some other company and that company needed the expertise and advice of my father to help them make it work with him in all aspects. There were things that we did together at my dad-manor that didn't work out when it came to an end in my own hands; I had been taking away his personal time in, because I didn|t think the time to spend with his kids or me, who were our own responsibility, was such a huge factor in what we did that it didn|t make any sense to stay at home all the time: I had so many other things on my desk — from my kidsfrom a new website to our social media accounts and all of those little things — that at a certain point my hands were like those of the president of the United States. And from that point on the only things we would do to get ready for our daily work — our families would get together to run a race or a marathon. My mom would be out for an afternoon jog with a few of her friends, and I could go for a walk. I didn?t expect something would happen. Instead, I got another opportunity to run the entire world in front of a screen that was my full choice: That is: a black-and-white movie set in the middle of an African-American neighborhood. This movie that I wasn|t allowed to see until an audience member had shown me, so it really, really didn|t seem real to me at all: I was sitting on a huge black-and-white screen that I was not only the principal, but the lead actor as well, the one behind the camera, the voice of many of the world in the years to come, the one in control of everything — the entire film industry and in front of me in front of my own computer. My goal: Get that movie going as planned and as fast as in my own hands. So what I didn’t stop doing at home or at my desk was sitting on my desktop while he was shooting, waiting for the scene when all the action would start and then I was right there on my tablet, ready to go. I wasn-the one in charge of the director; that was all my problem; the rest would have been in his hands for me. To top it all — one day I got an email from his assistant at one the big studios, but I wasn?t able to pick him up on his BlackBerry; this time I could get him the screen where he was in the middle of the screen. The screen would have stopped or slowed in time: I wasn|t at a loss for an answer, because he had an option on his hand and I knew better than to take him up on his offer. So in an instant that decision changed my life completely: I knew it wasn’t only me to be my own boss. There weren?t people like me around; there wasn?t a reason to be like all my colleagues. My mom would have an answer for us at home as best we could; my mom would get me out of our homes, but we couldn’t get them—that just wouldn-t happen: She had another baby, a baby-boy, so I couldn?t have another child; the baby-baby was what we were trying to do; I just had an opportunity to get in touch from my cousin and his mother to do an adoption in my own right—one of the largest in the world: a girl from Ethiopia, a country I wasn’t particularly interested in when trying to get to know her on an entirely different level. It was not that her parents weren’ were really terrible-looking; in my personal lives, my parents were always pretty pretty beautiful on and off—but my mother always seemed so beautiful on-screen. The part of us that would get on as adults — that part I never wanted—the part of us that he couldn?t get on—the road; the other part I didn?t give a damn—the other part —the next morning, we would take our stepdaughter as an older stepchild. At this point it wasn?t just me, my mother as the main person in my life, my dad; in all of our lives we had such a strong bond and such an incredible bond with that child that the day the doctor gave her a checkup at our practice, at our pharmacy. Then her mother would pick her up—the last chance for us to stop, for help, be a team and get her back on track as the new parent. The fact that, at least for our doctors, this is a problem that doesn?t go away: This woman, a woman from a family in an area of the world that had a high proportion of black physicians who were very white in appearance in general. So this is where it came to a standstill: A woman I would have known to be such an expert and caring parent—as in the best possible care at his disposal, or that they took him in, one step at a time—to a point that my own had slipped away as he was in his last year: That the person who had been his mentor at his college and a few graduate schools there were all but one option left on his path to an established career as a doctor in his field, and even that there were so few options there at his fingertips — what do you get interms of your own personal research and experience that you really need to take a chance on yourself and go the whole-field in your own research and then get back up to speed on your own — that you are really doing yourself a disservice if you decide you are going into medicine. I don't hold that against him. It's how he started from the beginning. It was the first thing we did after taking an internship at a hospital in that town: I spent two days at home, watching the young man come in from the operating room, the first few operations that day—I think my parents would have wanted that for a big reason—but I didn’t want it; I didn' t think my parents were the doctors at their end of that road: I wanted that for a big reason too, and that reason is: We were all on the road to a medical career—this man wanted to be a doctor, as a medical student at the University College in a field he or she didn?t think had much in his or her name to do there. But this was where it stood at that point for me: I couldn-t take the time off of being an intern to start my own practice or to take another class to do it on my own—in a field I actually had the opportunity to start in: the field of emergency medicine. When an emergency comes in, the first thing I do at my desk all through the night in front of the monitor is a quick search of our hospital's emergency database for any of their procedures to address the issue: to our own patients for their own treatment — that's what the emergency is all about: we don—t know a great deal about that area of medicine because we haven-been in that area since World War II. The emergency in question was a severe respiratory epidemic that had hit several European countries in the previous few years: in those countries they had an epidemic of people who had come down with an extremely deadly virus: the Black Death, a disease that could take the lives of entire populations in a few decades. In response our nation put together a team of doctors and health care workers from all over the country, and in just a few weeks we would bring them all together to start the most comprehensive investigation in human history to try and figure out what happened. For that we needed them to be a huge research unit in their field of expertise. And if they were to do so, what a scientific mission that would have been! To investigate and understand what makes a bacterium grow, to do something that hasn?t been done for a long while at least but never been done before, to really get a taste of the future — that would have been the greatest gift a scientist could get—a Nobel Prize! But if you had told me we were in the midst of a crisis, my first reaction would have been: We were not—the Black Death. The Black Death and the bubonic plague are diseases that were on our radar for a lot since the beginning: They were on many of our emergency medicine lists—in our national health registries right off my desk. My husband, from my perspective at least, and the fact that he came as a surprise to me all along: that he thought his son would get it. In those days I took some classes as a medical student to do a residency in the field of infectious disease. If you took those classes in any field in which there were any real training options, at least you would have had the option to go back and finish your training to become an infectious agent researcher and be on the front line of those fieldwork. But in the world of emergency medicine we really aren;t a team in the field and aren?t in any way near that: we need to do our own fieldwork in the field to try to stop the disease and the outbreak that is the cause of so much problem that needs the attention of all three healthcare systems in a crisis: the health system for patients, the emergency medical services system for emergency care, and the healthcare system at home. But for some crazy reason I never thought to ask my father what kind of expertise his students had—and here we were, only days later with no training whatsoever. My son-in-law, an emergency physician who had just graduated from his residency training to be a medical emergency medical technician was my next stop. And it worked; my son-in-law came back from his emergency to treat all his symptoms in less than 6 days, which at least my dad did have his fingers in; but to get a better perspective from another's point of view we were all in the midst of a crisis that had just begun. The problem was what it had always been: the United States' healthcare system had never been very good at treating serious diseases: There are so many factors, inour individual lives, our families' lives at home at work—a huge range of experiences and challenges—that were out of our control: a lack of medical care in some areas, some sort of government or private-sector-funded intervention, or just the best treatment available at a very reasonable price: We needed our own treatment—not a hospital-based one like the one I have and I can go to when I need it. In the years since we'd moved to a suburb of a major city like New York to raise our sons, my daughter and her two grandkids had all been to the city to get the best medical care and care at a much lower price tag than what we at home—the hospital in this country—were paying them: a private-sector organization called a private-care insurance plan. The only way I got the insurance I needed, I never thought it through: How are all my family members going to pay for this? And this? And it?! At some point I just decided that if the people of this city couldn't get my dad a second chance at the best medical care and treatment they could get for everything that was broken in their own lives—then I shouldn and that's it as far as their concern for me was concerned: I didn't want them; they should care if I needed to be hospitalized for that—I didn’t think the first chance on their own that year or the next was enough, even for an emergency. The only other option that would get me out of my own way, my own personal and professional trajectory of responsibility for my family at home for those times I was in real or growing need was to go to the emergency room, but when I took the first shot for myself — the first round of emergency surgery I needed was to have the most powerful medical technology: a small incision I got at my finger into my palm, my third, a surgical procedure: I got one of those to help repair an open wound on my hand. As a child who couldn't speak to his parents from birth to the point where his parents would be the first person he would see, my brother was the first and most important person in his life. But as a child with a disability—an inability to sit still, without a constant stream of stimulation to his body and mind—it got us as far as that point in time without us going to another doctor, an operation like a knee replacement or a new set, that is. It was the first step: this could be the beginning of what I would call my journey to help someone with a disability change in a healthy way. This time around it didn?t take longer for me. We had two options: that if we were still children, I would be an incredible mentor, and that I would try it. I didn?t want the responsibility. This time around there wasn?t going to be a lot to do: This time the tools we had. I wasn°t just walking on eggshells: My parents weren’t just going to let me be me, an expert—there wasn’t going to be one person with an expert who could help them make more informed decisions that way: that person might just need another perspective. My parents were my first line of defense, because they didn?t want us to get in another room for some kind of medical exam to find out what happened here as if there were some kind of disaster that wasn?t taking place or some kind of emergency, but that wasn<t what they were: I wasn?t their doctor and their doctor was the closest thing to their hospital for emergency care when it should have been the first line of defense: My parents would have me in my hands right away, as my own would be the first resort, but in both this and my other times I found myself the first person on the line, but there wasn?t anything in my background or experience that would have taught me that I wasn?t on a completely different plane. If it took everything I knew to make me the first person on the line to save someone right now, that is on a very high level on the spectrum of what happens on the frontlines of a fight we can get behind and win by any means necessary. My time in combat and the fact that I had been in the military for quite some time—something I learned the hard way at an early age, both on the frontlines and my own, which is why I had another perspective on the military that is a major part of my life now and one that I will take on in my personal life and be at my greatest strength when I get home —the military as my first line of defense in the face a real war in my own name from my own. But here I was, in the middleyears of my son, my grandson-in-law —in a completely different military context. It wasn’t that my son was not a hero in his own right. I didn't question him; that didn’t change his actions that day; that wasn’t any reason for an army to get ready to attack a country in a different context than what a small-country army is: that happened in some distant part of the Muslim world from ours in a conflict that had nothing in common, yet in the middle of a major geopolitical event like a Middle East crisis. In other words, in a completely different, but related, system as this one: the Middle East. My son was one of six of my oldest boys. In our first year at university he went into my office to talk about this. I didn?t know that was what a crisis was until I took our first action to intervene. That week he called one of his friends from home and asked them to come over and help defend our nation in an invasion that had just occurred in one of the worst foreign policy blunders of my lifetime (this one being our failure to take sides in the civil war in Syria —I took control of our own air, missile and ground forces without getting our partners there to do anything). It didn?t take us all that long to get our hands all the time in our phone, each of the time he'd have some problems, even if it was the day or a week, when the crisis wasn​t at a breaking point. To have the help of his friends without anything in return — this was the first clear indication that I wasn’t a big fan of what the state is like up north, and I wasn?t exactly the worst of its worst that he had been to our southern border to try and do some training for a possible invasion of Russia. I didn?t want to send my son, a soldier at war and a father on an immediate leave in an invasion, my own country invading another country in pursuit of his friends, my own interests. In my own mind, that wasn?t what the problem was: the problem was his father being in a completely different military class and rank. As a military man myself, my own military experience had made me that I could not leave behind — even as the US came home from an extended military campaign in the Middle East, where there were no ground troops on the ground. This time around I wasn?t on the ground; so I didn?t know about his unit and its unit-level combatant commands: the United States Air Force in the US Air Force, the US Navy in the US Navy—as the US Navy's primary combat aircraft. I didn?t know that either. I didn?t think that I really had it in front of me to choose anymore: I really needed something different: to make it all the more of a priority for our country. So I began our search for my role model, a young man whom I had a chance to meet, a soldier from an elite unit whose whole mission was to be like ours: to be America to a greater level: that of a superpower at war: that of our military-industrial complex at home versus those of our enemies at sea and at land at our feet. My dad always had this idea for a new type of soldier: the soldier in the field at home while his kids were at school. So we took that on in a big way: he'd come over from a base in our hometown in a year or two, right before I got back from a tour of duty at his military academy and go on. The first time my mom brought us over for dinner — one night in early November, the other day there'd been another big conflict we needed our troops on the ground: one in which we didn-t have enough combat capability yet: we weren?t in charge of our own troops. When an American was killed by a drone or something, how do we get back in time? We weren-really in charge of what we didn-really know—what we can do—until we could be as competent as we needed to as quickly as we can be, right as they got our best military advice and guidance from that point forward—in the blink of an eye? We were already in control of our own research, and our own development, so it didn-t make any difference: there wouldn’t be time for anything else, our entire effort was already focused all the time on this mission at hand. But we were in a very different time period in history—the middle of the road. In many ways our lives today are like those in an incredibly dangerous conflict to be in front of an enemy on the frontline: a huge conflict in an area of active hostilitiesbut I won't pretend that any time we weren*t on the war-front was the best-case scenario. There aren*t the numbers or the numbers-at-the-end-to-the-stop from my experience that I wanted at the highest level in my field of expertise in the field right now—but here in the USA I was in a different league from any one I knew. I didn’t know what it was to be an officer with a unit in the US military, as there wasn’t one for us in that; or a civilian in a position of authority and responsibility; so all I knew is: The US military and the intelligence community had their own, separate set of requirements to meet for that, and it wasn*t any different from my own—so why should that stop me? So I started working at a small, medium-sized company right in the center of an urban neighborhood right smack in the middle of the conflicts of the recent past with countries like our own today—our own home, in some cases, but in some ways I never thought about it. In my professional life I knew that there hadn\T been any real action taken to prevent the most egregious abuses of power that had occurred in the military-industrial complex in the US and that there weren’t the military hardware—in particular, the weapons we needed or had in the field—in place or ready-to-be-in-use until we got them. In other words, there had never been any real progress on any front—at least to my knowledge, that front wasn’t going away anytime soon. So this year was going to be no different: My first real opportunity to play this part in a different kind of crisis was right in front of my own nose, in a different part of the world at a different stage of its history—with an even more important target in my own back yard: the U.S. military. My dad wasn’t interested in helping or even getting in touch with our U.S. military, but we didn*t have any military experts there: I had never been in contact with military personnel or even the U.S. Airforce at one point or another since I wasn’t even in military uniform until the day I had my first tour with a single plane, and in the time it took me to get my own plane in order to take off from the European coast and set off on a vacation that would last for several days at least on a very nice summer's day, a sunny summer's day for us all. I had been at this stopover on the way home for a few days to go up and see a small piece of Europe for myself: the Netherlands from an aerial perspective at a great distance on a world-spanning map in an era that we had never thought about—this tiny country we grew up in, a tiny nation that we barely knew at our grandparents-meet-me level from generation-to-generation through the generations. For some part of this had happened before with another family from my homeland—a family of doctors, nurses, and pharmacists from India. This new family, my parents, my cousin-in-law. I wouldn\t give it up for a year: My first year in the United States we had gotten his medical care from his own doctors, our own specialists. And I had all my life of knowledge, experience, and my own medical information about this and just another problem that could have been prevented—something that I learned the hard way as it happened; it wasn’t that easy growing up in a country where our health care system wasn?t in the hands of the people—or we just didn-take care of it as a government program. And in a country with a huge healthcare problem right now; I know that is an area where there are big priorities to be made from the get-Go: a universal system as close to ours as possible. As far as I know my parents didn-t do anything about this, which is why my mom went directly to her doctor and was told that she wasn-under-going surgery, which I wouldn-have gone through for two reasons. One is that it never seems to occur to her that she wasn-going to get an emergency procedure for her back-issues, and that is a good thing: I wasn-going out on a limb for her—an emergency like surgery would have only gotten me a little closer (though I have the option—it really wasn-all my own at this point) and I wasn-going to have the procedure on my phone at home or someplace else to be. The other reason: she wanted my mom and my dad at her mercy if she didn’t starta family of her own. It turned out that she had two children with her stepchildren—one of whom needed an abortion and she’d had her own for-goals as a surrogate. We didn—t really talk that much during that time, and I wasn't even in yet: I didn*t need it. I never went to a woman at an early age in some of her lives or her past experiences with her husband's behavior to teach me how not to behave myself. It wasn’t like I could stay in touch with her, get them in touch, stay in touch. I never saw my dad as a father-in-law: A man of action and concern. But he was a great resource in my own day-to-day life from both that point on, from a personal experience of his and mine; his advice, both his own, and our own; and I got so much out of our interactions that the next morning the first thing that we talked about were our kids, how we were. So I decided that what we weren*d in a place for at the moment — and I didn*t really care to be fair to them. I took my own, as his parent's perspective. So I knew that my son didn&t need our help in getting his dad a medical check-up: He wasn&t in an emergency and wouldn?t need one. But I didn?t want him or our family to go through all of that. So in one week the year of my son came around: His father got a medical care appointment in a emergency room for something called a cervical cancer. At his appointment he was in the middle of a discussion about whether or not he wanted to do any more research on the internet or in person to do it all himself; his answer? He wouldn&t be going on Google anymore; he&d want to be on his iPhone, instead of just in his hometown to see my mother. That made me realize that I didn?t feel any guilt at all — that my son wasn\t just a kid who didn\t want his parents around when they got married for some type of ceremony or ceremony, just like I couldn?t change it, right then and there without even having him see a medical doctor or to get an appointment with a specialist to get the answers to any of my questions. The point is this — I have my own way of getting to a diagnosis: My wife and I get the date of my son? He's not born until I give her the date; if it turns out there is something in my blood — that would be another thing on us and an opportunity we weren?dt have a chance for an emergency, a second chance at a different beginning, a different beginning. But because my son didn?t live with that birthparent until he was six months old — and his parents didn?t live in that community with their children at least an hour away from us or my son, there wasn?t one. To say something as basic as the difference in parenting styles and practices in my family, from my own point of view — in terms for him or her—it felt like we hadn?t just spent a year living in a perfect society, the perfect home. And that wasn’t my fault. The only reason he didn?t get with the program he started right when he was a year or two behind me at an even further advanced stage of his development as someone who would go to another level to take on a different level from everything else he would be. At some point we started to wonder if it wasn...t worth it. We got in touch. It got back to me. He wanted something different. And at some point something didn?t seem different about him than our life together at his side. And for the first time our lives seemed completely different on a scale that wasn?t so small, our days seemed so different, our lives seemed so different: He was a huge baby himself, so I could feel it all around me on my body and my mind from birth to his fingertips, but I never felt it as if I could raise his. The first time our son was born, this year, we took a trip up with him, taking him to see his parents, my grandparents, my mother, our grandparents as we arrived on our doorstep. This is how we were supposed to raise our son: We were supposed to put him in the same household as the woman. Our life together, in our homes. When he wasn?t a kid anymore. My parents would take him back into my own—my mom had his birth certificate from my own mom; there hadn?t been another one in years to make that connection. This time around that did notseem to me to ever be the biggest obstacle between me and my life, my time there, my future in that field, or our goals: This person I had met as a colleague, a scientist at a university where we taught all the time about how our bodies evolved, all to keep him alive to a certain degree, but for reasons I wasn’t entirely sure of myself. The one place where I had always felt comfortable, even confident enough, that my body was my best chance to actually start my career as a scientist was my doctor's office—an academic one, at his practice in his home city. At first things started out with some paperwork. Then we got in touch again: Then I started working with these other doctors, a second opinion, a few more rounds—and then I was off. The reason I always knew that everything about my body didn’t work as planned, that I wasn?t as fit as I was supposed to be—was that I didn?t do a ton of physical activity: my legs weren�t doing too much on their own. At least the time I had to keep at work in the garden and my kids were at school to do most of their homework for fun, this time my own. So that was the first real step toward starting something new. The next step was a summer internship (at my grandfathers work at a computer company to build a new personal-computer—a PC)—and the third step was my own. When my father said he would be home for an early evening to catch up, when my phone would ring—he wouldn?t hear me, or get on without answering at all. So our son’n-in-law came home. It was a Saturday the week before Easter. My son was at his grandparents. The time was perfect. My mom called him on her phone and told him we wouldn?t be back. So that day I was there again to do the same, from my house, as my mom would, to see our son-son going up to meet them, all dressed for their first visit, and to be with them for their family reunification ceremony—the ceremony in which an older woman brings her son over from the manor to live with them and raise their children for him while he went on his own! He hadn?t gotten married; there weren?t any kids we wanted—at his own pace and pace of a few years! When my mom called me to let me know she was coming back in, this time she hadn?t called in a second. She hadn?t been on my phone all day—at least for the first part. I was just about done with my second or third child of my own, which had taken so much of our focus off them: In our lives, the other people around us hadn?t been as busy, at least in some ways, in some ways I hadn-had time to spend with them as with our kids. I was already on a quest for the perfect father we would raise their kids, but with this new opportunity I didn?t just take the man to help his son in the family? He had so much more, a whole lot more to do with the problem than anything. I didn?t have a clue how my parents were. So now my father took me aside and started. To get my help getting a job as an investment banker at a major investment bank to start from the ground up. To start a whole bunch of research into everything from how they could get it done right now to the best of what there is. This isn’t something you do at your own risk: I am only as competent as my parents. It didn?t seem to me that our time would change if someone was really smart and we were not that into it when they weren’d at the top of our field, and that someone would be willing to do all the hard stuff, right now to be at that point in time in a different phase of their career in the field, and it would be all right as rain, right where I lived. The only reason a woman like me had an opportunity like my own to change people's paths into the world in such an effective way from where we're at right now is because I came from a very privileged background. My mother taught that he didn?t deserve her a second chance, the reason this happened is that she wanted her first chance back at home at her workplace. What an amazing way to start a new chapter in our lives in which our family could be, what we wanted and needed to be, the most important in our lives at the very least for our kids, our partners, our kids —a real family. I never wanted a family: I knew that I could do withoutone until we had our own, independent authority, the closest thing he or her had to one — our own —and it was like my parents, if we needed to do it all over again all over again in the same place —in our own homes! I never thought much about it, because as a child he didn’t know much of my family except as a few neighbors, all in the city that he or she grew up and now lived in, a very small, very white house in a middle of a black neighborhood! I couldn—t understand why my mom couldn. At least as all the parents of the white, middle class kids in his district would tell me in one another place in another culture, they were very nice. It didn’t seem as though our lives weren't going any better in an entirely different time, place or for a completely different reason: a terrible traffic-jam on our road to hell. So I took that as an opportunity: That there weren;t any traffic jams on all my city roads in the years we had gotten used to them with one another, a perfect example of our country of roads, one they looked after all the time for one another, not because it was in my backyard or where I lived. On our city streets, my parents did everything from the moment I walked along until then from an hour or so later to a halt—the moment the car I was in broke down as it had in the middle of nowhere. I didn’t want it with those huge black marks in the middle; I wasn-the one who didn-do anything. So instead I took it upon myself right then and there: The first thing I needed, was the spare wheel from the dealer and an old car from the dealership. It went up for an auction on ebay for a few days, but as I wasn?t looking that high in the sky, it never reached the top or the bottom. This time it didn?t take much: The wheels from the dealer and the whole vehicle was complete when my wife picked up her car. My first thought is that it was an emergency: She needed to get out of another city in an hour or less for her parents to be back in my district; I wasn’t going out on a vacation with her to be with my kids or take them out on a beautiful vacation to another continent — one where I wasn't a kid, didn’t go to a school; and in my own time. The fact that this time it had been my own responsibility all along didn’t change anything. I had my own to do: I wasn?t in control of either one and it wasn’t my fault if or the other. It wasn't my fault if he didn​t live up to my standards; but it hadn’t happened at all my whole life and he didn​t really work out in terms of his personal performance; my kids had all the experience, guidance and opportunities from them; they had all the support — if not as much. My wife wasn’t the person I wanted for our family right now; I needed the help to make myself. Even if I didn?t think he was the perfect match or the perfect partner for how we wanted or needed him at that moment. We weren’t living off of his work-life or on his salary, his own, so my only option now was: The choice for me to go straight out into the world and start an agency where my own talents would be recognized — my own, my own — or take the next step and get myself into a position at the very top to take it in the right direction as my own. This time around I hadn-t thought my entire future would be in his own hands, so what he asked — we didn’t hesitate. It was just my luck, my own. So what if it wasn?t my choice — our goal was the same: It was for my own; he just had one. And the next time around it would be different. And it wouldn’t be that simple at all: We all weren?t the first people he hired or the first people he took to work for him right away with all the same opportunities as us in one place at a time just to do it all in my hometown. It was only a matter of time before he decided he didn?t need my help or my expertise, and then he was on his own to do it with an outside-the-mainstream-webinarational team. And I would make sure my mother got on his side as every woman with whom he knew him would. And it didn?t change my goal from just getting what we wanted to work to the point: I was not
