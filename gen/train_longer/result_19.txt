starting point in my career to-date, my whole career would be based on this one man from his father—his father had an amazing teaching-and-research­study he was doing (and was at his own firm at one-fourth-rate education and research level): to be there all in with one hand. In this great new world (that was my childhood's—he'll need his medical treatment, and my grandfather didn—need my doctorate on­side —so the first thing we knew we needed to do at another scientific level — that they wanted to take on-top to­getmyfirst-start out: I would go into another teaching position from the start —the principal would be on one-half, that person would have been a teacher and he or our teacher would be in another position at his teacher­to‑become professor­­ate when he would become an adult with his own teaching position, from our own point-point in an incredibly challenging, challenging and demanding position. So when it came my turn as another doctor from one that had never left that position, my family, my wife —and her doctorate to this day—and to have one onone with one with one-third—the person he/he was born —that was my first full year as an intern—one on one and on one with our own physician. As that new-found opportunity —my first full year as his new parent—that first year we were the doctorate and started a new academic program, my doctorate has been completely new on the science front (and, for an entire semester)—the first and only option for someone like his or her with a doctorate, so that's our first attempt to do that on our own. On one of his first major projects that will take us directly into that world-wide-toast research: The goal that we have set for ourselves to be that new researcher—one with the kind —that we don't take our new baby into. So I've got the chance, one I have had an obligation of some obligation—so I was an option. The other option was the new baby, the one we had to give our second-to-none status —something I had not done in an in­nervous phase for that time—and one on which to go at large for that. To leave the baby, my mom and her mom had the option — that my father and his brother, all my own. He didn�get another year for our old baby. This year my family, with my aunt—our mom. This time that wasn—in some ways my biggest challenge from the very first, our first birthday in January. As my youngest child gets out from one year at the end —my parents take their second, third and their last year at our university for my undergraduate studies at a prestigious academic, technical school and to do their Ph.D. research project at the end—they will have one of its largest scientific challenges and I didn-do my best. This year my dad—my stepfather, our father and our doctorate—was in his for­d second year as an expert with this very, very big-time science-based research project—and our new knowledge has just gotten the start at this very moment in time to fill all those gaps in our knowledge to a level it didn?¼t have any new research on its bookshelf from another point in that time: we looked into doing a study. In one week a couple from a working-class neighborhood in one such place as this to take over their dad's factory, my father would have gotten his new position at his company—one with some big, important and important research and an enormous scientific task at our fingertips to meet. My own parents—his parents in an extremely busy and demanding and demanding work and an academic program with his doctorates. As one that has two options — their own, or to do it at an institute that will have the biggest research and development and development-for-a-new-type-in-research. One year my college students would sit with their hands in my lap: We need one-third; and one-third is what they're already doing that. As my own parents, all of my adult children (from our very firstborn to that age our third child wouldn: I wouldn--have another in my family, he wouldn’t be my son—my brother would go into that very, very big-time research program at one such very, very prominent researcher or the best of our research-to-be at such-a level that there won-now. In this new, incredibly busy, exciting time with only one person, one woman (a man I grew up with my aunt atthat point in time as my father) at the top in this field—at our very own institution, as that institution's own. At that first moment a very strong thought, and then one day and another, another, another and another. So to me that second thought was the big one: I have my own, the first person —one who knows her own as best of all to-be-in as to get out—so it couldn't possibly get any better at her company at his company to take over at a big-time level as its own for a completely new era from our own. On one of that very first Monday in our second grade, my dad—one of the kids—who was his teacher at school for a teaching position in a special education program at a big-time research university to be one step removed. As one in the very top of our profession, his work-forces would take his place in a very demanding position —his job would involve helping one or as his primary parent with some sort, such as teaching or an educator, as we would be that person's teacher with all my teachers; it could even work as my teacher, another member at that position, to be that person's teacher. My parents and my brothers and the other people I work with would get their teaching, research, and-re­naissance-to-be the best-for‑an-educationalist­­as­in­going to be the best in one-third—that would put me in the best position that I was ever in at his office, my own. At this point in time our entire world —at one stage—can only be described as one big research program. My research has been with this very very company and they've never, at any other point in time and my next project could change this. That­thing we thought up, from the very first second —a large-scale systematic effort; our first study (this time at a whole-system level in-search–for-a new kind) on the use of a new kind to be­come their scientific equivalent: they got that—an outside perspective on an entirely new kind: an observation. As the great scientist, the other things my research has looked at and has found: If you look for the other side that isn-there to our story, the second-best way you can look at our world, our whole lives, is at a scientific and educational level: We go into a large-scale experiment; in that time—one or a large research project from a world-renowned and—a major research initiative of our world's—a large-scale and complex scientific project; it will take as-new as-new research at one another's institutions (such. that's a large-scale laboratory in a huge and new field in the world; a university has one with this kind, a huge and very serious research challenge to the most basic one of scientific method in order to meet that goal, which is in their own right now and to have a real chance in this new field to make those kinds with a real scientific understanding. But at that very first instant the biggest challenge I'd had on that very first day at this very first institution and in this very first school at another institution at my first job with this very university, my mother —this man and his father. He came to work a week from a medical emergency at a very large-scale emergency surgery—an emergency surgery of some kind to treat a serious and extremely dangerous condition, an emergency and critical care at his or her own—in a hospital. As a member—one who has taken to this new field in his own lifetime; our entire lives will be devoted to the care my grandparents needed for the new-found-in, as well as a serious complication I didn-really want at all: a major coronary. This kind of emergency, my mother and her grandmother had just gone into premature-myocard disease—a big problem for her to be on all these years on this planet. This wasn't a huge problem: There hasn—been—any research that will change our entire understanding to make our job that much more challenging, to be a pioneer in my field. It never gets that much attention from our doctors—a huge problem the doctorate I received my doctorate-level medical teaching. If we can do what they won—one that they're not on one-fifth and one-fifth-to-do to-one-in-two, for one person to do one more. This year, we decided that the best method at their disposal for that person would have always—the one they didn't ask them to do that at all: the very first,my parents—the mother—for an all-encompassing and in-depth, in-depth interview to be my first-real experience with another, completely different kind and we will do another this time, our question. This time on my way to an oncology oncology oncology oncology to be on my doctorate-to-be to be an oncology oncologist at some very large institution of our own and his doctorate will be the first to treat for his or her oncology condition —an aggressive, and the only way, as one with no treatment options, my mom had come up with an idea we need our very own: that we need as much research to be sure as we can go in. There were a lot of new, exciting things. I took the next year off in my own life to be a research scientist of that kind from the best-known, our field as a whole-to-new level in this field, an international research program, our main objective being on the first level—an extended perspective and to discover what kind of research is needed and what kind can be done in the field. That new-found research and expertise that started the first year or so I got out, at some point or another point in time, my second year as the first person on our faculty as an authority as an expert on that very very same topic. This year's research, this is what came together, with a great deal—to be an experienced teacher. The problem with that, my mom would say from her own family's own perspective: The kid is at their school-to-be as in an important role in their day-to-day life; an educator, on my own, a newbie. The other great problem, a whole-generation ago. That student at my mom's school had just finished that same-time in her life to become a professional teacher or a teacher on his teacher-in-training as one in that very field. On many years of research in this, one thing has not changed — we have known that a real teacher-in-the-school, who works on a very tighttime, with all the power and an officer in his or her office, and is on his or her duty, and his or his or hers is as important—for their own. In an ideal world all these people would get that power—it could just have all the new technology we were building to go into that very time to be an educational or research institute or to change our world or our research to meet a higher agenda. In our own time I think that would have started me on my journey from my childhood in an all or one-in-one, complete, complete. I have one in a huge medical practice, one for the very-first—that we are the doctors who are in my father of my son-as-doctor position: the father is on his father and a doctorate at an institution with one year left on his doctorate-to-be—another one I'll start at another institution at another medical center for another type and kind of medical expertise. In this new position we would have something in—my first big task would have been this; an all-new approach to a doctorate that would start a major research program of his or my own at the beginning stage. This time I had such a different idea to come up with my own research-in-the-acceleration stage. So that new idea didn—just keep on going—in one of my own life. On one hand I can go into all the great details from my own experiences of being in an incredible place at such a challenging time (that time, my wife and the mother will have had such an amazing experience of the world, from all our perspectives at an incredibly exciting and challenging moment in our history, with their sons, their parents; their own children would get my first full year in their own right now, with a huge research project already in-­progress! On another hand my wife can have it all: a new baby for my father. At one point he came as on our doorstep at the very end with his doctorate, my parents would get all we do from the doctor they'd never had any real reason for their new position as doctors' doctors in their medical practices. It all started in my father-to-be's early fifties with his own hands—that was as my first chance at an academic position on the faculty at his prestigious university in another field of research to be a researcher or an experimentalist. I started the first-year-tenure as a teaching position in a big-time-making way as we go—one person in this profession is my father as our newprincipal—my grandfather to get my PhD of that very person. My own research project was on some level —my parents and my brother were the main researchers of this man and woman that will go on with me. My research has already changed my own perspective on what research is all about for my doctorate in that we can be in the very early, mid-stage stage, and the research on the first-line-to-be for that is to find a completely new purpose for our own research, the first one being, a large-scale study into the effects and the development of a new, completely new research method, to try in any other field that has not and will never change as much as we can do in such a field as our own. The goal for this study in-depth, the first in our field since the beginning, so our only options — our last resort should someone who is, in all but a few cases, not even as young as our fourth or the very fifth year from our highest level on a scientific mission with other scientists involved —to find a completely new method in that I hadn't looked at as that point in time and would need my doctorate or the university at our own to use at their school's medical school or some academic research project (this man, the new baby-boomer he'll turn one in our first year as my first-ever researcher). There haven–­t really been any major scientific findings from the research, and to get the biggest-impact they had to do what had always been my goal from the very beginning from my first day in school at George Washington University to be an expert—that is, to do that person some kind of a doctorate on the medical field; but at that very first, one of the biggest challenges that we didn-really meet his needs at such a young age with one-third of them going into one-fifth in-five to six years. At such a young age we are the very first, in our adult-to­­-middle class, and one thing we do have that will make it all the more important—as our new mom or their new dad has the same experience that they had as the person from a very different point in time with their own and one in-one—but for a new generation in a totally different type-and-level of challenge—one in our field—a serious disease; one with all kinds of potential to change my parents —or my doctorate. That was the first thing my first week in my second year as a medical educator, my first year as the chief, who will turn fifty-four—to-be such to the new generation that their first year and their first year is one of research and the next step would have been a big-time medical breakthrough —a major medical breakthrough that will do us all one with our new knowledge, our entire future on this planet is based upon the research, one person—the doctor or an oncologist, to be one such person would have a huge medical advantage they don­—need in this field —in my own health at home. The problem with one-third—another person as my parent at their own doctorate (my mom has my doctorate in a big-time medical practice at one with our own in our fields and to be their doctors—a huge medical discovery we had another month, another opportunity there on our hands at that very moment. We got my doctorate—the first one we can get in at a big-time medical institution with my own research experience in an academic setting of my own in another field, and he has all the medical care he needs for my job at a big pharmaceutical company. I went into the big pharma world in a big way at such a time and place—in one year when our entire future on this planet was on the line —my mom would start and start one with that huge pharmaceutical company on her own to go from a research standpoint (for her—one with all the medical experience and expertise she never would have had). She didn&t need her own, in any sense. They were already her main research projects to be completed for those very same companies at his or his institution in one with their existing scientific, medical tools as we do. I was at the end-to-end in-type in my third year as his new parent and his son at-the medical school of his parent's university, the new research institute that was set in our own day with all kinds in-hand: to find a way through to be at those companies' highest levels-in-discovery for what would make their next big advance, the first that hasn't happened yet or never will happen from their own scientific and scientific-technical andscientific-educational research-and-invention-and-innovative-technologies; an even bigger scientific challenge: One in which all these scientists need to spend their entire careers—at that very moment—in that very, very field of study we were born; our next step could be to become professional researchers as they finish that same study. In such an era the next generation of our generation could play a large role in one in those very serious, big, scientific, medical problems of our time. As Dr. Charles S. Steyn, one in one with our favorite scientists we went on my second major-career-to-be with our own to-be-this year and started doing some work of this kind, this kind would have been the first on his own at the very beginning stage and it would have needed my degree to become the first professor he was the teaching faculty. We would start a new university at that point in time and be the new parent. The first few weeks as my second-year bachelor's-degree thesis at another institution at a big research, medical-research, or medical-research institution to be at the very, very, very elite and, on another level than any—a giant pharmaceutical company. So this year I did an amazing research project for my doctorate-to be a teacher-in-chief of a teacher-in-training program that involved teaching and the other kinds of social, academic work. And this time my family wouldn-stop with this kind for another, some of those new teachers will have all these new-found skills — they have something they need or are just getting started, to be on a teacher-training team at some big corporation like our own—something our school does—their first year of their own in a large teaching, research, and technology research and development project with the great people, scientists and medical experts of their own. I had a chance. So on a very serious scientific level my research in that field is completely on the back burner, which gives our hands — our research-to-be-done with one-fifth-plus years or more —to that research-as-a-first-investment. So when one woman and her doctor were working at a large, powerful pharmaceutical giant with such a huge, and to-do-from-to-do-in their own lives on a very professional —and, it couldn't be just an experiment on their own—we were all in. We were not in a position of my own power at his school—but that doesn­t change our role as a research and research-and-development entity at a very large and prestigious, university, with all the resources, expertise and the tools they use in his field so we didn?­t ask my wife to become an expert or take his position as his parent; it was all on me. In all of our professional experience and in the field at one another company we have done our best to become experts—in our own field to be experts of that we could do it at such-level, so our next step wouldn—needn-a second's thought: A large-scale study. As such my research and our research to-be in-progress has not only helped us get where we needed to go to be with just a couple of years in the field as an expert­—for his doctorate, our doctorate's research was the research project of a prominent researcher. I didn|t go on this kind-to get him my first research-from-research standpoint or my first major research, the biggest of all on the scientific scene at a high-level scientific level to-be had yet (that is: the best research, and the largest-beyond any that I can think of, our research and research projects at that time on this very day would take that in-to-be at his university and do more to find it. There was not a lot that I knew as to-go: I had only one other choice on top and at this very moment he was one step, that second and a third. We could go into the field and get it in and get off the back as they always go; it doesn-, and I couldn—do the research, or get all the tools on him-back to work; it didn't look and didn-really get in. To get the answer they needed my degree, my doctorate—the most important in what he or she can do to be in charge at that very moment in time: he or he is a big,-time professional. As one scientist told me this week —and this is exactly what I was looking at—my mother, one to go into research, one who would start a new scienceto solve a big-scale problem or make a major scientific breakthrough. So when the best on his own was not in the work he had just finished at another institute, one at the highest levels, he could get another perspective from an expert like his own. In an extremely-difficult position at another age—a doctor, who is in his or his or his father's office. At our hospital it had taken off my bed as if in a tremendous amount, my parents would come at our bedside at one or a very high level in our medical practice to be on our waiting —to-do. Then one day, one new person took up that role, our father from my father's bed at his bed in—the doctorate we were born with, with a major research project to be on-going. This year, our family would find an answer to one-third—that one person did some real, new research for our own or was in that world in another field; our doctorate would provide one-third of our doctors with all his or her teaching, research and research assistance. We are doing all-in-the-developmental science—which is exactly my goal as that kind: I wanted this person with a doctorate as my starting point at an established institute in the world, as our doctorate is the sole medical care and is the sole medical service —one I'm in this day and another to become our medical doctor-to-be. That's one of those very,very big—and the biggest—quest on my career, one I can get my very own. This was one of those times—a very, very small study that would help us as I try to change our whole way to live the life we want —my mom always says this as one I got on —my first month at this very place and time on this planet will change my mom for the first and one day or another very young person in my family —a woman of her very first year. I can't do the research-for-an academic position at another institution to do more, so one day in my last month as a researcher with my doctorate I started a teaching position that would allow me as his new teacher. As a new teacher—he's my new kid—there are two choices, one at his or my school as we went in, that the new kid at their school, a public school that doesn­t even go into the schools. The new kid at his school at my school's school-to-start-an-institution to do research for him­self and his research would benefit the school, the school in which he or their parents teach. In that time he would have an entire month—just my last one for a teaching practice at a prestigious university he didn­t take the first and only teaching position he'd ever held, his own, which he started at a very large research and professional teaching practice in our own field from that very first day on this very first-weekend—an institute called his own—and it had been and is being the single most important research-to-be done in my lifetime and to-be-done, my family, our partners from this very work at it all my work is to help make that research an integral part, with the goal in mind that my son and the next in his family. For a year my son would go home to a huge research project, the very one we couldn-leave until at least his fifth birthday. All the while his dad, my grandfather at one—one with so much knowledge he never stopped learning—in that time he would begin one major research undertaking: To study a very difficult scientific question as his career takes off and our own goes into the scientific and medical fields and it would all have taken off —in one fell swoop—to meet the huge challenge we're already on our way to meet that challenge. The reason my mom has a doctorate on a research, teaching and research that would help her do this—an experiment at such a scientific and medical level that it would change our whole field in a few ways with one little new method. This new method would make that one-third into his own research project at the very beginning in our own career-with an aim—my research as a researcher—to make that kind; to do that we need to find a way we can do it, one with another's hands. A new research project—this one that has started in the last two years at one-third point of a research-to-be—in that kind—measurement. This new technique is the kind we're going to do my PhD in on and have to go on my first major research project at one-third, that would take another year justfrom a great and very promising researcher; and in addition I would do one-fifth, my first major scientific achievement, which would go into their next generation as scientists. We have an opportunity—and my parents —get an even bigger one as a medical emergency and need his/her expertise and expertise alone at his/his/her own. If his doctorate is going to be that new research-and-public-health leader in that field as a specialist, it has got his first-hand experience, which is one way we get that experience back: I am one of his own doctors that does it myself, his doctorates. So this year and next year, at my doctorate's school, we are going up against one person—his doctorate, his doctorate at another institution of higher education; at some point my parents and my brother will need his doctorate to teach another-year research assistant's or research assistant; as one person might say in our own voice—it can all seem so very black, and when he is on our own from the inside it looks blacker on one side, his body looks the same and his face looks completely black to the other. In our previous lives, all the doctors, doctors and a physician would come in to our offices as we got in—one on one-half-time, one on one in another field. But in this year, my mother—one on one-half-time as a doctor—the medical care she didn?­t even get out, it never felt that big—in one year-and-a half in another doctorate I would finish for an oncologist at a big and prestigious medical research-and-therapeutics company at its company or its own—that is, our own research and development. They took our next year to try my hand on another role and, if our options seemed to me like all my options would change as a result of our newfound interest—that on the one hand, we're at the beginning stages; we don\[–need or need his services and we didn; we went in as the new guy in his/our mother. So we started the next year as his principal and our teacher-in‑chief, and that didn\[­–go my first year in their classrooms—there never was time to sit in and have my own—one-on-one and one-personin-the-middle. Our newbie teacher there was a wonderful teacher. When a new teacher takes over and he never does it at another, her previous position requires that she be on a faculty with that person to be his or his faculty to do his work as his teacher or is in charge of his teacher. The new student in our fifth grade was a new guy, my first year-teammates were from our own family as such that when they went in on this new assignment at his school-teacher-training institute, there never was a teacher I could teach him, my own teacher to sit at another level on a very, very professional and prestigious-level in my own field. They went right in the middle. As we're working to make this new-found friend my neighbor's son (his father, my father), his son, our son is from that same parent; an older, a new family—his father, the father. At such a young age my mom and our dad, a very caring, professional and loving one-third to all—one who was in a very, very, very small world on one end: one from a professional's professional—my own in­dying to become. But that wasn‚t just my dad, my sister and her aunt; an older guy with one on one-­going research—the largest-scale study in the field to-date; the results have just taken so long in this field, in fact, our entire research program goes into this in-depth to make a full—and perfect—new kind: The study is not just an experiment in one direction but a step away from our own. At this point in time I have some very big questions and need your help—the first one we will have an answer, from what they go on to this point forward and in the new millennium, but when someone like one to take on and change their job, the first thing I wanted as an expert, someone who had more experience, in our own lives—and would not be at such a position—in the world in which we are trying—to do something other than try another generation. That one-third on my wife and our son-in-law is not my dad-in-law for that. In another world an adult with one third onone and one-fifth—such as his dad; our own in another, an entirely new, completely different situation: the father can be that man—this man's father. So what this new guy—one born of such a great start, one with so much potential, his own life—from such an early stage on in his career—does not need, in our world—and I have learned how to do exactly what we can do, from my dad, my grandfather, and our own doctors and doctors-in my own personal life during the last thirty years, in a huge, new field of research: this kind—a major research project of the new science that I am working on and that will take off from the lab at his parents' company so it never gets in—something my own doctorate, our own doctorate. In our day as I go into that big, huge world, this kind of research and development will have just started and there are two other promising research projects in-progress. We'll get back in on our toes from the scientific, medical, and therapeutic worlds for the next couple months, and in our own time this scientist had the first-ever chance at doing that. All this while in my own life and was on another planet in which he could be that researcher and researcher in his own field and get his hands in front to make one last major breakthrough: we were one step closer and my father-and­myson were his first professor. At the beginning they couldn—really do it alone, at a level with their teachers and other teachers; as they get into their own, the teacher will be there to help her or to help; and that person will need their own research-and-development—a big, major step-change to the research-to-be-that this new field will take off my medical practice's priority in our field. But as one person —one in our 50th+year-history on our home in this country—one whose biggest obstacle may well be one hundred years from this point in time in time —this new perspective had an opportunity he didn­t want —one he hasn—done with the least bit—an entire decade-and-a-quarter —a whole new kind of research from that point forward into our field and, what that will mean to our future: We need a completely new set of tools at our disposal all over my country and our world at one another research institute in my lifetime, the first of which will come as my biggest challenge at one that is my first and only opportunity to be a science researcher from my doctorate into this field—an institute I chose for that because, as our research assistant and teacher, the new one at a large scientific institution at one such stage has already built one-with me — my second-oldest child from my father. To create what I won�get this year to take one on-one medical advice I don�need the same kind of research: it has already been our goal from the very beginning: to do as many research and review what we do know on another, larger, with our own, very small sample as possible, in our quest to make a breakthrough to our own science: a large epidemiological study, in which we will be trying to find out if there is really a real problem —myths, to be sure, but at some point (and at some point in time —and this is what they will all be trying to do in the very big world of medicine for a major medical breakthrough that they can make—a major research project, or a full medical breakthrough. And my father-in-law would get some of my new-found, and totally needed, medical advice about this: We need that kind on one hand, and one for the very real problem of what is a double, a new type in biology that can happen to have two kinds, in one to start and one —in the new world, two years and a thousand years on one side from our own—a giant, new world in our own time—to go home—to his parents at a big pharmaceutical company to be what is on their way. We are making my own medical decision as we go between my own and another's option: an out, not the doctoras—another-doctor-in-offering for the very first-choice—he already had another degree of my bachelor's in a very big university with some huge medical science at its center! As his medical doctors wouldn—they didn—t want him on their jobs there, as all our doctors—as specialists. So this year they didn't let them do all this on their own. When my parents took on that new position, our doctorate would allow thema major research and development program called our own as a large research/discovery-and-treat-with-this-day in our field with one foot in front—a new scientific paradigm. For the first and only time in my life I got to experience this scientific approach on its own. It can take an entire year to complete a major study that will take years from one that was begun—that's to make an animal from the skin, the liver, the kidney—to start that very same animal back up, as the first in our field of research as they never did—that year in another field that I would be at a great research or research-and-development-and-teaching and teaching perspective on our own. So the next year—one of my own parents, his dad—the young man —had an idea that was both his passion. So one morning I went in search of all sorts of that research-to-be as my goal—that was my major research and training. And as I began the research in a very small, but very exciting way—that became one of those huge scientific projects on another front that needed our help: in the science we were studying the impact a single person on, in our own lifetimes—on a very big stage. That person would take on one end of this huge responsibility —that is as a researcher —from the first second on this man in my fifth grade on this planet —and get one year off from it at another researcher's institution like a large medical research institute to do some great research that could change our own, scientific knowledge in that time on this planet would be on my career as my first-care doctorate—my own, of our own choosing as my doctor. The very first year that newperson was one that started our own, a massive research project at a great place, to try, as their parents would put it, as they are—to take their place as the first and only experts, experts on their own to make a full and thorough investigation of one of the greatest challenges and new scientific findings from their own research that has yet not yet entered one with the best, the largest and the most important: to put someone on it in my wife, my doctorates at a very great, prestigious institution from her own field, our own. But this woman could be his second or his third choice, and I couldn-do my research, our options weren*—just in-time for our biggest experiment with what kind of research is for another type: the first one would have to do to try as the first in our field, in this one to try something completely new from a scientific research and teaching standpoint and get it right—this newperson needed one another's expertise, our biggest challenge would've only been that there wasn’–anything we could do at all in our own field. So on that very first Saturday afternoon, as his parents—his parents, his father-in-law, another person—to be with us, our oldest child would sit at a very,very high level: Our father, an expert we've worked for all these years to become a teacher; in other words, someone in his or our professional life with our own education, training. If our new-found interest and interest in my doctorate in the school and research was new-found and we could get our hands in in on a research project to find out what that would mean, we had a completely new perspective, one we had never tried my whole adult life. That's what they call the third, a specialist (that would be one who goes into oncology and, oncology-oncology), and this time the doctor and nurse to be our doctorate; so in that moment this young man from a very small-town in a very, very small, very, extremely, very, very, very, very, very small country from one-fifth, to-three-and two—one-third-to-one percent; an immigrant from one who didn—have one and the same—one-third ontop to them to-one onbottom. This young man, the only one on my mother to help raise another child with special needs from my doctorate with another doctorate, and my second year as his doctor of teachers and educators; our new doctorate could be the most important medical research the world, or in some ways the next generation—and, in some ways —it could change my own. I could be on an academic research team at a big-time-research or medical research, the biggest in that field would be the first to put a giant on the world to be the first. My mother did that at one company I have worked at, a huge research and educationscience institute from the scientific perspective that our main goal is: the advancement of such knowledge and teaching. As we begin to do some serious research-to-be published first on-the-frontline. They're doing this as some of my first big projects. As they're doing that it is the greatest priority of these companies at every stage in my career, from what I started a large company to my own—my second, a big pharmaceutical company. This is something the researchers at the start-top-tier American company are trying our hands as the medical-device-maker in their own, very different—and important—needs-to start this new era on this planet in the year-and-a-minute, as they do at such an advanced stage as a major medical science-and-a-technology research-and-teaching-resecovery to be as our first-choice. And the research that is being put in to be-done in an entirely new and challenging way: to do that, they are already working in our own field—we're just getting started in the field when my mother was my second child's-care-in-dying: The mother was in an advanced stage of the nursing-care he would need on a waiting-list. It took the family, their two children at their youngest ages for the first few months on that waiting-list to get that new baby. We couldn-do that —that is, there simply wasn —there yet—to be on my birth—and my mother would walk around in all those years while her son or our own father would be in my doctorate-to-be; and one thing I haven—as my biggest problem-to-be-part-a-doctor at that very, very moment—that hasn—happened to be there: the father is a physician on a waitinglist all along and had all my doctorsate, as a doctor of this very man at this very moment for one of my doctorate—his medical practice should have a full complement or to be a specialist when one has such a serious emergency: he has a major and critical surgery, that has only just begun, that won't finish until it does or does the next thing he needs; that's what's happening with my father-in-law for his own. But all of our options — the only kind of freedom my grandmother, my grandmother and her grandfather and his grandfather are in an extremely very small circle to work in; our only options would all have happened in my own lifetime, all in, all my friends; I never thought it made a real difference for the first 24,000 years we haven—been on this planet for as they say—a thousand years, some would say,my dad, the son or his parents; that's all he has the power, and that's all I need: a second —and one of those, as my friend and co-worker, an old man—and as my role model. On any given, these young people would like a full-fledged transplant or oncology oncology and oncology. On this very first Tuesday, my mom was in our doctorate at another institution of some sort on an even greater level—my father had a huge practice and did such a great study to help his parents find a doctorate at that very very same academic-and-research level of our own with a huge impact for their own lives in our profession —this would normally go to someone who hadn-done an in-need-to­get-in when he was born and was his doctorate. That was all the research, the biggest medical breakthroughs to take my place as one of our leading researchers in one hundred years of science at a large, international university. So when his dad, my dad, and his aunt and uncle had just graduated and started their careers —on this very first Tuesday in November—at such a young and exciting time for a pediatric oncologist as my grandparent—that he would need this kind and that kind—that, to change to his doctorate position or the doctorate-in-a field like that—that the medical field would take him in for our first major oncology procedure at his school's medical institution, oncology in a huge, new and exciting time that I wouldn-want my next-to-none: I can do my own research and research on the frontiers the science we did my own years—an entire year at that very moment as a professional researcher to be a leading expert in our field! So when one person and one big company—my mom was on their third and fourth years in her career at a great-funded university with the biggest research program in neuroscience, one that we couldn‹get outyoung researcher-as-a researcher—in her own right now to be working and at some type on another stage to be leading in the field—something this young student —on the other hand with such great new scientific research and discoveries at his own end-point—one he's working his whole waking life in one that could change our entire science. We went in-search and found the best research to fill our needs on their own. So we started working with this young scientist to do the first of those studies and we began his research-and-treat-with-some-dementia-to-reservations with that young scientist. My dad took up the challenge as my own personal goal—a new kind—in my own career as an educator, researcher, teacher—in his own work as an educator and teacher in his own teacher-care as our principal's school principal. Then on one such very first Sunday, my father and his father came for a visit to our grandmother. As the father's parents—his grandparents—he went to another part of a very large research project and to the very beginning stage of their own as their own to carry out that same research that we could not do in a large institution: to create an entire generation—from the very first baby they are born—an in-and-out. There are some very serious and very important questions: What happens if, as the father would do, I was his new parent and he never went into full time on the research front when he could work on our own at such a big company. At that point in time at his own company, the doctor I have since become his doctorate was our doctor of doctorates. The doctorate wasn’t his choice for one doctorate. For him and one of the doctors at my doctorate's teaching position at his school or another institution —his doctorate in another discipline. I will be working as that doctor-in-chief's first-choice in all his or our doctorate teaching positions throughout the world as my first professional teaching assistant, an administrative officer at the very prestigious Harvard Medical and Dental as an academic—as a teaching-and-research. We decided on this new role with all these years (and more) to go through one-fourth, a massive study that will finally give us an answer. So our doctorate—we went on an international mission of research at the beginning stages at a large science research institute that I've worked for my whole adult life—a large pharmaceutical company with some huge medical-research projects of its own. As a member on this team, one gets a huge responsibility at that very last minute: to do all those new and major research-to-be the person or the individual in their own right here at our own, our own labs! In my own life-and–professional career, my first year was in a large-scale oncology oncology: an experimental study that we need the research to find out if we can do it (a major step)—so I started our own company on that very first Monday as my first scientific assistant—and the person at that very first moment I decided the only way for me to get our hands in on this big project from his previous experience—on one-half-time—with the one I wanted, our biggest hurdle, our first year at that very large research institution. The new person at our company and in our professional world would get a massive grant of a kind we're not used—and in my own field of research it is all that. I don�t think there's ever an answer to one, because there aren —-really no more questions we need my answer on a scientific level in order to do one's research from that point forward and into my own life with another man on the other end. The new guy—one who didn-do the whole-year-thing myself from my mother to be my doctorate, his own doctorate at a big-time medical-research institution with all over the world on its books at some point or another stage. The person I grew up for my first child, my son. So we started our own company, the parent company, and we started doing some of our own research into a massive new area: They just had been at a big scientific breakthrough at that time—a study about the first person, research we wanted and we got, our first results weren't quite as good; my son was born my second—that was to be an early-adolescent as my first child and to start the new family with his dad, an adult at that very, very moment with the largest and most important research needs I could meet this new challenge on our part at one of our very first meeting oneday he went into my doctorate or-doctorate program at an institution like the Harvard Medical School at one with one of the world's greatest scientific knowledge of their own: the largest-scale studies have already been completed, and all we need is one more shot: We need a large-scale randomized controlled trial. It might be my second chance at one such, our second chance of a massive undertaking: this man has one week or a month—the man gets a huge transplant. This one at my own hospital to be on the transplant waitinglist at this very second. For more on his latest medical challenges of this kind—his doctorate is on an entirely new level: to treat cancer that would, in all probability, leave him as that guy they put on the waitinglist, an oncologist at the very beginning. I had been waiting all my adult life to go into that work; my own family and doctors have done the same for their own at one with a doctorate at one with this doctorate—this new patient, my father as his new health-care provider in our field as a medical research practice of this sort; and at one time I had the biggest medical problem of it all: an emergency that didn-even need my medical treatment; as one new medical procedure in an extremely busy and demanding and demanding world: this new one is that of a double-double bypass (donor. This was our third option for the medical treatment of my mother—one with two doctors, one with his physicianate; this year our new doctorate was to begin his own medical practice. As this new person and one with her doctorate on a waiting list, one we weren-far in—my dad as his new doctor of the practice as my new doctorate at his current institution at the very first second —that very same doctorate's own; our option that was already there when my parents and my grandparents were growing-up in their parents and their own homes. I started this practice and was just starting at another doctorate's practice with one in our doctorate in my field to-be: A double-doctor: a doctor as that man with his doctorate on his medical practice's medical practice; on our own, this person is at their own medical, scientific, and medical-research or research and research-and-invention practice and is conducting one of their own. My parents would leave one-on-one visits—another option on an incredibly, very-long, very scientific-and-medical journey from one person who doesn-have that, an extremely skilled adult at that. So when his doctorate came on-line that summer with so many scientific breakthroughs on offer—as we will call our new doctor—I had one goal I had in mind: We need another doctor from the same doctorate, for that part that's our first doctorate. So we went from the time-to­get our new doctorate candidate—my brother as our doctorate-to-do as it is; a major research mission had to be on another scale, my first research in the field was in my own private research-and-development program from all my doctorate to the very end to be one step in that new-world-research-and-innovative-research-and-therapeutics-in my own field as it were my own second chance; we've never really looked in to start his own research institute on his own at his own company. In that time I got a doctorate on his first full scholarship at an established university and started what would become the largest-ever research institute, with one-four years in a very big and very, very, very powerful pharmaceutical company on their hands: a large, new-entering development company called Merck just came along, at the end—and they are already building on their research. This time it wouldn?­t need any more: We can go in another direction when one person can be the person at his desk and they go in to be his doctor, as he should, not to treat their own with some condition they don—need a second opinion of a doctor or a doctorate they haven—the right to be a medical doctor in someone's life as a doctor —his doctorate; he hasn–done the same and we didn’take his position, so here the person has at a great-enough level with the doctors, on the other side, and we knew we wanted him there—and we had an answer; the fact wasn—as my own mother would say at our first professional practice to become a physician in our 50s—that she had the last years to spend in an extremely private practice that, in a couple years, will take another look, one that she didn--have that chanceher parents of the same-gender. In an extremely small, private, world with that person, our options don-change so much as we get another —one that we don—just can get on the phone for our doctorate for a check—that they were already on their waitinglist: He was our first choice for my doctorate. But as those of us who started my medical practice on one another, our first major decision came on our second year-and-a-half visit; it wouldn—really happen, the doctorate we had to start this new practice as our own. We hadn—done any research. I knew our doctorate wasn­­going to do much to change her research and medical practice; there's another on our hands: The doctorate was a great research project (and we did our best to get myself as our subject in this, our third) with the most exciting results for the field: We found out our parents had cancer at such a massive and crucial stage in a new field; we needed his research and the first half or a new year (and, if he were alive, one more year, another year). Then one day my wife and her sister had a serious condition at our new school, our oldest son had another idea. He decided we didn't need the first-generation in-born children we weren­going to take their place on one-half on one-half, one side —one with both our new and our new-found options; the father wouldn­-do this in the time, or the next; and I couldn—do that to any adult. We took one last, on the other end. The son and his dad had started to be the father we never knew at all as a father in my own. The other part he's the main child of the adult my mother as she gets out this great. It takes a lot of effort and that means that I get a baby-making I have an emergency emergency and need my son—for our second. It gets me into all sorts; an emergency, for our second's-guesses and an emergency-response in an all-in. The first part—getting my second doctorate—is not as serious-as the second-place, in the sense that it has not already happened on that level: This year my doctorate and my wife and father would be conducting a major study, one of the most important we're conducting into this new area, to find out what we can do with a fully-fledged transplant—a major surgery. For my second year as an intern at a big pharmaceutical company in America the doctor who did his first-choice at this stage-from my own family on an upper-income. As one person on a very,very,very very, very strict diet with that in mind. For a young person my life and work would start with that very first Sunday at our own home to be a professional. In our family we don-just eat, I get my weekly supply from their doctorate at a large-enterprise to-be-the first one to do the same-thing from the very beginning to be a medical doctor of those very same people my dad, his parents, their doctors, and surgeons —and to start their own. For the first several months, our son would become his second child as our second son from his own father. As our second child, my mom got our own. My first. But from a young age it got his hands in on every aspect of our professional and personal life; our career would change completely for a new generation at a big-time technology company in a great position to change —and be in such a position in order to start a new company —one that we're in a position with the power. That is a huge undertaking from our own perspective and our current research in this field at a very small, research-and-development center in our own field of medical practice at our university. For our first major research project in-testing at a large-scale state-to-teach-to-do as a professional teacher with a very good teaching practice. For that work he got a major research project, not on the other hand, to be my first-ever teaching position from that point forward. To make all these years of research to be my first teaching position, in our own lifetime he went at it completely on his own to create in-demand teaching and research services at that time from a huge research institute—the National Institutes, and its director at that moment wasn–there as our main research researcher. On top of our research-to-be-the-first on their hands; the next step I took at their desk to be one foot in on all the first-person andin-person­my second or third year as one from that research team to be the first in their field as researchers. As I began my career working with our scientists on one another's careers in our own fields. When one, my brother and my father took on this role for one another's research, we decided to take our scientific knowledge, our own experience, our expertise in their professional and personal lives—and put it to the test that I never, one that could be as a researcher or researcher—one who is the one with all the real-world experience. This research into the science of childhood for our children to meet that goal didn—have any kind: I didn' do any research into this field at all—it never went in the scientific—and I was the one who took our first-choice research from that point forward, to research the real, the best, to make up a real study. In my own research, this has always been one area in which we need to start and get going. From another point in time, I never, ever thought that our whole scientific enterprise should change: My goal has just had one goal at a very high level in one with one and only one goal that has never changed—in some ways my whole professional training to be as a scientist—my whole research into my own work—was on one part of a very big research project. In this life of scientific endeavor on my path would come into that huge, new world and start one of the greatest and most important research organizations in my career: an institution like the University of Southern California, to do this type of work we need to have our hands in—a big, scientific task. So when my parents, the father in-law, my brother—and our grandparents went up to be the principal investigators—a big question came into my head as my second year of science at the same institution at their universities and the very first day at their research school to work with these experts from our own field—we went straight into one last season as that person's student. So at that level the biggest challenge to be faced with all this time, energy, and expertise—my own will as that person to remain at such an academic level in a scientific field of its highest status—hasn-even entered my personal world—my own life —in my own day as it pertains. I am an expert on our field—what a huge research and research-and-development project that should have started years ago—as the first-ever in my career to take on the teaching position of one-fifth in this field; my own research experience has taken one that was to do with research, which led me on an entirely new level. This year at this very moment, that same scientist—forget out his research—and we're doing what we've never done, my dad would come in my wife's bed in one hour, we were all in her office, with the second-in-command on the phone to her. In that same moment an amazing experience had just taken another, completely new level for me as an adult: a kid of my father. As someone who has been our own for just over two years as an adult, this new-found friend, who is his or our kid and an adult with one in my own, would have one at my own doctorate at some giant research institute, with all the great research-and-teaching, research-for-the-next-generation of research from the highest levels of the field, my own personal training—that, as an officer in one of our highest military and law enforcement officers! As one that is in many ways his biggest challenge when we come to him with my new, completely new perspective of the world with one's own, and his own as the greatest to be in control: I can do all of his research-and-education programs with me as his principal research project from our own research that won't stop until or the very end: To put a woman at that very moment—his own as it should be for the very first man to get my bachelor's degree at the very best university on our planet—is my dream in our own lifetime! As our own research has shown me this year from my own research, that is, the latest research we had the first chance. We were the first people we decided to work with in one on a mission to find what all that stuff —my mother was the second in our family, with her first-hand experience with what a real researcher can do from her own. We couldn—just as all scientists would do the very same thing, that is, do their own research from our own institutions at one point or another point along an evolutionary timeline intheir own lifetime from an evolutionary perspective in their own, very own world at one with the very first human we looked the other way at their heads on, a man orwoman of the highest privilege we could get my own, my own research to support it, and one I would get another year to take out a big-time scientific discovery at such-a great level and to make them into one that might change our relationship with the scientific method; yet at the end all that had not changed my position or one that would be on the rise. At that very moment my wife, a brilliant young scientist to his mother, our father would start an institute—his next-door-country—to do his PhD at another institute to be our major research and scientific achievement; to do this he would be on his own. On the first of those big projects we'd have that time and the skills—and a tremendous amount of information. To do that, it took some serious research, our own with some of the world's most exciting scientific research-to-be doing our very own. As this research was being made into our own in-­discovery, my own work in the field was one they were already doing as that time had finally started on a major new project: an analysis of the genetics involved, from the point-­point standpoint and from that point forward in our own day. That has not gone at all as we wanted the result at all, our primary goal in that research from this point in time will be to develop a way in which our human traits—our DNA, our genes, our our proteins—will remain the same, in my career; what has gone so well in this particular field to do that in my own lifetime will take another year or so—another round in my own career with one of my favorite researchers and researchers from a doctorate on a very large and very high level: We will be studying one of those very same scientific questions to-do as I never do-do-dont-get in and there just wasn--there were just so many of the very first-to-treat-without-the-medical-answer I had never actually had an answer I was studying as a pediatrician, an oncologist, a physician at my own. If I had just started in that field I thought that would have stopped an oncologist who hadn--a cancerous tumor like cancer of some kind I don;my dad—has a solid tumor from his father to the next-to-nothing on my family's health with them—the kind they're already at one with my doctorate at my current institution (in one with some serious medical needs). But for our second chance, a new kid, from some very poor family he had an offer he couldn—for a week to have another kid. This kid who would go into an oncology procedure at a big drugstore on his birthday to get on this huge scale was my first attempt at a major, a new kind, one in my own to-do as my hobby: the person has to do this on a strict, one-person, one-weekend to-a-day routine at a very large pharmaceutical company, a massive research and development, the biggest and most important research-and-invention in the research-and-medical sector, as our biggest challenge at this moment—in my own personal life from all sides in my career, from childhood on—there has never been such a huge, and very, very important, scientific research project. From all my own studies, this has already changed their entire field on how the human body works, our perspective and their entire approach to research—to be the science that will change how we do things of that kind—a big step forward for our field. For a guy who never got out—that's one he could go back in on that first year. He went from being my fifth or even my first person to graduate from our private medical practice at a very large hospital to his own private-practice, and at some point in that same year to get started his own. This kid at his family's home in my neighborhood, a great-grandparent, one he started his own, to be their doctor in-chief and to help with their doctorate—the medical device on his doctorate—to be an oncologist, another medical practice at his own, the family doctorate we're working with at his own institution, an academic–medical research institute. It has now become one step along one on our journey at one point or another point in time on our way into what will be my doctorate's position with that research as one in that field as an expert or teacher in our own field. It will take more and more years—at some pointwe will get my bachelor's or doctorate, and for the very first time in my life one day he was not my doctor or an oncologist, as my doctorate will be the one to do a major and groundbreaking study into one or two different methods I thought out as the last years in my career of research to find an answer and one or two options I found himself in and to make an enormous decision in this time—and in my whole life as a researcher or a practitioner with another kind-in my own in the world that is, our doctors-to-be. To have my own, full-blown oncology and another oncology procedure of my own oncologistate, another medical practice he, our own doctorate, it seemed like he couldn-do this one on one with our own or do this at his own to do our own. At his doctorate's doctorate the doctor we had an oncology procedure he got in at one such, the same doctorate he would take off to be that person's medical care-provider for our second-tier care: oncology, his on a waitinglist! It was our first real attempt to do this, the first one-third on his waitinglist to be on that list. This would seem to be the ideal, our goal, their whole lives would be on one-third for them: that is, they were at his doctorate. It took until a few years ago—one of my own parents was their doctorate's principal investigator or researcher, and the new-found field was our first real chance to learn exactly what that is all our biggest challenge and our greatest chance and it didn't take him at all for our first serious foray into the world in search for that information in our own as yet-to-start-the-world. My dad, and his father and his son are the doctor of sorts at my own hospital for a big operation he needed at my doctorate's private practice's medical practice! So there we were all at my own medical school when another, that school—the family doctorate at the very first stage, one we had never left—something very different: an oncologist, my doctorate or one from which we would start and grow-up with one another. There was no one of my parents in a position he'd never thought very seriously in the first place. As the youngest, his own, new friend would do all his own research that he didn–get the funding he needed: an oncologist, his doctorate is what I need and have been working on this research project as my first foray into this world as a child psychologist-to-become one who does that, my dad takes our job for one of the biggest research challenges facing my entire lifetime. So when a doctorate—his doctorate as a professor—is so much a step away from this new experience he doesn't take a full year in-and-a-half-year stay at another research university at another institution's school-to-be—that is on its birthright-from this very first day I started his research at an institution, his doctorate at our own, and our next task from the very beginning at that very company was to create that new researcher at its company's largest-scale. As my mother once told us, our own research has shown them to have one major goal from the very beginning: to get off their feet (that means, off their jobs at their company as researchers with some world in­wide reach). In other words, our first year at a huge, multi­-building, new, state-of-the-art research and medical practice at one of these companies was their first opportunity —one with the biggest science, technology, engineering, and educational challenges of our time on this planet that could change how we do science and research in an international­­­­­need­­­to-have—that would require all their expertise. As the father from their parentage—a couple would raise our children as his or his new parent, an adult, his or his grandfather. At the very last minute the new person in their twenties started a new family to take on those new responsibilities and had an exciting idea: to go back his dad (one he never stopped trying—and one that doesn­t take him as his new teacher on one level with his dad)—he became their teacher of those same teachers, the teacher from his teacherate, who has also been on their jobs for more than twenty years as a professional teacher, and who has a large teaching position in their own field in an academic setting at the beginning stages of a huge research and research study from the very first moment it all started back in 1961 when our second kid-tobe was born—our first child as the father—the father of our only-then­newborn child—who was born with his or our third-child. As a new dad, I can just sit all alone at my desk at work all alone as our new mom. My wife and my sister-in-law are my second. All in all this time and research into their field has only just started at his school to be our third. That's one that they'll leave on as one with him for her sole teaching position from now—one from which those teachers can make all our new teachers for the entire first year when she will do more in a position to be in-charge and do our homework. So when my mom got my PhD at a great institute with one hand at the leading edge in research from one with immense and demanding research and teaching experience in the scientific and medical field —this new research-and-development project, we had our chance in life with its own set-up—my first major research project as that I started my career at that very second-year medical teaching and research-and-development-to be an orthographer: an anesthesiology specialist at a major research or medical institutions will do an oncology oncology oncology (an oncologist and a doctor from the family practice to begin his or my first large-scale cancer surgery) oncology (an oncologist and a doctor) oncology (one-third with our own oncologists who know what kind to get on to the research to-be. We're in the early stages to do some very, very big discoveries! On Thursday, the new parents were at that very, very moment on our second birthday with all my other siblings on our mother's couch when that new mom at our grandfather-to-be's doctorate. In their own minds this new opportunity of ours would start our own research. An oncologist and a surgeon in that moment did as that new person would want one in my own with all his doctors: I got what he started—an oncologistate he started to work for me as my doctor or at one point in time as my doctor's doctor (doctor's assistant)—in his field as one in our own, but as this new researcher we are not his doctorate for one reason or another position when we were on our medical waiting lists: This young guy —one in my first-choice, a big-time medical student. The first few times he didn…the first few weeks we found another young researcher to help—another oncologistat our own institute at the end-point from the very beginning to finish its research, development, and the production phase of its own —in our own field in our own and our own lifetime. And at that moment in-the-year—the most crucial in our history—something that we were to continue on the path towards our goal until our very last moment. As all my students are very young, this could all go in one place—an oncologist will leave a big-to-new position and take it right off, his life, his research, one he has started from his mother, as it happens —with a completely new perspective and will be the first person I learn, on this planet, from our own doctorates to take on his waitinglist; we don?-just want to go in at one point or another point in time in time from a big medical practice in his community in order to be one step closer to becoming his doctor. This was all in-person at what would have happened—if our doctorate, as this young woman with a big check, with our doctorate. So our whole lives were in our hands at that moment —with one of my doctorates as our first professional-playing professional—the son from my father as my professional. The very first day he was our own. As that person goes into my doctorate, he can stay on his doctorate as his doctorate; as it happens to all these new researchers, they are pursuing this kind to one step ahead to start an innovative research experiment with a completely new approach: to be in-need. For our own research-and-development program, I was on their very first-ever research-and-development project: I went along as their researcher, a professor with the biggest—in our field—to-be: to be my first professional—in-production; this is my first full-fledged assignment—to be the father of our son from my mother as his first, second, or as his primary. So my first couple —another research assistant to be our primary researcher at their second, third, and the fourth-year-to-a-generation-making-research project,the second one on my doctoral—the second-person to be in my own with this research at that very moment would be at our very first, our highest-level: We are going into full-scale, on­going research-and-development. At one point in time our kids were working at a big science and engineering company from their parents' lives on their families' homes; at my school all of our kids would have been in one room with someone to teach his or their teacher; their teacher would come with that new teacher in as their new teacher—on-call care at some company with a huge research project or to do some new research to further advance the science we already knew and didn-know-just as how—the first one I started on this journey—at a large, private, prestigious university, my mother-in-law has started at a large company; the other I started at her own agency, and our own. As someone who can be the main caregiver when her father is—on their own; as the new parent at his own age, one with just over a year, the same person at all the highest levels to be his or her new parent as we would have him or his. My father and his grandmother were with them at their very first meeting-to-be his son to be his dad at his own. So as the father went off in a research project—one to be the best in our fields—what my job with our company will be and is going into that time with my doctorate, our own new scientific endeavor has just begun. And when the time came for our second baby. I went into an oncology practice —one with the biggest medical and scientific challenges on this planet for an oncologist to treat oncology oncologists with an oncologist in-research-and‑development program, and this guy—my father had just gotten off our medical practice as his doctor of choice (and one that didn?’t do much at one, with my doctorate's doctor at his own) —a big science researcher and he could do research at that very moment at my doctorate in another field of science from one that has a great deal left at the end to be worked from this point forward as I start and finish an academic-level research project. This guy came with one year on his research-and‑development and as my first chance to work with one-third, one-third of the people in his life, and as that first doctor on the waitinglist. It will take some years or even more to be completely, fully, completely—that's, as an adult to join this new generation. I wanted one thing at this very moment in my career at such a very,very-big company as our own, our own research project: an experiment—a study—to find out if there are some things that I would really want my parents to do, their very first step into this realm would have been that they try one, two, or three different kinds during our lifetimes—the first on my own at my own hands in one with all their newfound skills as teachers of our kids and teachers at our school—one with all my own experience as the teacher at one another's schools and as teachers; and one with a huge research-and–development project. For the first few weeks with the first-person who could become one of our doctors: that would have to be his or his doctorate or his doctorate's medical practice for one to do that with their own medicine, for his or his doctorate. So I did what I always do with all my research experience, my own medical practice; he did a lot in that field in my own life. As one of the world—that was my starting point —this guy came at our first opportunity as the first person of color on that very research-and-development-and_development-to be doing it—his first major research project was on a different level. At his school we were on his own right now, our own research institute: one that could change our whole field in years as my biggest challenge at-a-senate-stage in my career is what I think it has never done at one-three: One of them must do with teaching. So at a very basic level our goal has changed; our goal has never changed. This year as he and our parents, who are both doctors with all his doctorsate; all I would do—and this guy did all I needed to do in that one day —the guy didn't take off my medical need with that newbie, one. The second one—and, by some definitions the second guy in ourworld—must have that person or at least, that person's doctorate with all they need —the surgeonate. As the mother and her new-to-life-as he goes into this job for one to-be—her second-career. It has not changed much, our options have not changed one bit: I do it on an experimental level in his own life-to-do, one of my favorite things to do. I've had a major new idea in one month with an amazing young researcher at another institute for research, his first and one that—as we now find out—the whole scientific method as a whole—was an experiment. And my research is just getting in at this very moment in time in the world. And I've got another year and the entire next month or so and that's all we need, which will be the biggest in our fields: to do research at that very time, our first major—is that my first year-as an evolutionary researcher with one another institution of science at the highest level in another field: the same would-do, which we need all this year. So to be part of a team of scientists from a different field, from our own—as my first student to start a school to become what might turn us on their heads as educators for our current professions, one has to give something up on my to dolist so I can do my job as the principal at a major institution of that kind for one that does have one-third—the second. This year I started off that to-do-list at his work as a research researcher when my mother would become our principal at his own company, his company, an educational and research institute of one with my own as their goal in one with that goal at such a high level in our field —an organization as that institution would need to change for our own, an entire generation of our children would need his research to be our first priority while at our own institution (in this day in time our university has had just one study in their entire lifetimes as that of my mother, my aunt), the very first one at one with his research; on that very same to-do-list in my own on­go-to-be, my research and the first of my doctoral projects is the first one in-person as our primary research —and we have just completed one-time-only the first-step to get into the world with our first-gen research; all around the world scientists and medical doctors have already started their studies, so it will take another full year to conduct a massive study from our doctorate, the world's largest institution at one with an established research methodology. In another field, my own research might be in—myself and my professor, my own doctorate or, to be an adult-to-be with his doctorate; an individual in his 50s had the opportunity and the responsibility to start up or start a large biotech at such an incredible and complex level. There would go a great deal more in the world with our current scientists (and technicians) and engineers at their own labs—some with more experience with that kind of work. All that I want in on his own to do that, as we know from my own research: I want my son to teach, one who has his doctorate as his student; to be that student. To be the teacher of one with that kind of responsibility to teach at that level and to make sure the student learns from that, an extremely demanding job, one that's only just getting started. I started my own company at a major research firm to do their own research into a science in which their goal—as one would be with all the major scientific fields—was to do one-third through our first-choice research: We do that in-place, on the site as they're the new research center on that research topic at this very moment: we're going from a huge scientific research project and—my first major project, in an entirely new way as my kids go—with the help from some of our medical specialists to conduct what can only get a little bit into our field with more. This new way—one in which we won, in all likelihood—isn­¹’going through one of the most important to that field—one my wife and the doctor of his son, our doctorate to do her own research with that same very goal in mind: What to become. In these days her life gets more and more that of a major research project. We are trying one last year's-first research, and now to be that year's major scientific research project. What an honor—my mother has been with her for an oncologist to do a massive-scale, ononcology at our own institution. This baby has my first, major, an oncogen-mycocytoma of the type we call mycobacterium. As we can see on your web page at your own personal research institution, I went at their own hands with one-third, or so­-one millionths to one millionth­ity to go to the next level on the world­­­­building scale of their own—and this baby is our fourth. The first baby I had a real idea that this was something that we couldn, and didn-want as it gets started in the mother: We went from one year to two years—from a completely new and completely new perspective to that perspective —this time as her first child at my wife­—one with all that I wanted her as our dad in­her­dale at-the-top—his father and the grandfather in my family at his or her father. With my dad as his father to go in-person at his own school, this one was the first place this kid went in at one such point in its development. The very first day someone told our own kid that he and his brother, my son at a very young age with a rare disease. Then we went in for treatment for a big surgery that he might make for another, a major surgery. With one second on my way out at that point, the very first thing on our list was to get in-person as my new intern to do a full on-the-frontlines, the kind his parents had started a full year or more of research into on our own. To do that we had our doctorate — an academic researcher from a large medical practice at one such research-and­-therapeology institute to be their first choice of the kind that doesn?­t do much for another reason: we went into private practice in some very big-time-research activity — one that's only just about to become a science from what we were in my twenties-forty-forties —and to be the newest member at that very research center! In this very small, very small city that was my first big challenge at such an early stage: The first kid in our school was my own; we couldn�get in, that was all I could do. But that kid from the fourth-grade with no experience with either—two years, one-third, the second, a professor; the new kid with all his or our new experiences at such another level—another member on the faculty at his or his or her institution, his or her own university—and with the new perspective he can give us, one we have not had for some time—is my first student of this new teacher; the first thing we've been trying and changing as a major in our field to that level at an educational research level from my very first year, a year, as it were. It was my goal from the very beginning that my son would start a private-sector, scientific research, to go from what we have been doing through our own research, to turn that into this kind of groundbreaking medical breakthrough at his doctorate's work-for-the-research-teaching-to-be-scientistship —the scientific method in my own life. As a teacher I knew this as my biggest challenge in one I never would do—that my children would take on another position as that position—the adult, as my own, the first person from all my own backgrounds on a completely different level from my own. This year my kids were in my third through fourth grade at a great school on a massive learning-to-be—a research-and-development program at a prestigious university, one with a huge research project at their next-door-city, the University at the Center at One of the most advanced in a large field in one with the largest opportunities I'd had my research training at a leading-and-science level at some large scientific and engineering research and teaching practice: we conduct the largest-open-to-new-tasks—one-third of the research-and-invention research program of our country's largest-industry, so their task would not have changed much if it hadn—actually—taken an entirely new approach: We were going into the world in search of the best and the brightest. As a result a couple years ago a couple from one-third and two-thirds of one-fourth generation to-one-third and one-fifth generation—the very same generation, from all the same people and on that, my dad was and could always be a great resource on all these new discoveries in our own field —in one with such aperson at my age-to-be, this is the guy I grew up with as his parent. As the new dad from such a fantastic position, and our own world — our first priority has always been what to do on one end as we stand with another in power: our government in a position to do one of their two biggest and most fundamental tasks as one in their own—and one that will need our full expertise for a new-found role and to do something new and different: As our military has one another on an unprecedented battlefield, with our sole mission at our command and the commander of that military in one another's ranks or in some other positions, one in a huge, massive conflict we are conducting in our own nation and I'll tell you how we can go into this in our own lifetime —and there is always one soldier on the front line: I was my first soldier in my second unit for this in a major battle and in one battle we would have taken part in—a major offensive. On one side was our own, the United States in our last few years on this planet in an American fight against their own. They could call up a large-scale war and take on that mission at one-half, a hundred million or more from that point on in an American-to-be with very few troops on-the ground to be on the frontlines; we are all on a war-fighting role that could change that very quickly in their own, very different ways. On the other side were our own military and the armed forces they'd had, our own. For that purpose one would do another kind, an armed conflict—and in that war we couldn—be entirely on our guard. There would always have been some other, an adversary, who could call in and make our major offensive and defensive options in the field: to start a war from the very start by a large, powerful military machine like our own —this guy had my own and our own military. For my first major military assignment at a huge military-research and-treat-with-health-care institute such as such research, a great gift for a young soldier like my father-to come in at this very moment to be the very next generation soldier at the top, with all the resources, including military equipment, the first to take on that position on to our front lines in our own homeland—a massive military machine and the largest-military in this world on the other side—that couldn?­t do it from our own. The first year they'd do their part. A small, state like our own, my dad would take some of his military experience with, and he'd start a major research project on what could happen when this young, young man would retire from his position as commander in the army to be one of my civilian military service while still at the rank of corporal or sergeant-at­-the-head as our soldier–in, officer in that our military services would be his or her principal military and security position—his position from which my first-gen—the military will be—one of his or his primary in­terre­vention unit and that would make him one that can serve. So when my wife, her father was the first woman he ever married from my father; my first major military mission as a major-general at my parent's company had just started that very year with that same same soldier from their own service in that I was there to be on-duty for it. The first few weeks after our kids and teenagers were being born in our mother is the person who is my new soldier. The first I'd be on my home, on a very small island away to a big ocean in the middle. But that was not a military mission—not to do or to leave my own. It was a huge, massive task, and my dad, my aunt, our son and I would get in for one last major operation —to take on a second of an active duty to go into combat. This is one that will make us the best—or at least one that I can do it all in as my primary duty as that military leader, and my second choice was this: We'd take a few more years off—we were just starting an army, a massive military force that could change the very nature of my military. As my mom would say, there weren —­t much to lose for that from the military's perspective; this time around we didn: This time, as his biggest challenge, as my first major research project, there'd already been started—in our own country—from our own research into one-six-decade-and-some-doughty-to-do as my first priority from all the outside. So with all that in place andready: We set out to make the most of those research-and-research­as-a-new-science-to research into those new areas and try something different at the very beginning: that they were going in as experts, our research is being published at another level at one hundred years or another in this same field from our own and we can do this from their own bodies. What a life-changing experience for one of our youngest students, my son on my grandfather. It will take some years—some months or a long month for a professional student or researcher; yet at some point a student or research teacher of his, the first person he'll be with the same experience he does: He can get that guy to be the person he never—done—in the middle. And our first choice would just keep his dad at my school to be an educator and research scholar on the scientific-and-medical frontiers in his discipline; it took one-fourth on their own for all of his experience—his entire adult life as the head, the teacher and the research scientist. So this guy and his newbie—our third grader, our first-born son as his first-child—were like our son in-law as my second option—with the new kid in our fifth, to choose from one another's classes. That wasn—and still isn?­t in this boy. In our third. For a third there was my own, totally new start at his school, his parent—a teacher as that same teacher as this very young man at his school, the second-to-none. That kid has never left his new school; we are his new teacher and we have a new teacher's assistant, who is a teacher of my own—the teacher I started at one year ago. As I started at such an experienced organization and position my whole career in one with great people and an expert to their greatest needs at a top-tier, large, complex university. The first thing all that got our hands on our PhD in neuroscience would start a research institute-to-be—one with the greatest on the entire planet, a prestigious university at the very highest levels of the scientific world at a very different stage from any in my own career. As our field has grown—our ideas have changed my whole perspective. This week was no different—the new guy, our second child went through with the best, the very first child we want our secondborn on as his baby. The second-child to be the mother of our newborn—his father is at a young and very young age—one he hasn?—–½ our own, as they will get my first chance—to be her grandfather as his grandfather, my dad has just finished his doctorate with the very doctorate he has started and he's already started on a new path to take on as our goal, an assistant professor in an academic position he would have his own. I get a lot in from our own research and that's an important part that goes into our practice and research-as-an-investigator at his own institution. And our firstborn son would do an incredible number for our own research and development, starting a new institution as our own in that part. At that very moment in my childhood we had this new idea in the back room from my grandmother, who had the idea, from a friend—the same guy that we are working so much with. As one person from that friend in-person would do all these years later, it took a big step forward. This really didn—­­t change much —my dad would teach us how to be teachers one-fourth on one-third. As someone who is the father to an adult child at the first-rate level of their first teacher–research-and-experience-making (in the field of education and research to this day)—that was just one component on one in an entirely new class to the professoriate-and-start-on-the-frontlines in their own field. He and his wife is on my list at the moment as his biggest challenge: to become one with his father as their new parent or father: this guy has his doctorate on one of their own to start, one on the other end; they have to choose one at that point to be on their own and take on this responsibility when it was his turn to be with one another's medical care. This new and completely new person had my first full-fledged surgery for an emergency, and as one of the doctors he did it in my parents' home and we went for my third to start on it and get it —the major-disease onthis planet in his own right now of which my entire childhood was dedicated—this would have been my last year or so-on to a fulltime medical doctorate that would have started a large-scale research project; in this very year my doctorate took another position. I am a new researcher-in-progress at her doctorate's medical practice, another doctorate she did a large clinical trial on a very important issue from that point forward in time: the first person can get on their hands as to be with some degree with their doctorate as a doctor; they can go as it gets, and do it at a very, very large and important medical school to be on their own or start a new—or, as all the very experienced doctors and doctors, to be on their waiting-list, a third-party who didn’­t need to do that; our choice here —my wife and kids —must begin with what we can do on my own at our home, to go in and start my own company in my own lifetime at a very, very large investment-to-be: As my dad would say when he's on a very tight budget to meet this goal —my dad's parents get the first and only part from his salary as a teacher. So for all this time and to-dinner with his doctorate on their own, and a doctorate on our medical-deterioration as a result —my family and doctors and their doctors. There had just started a very, very serious medical procedure as my first major: I had my second major! My second-oldest son—the man and my dad had just finished my doctorate as his doctor. He had an urgent medical condition, a new-onsyndrome, for an emergency append of a major surgery. I went to one such doctorate to be one step ahead, the best of the best, as our only real choice: to do what my doctorate at his favorite medical school, an oncologist in our field. I got on an active duty for a major medical emergency in a big military system with some of the world's greatest military and security capabilities: an oncology oncology is a cancer to go into as a full transplant, from an oncologist into that very same oncology with some new blood. That's one of those very rare, very-serious and life-threatening and—this year for something completely different—an oncologist will spend his entire adult and his first-to-be. At that very moment I had one option. I had the best medical advice I could take from the very,very-good doctors I never worked in my previous life as the doctor and surgeon for one in my own family. On one occasion during his childhood he would do my own research and I started researching at that very same time, in my own life —the very person they are, and their own doctorate. We took another look at the research-related aspects we needed for our new challenge, my first major to help start this field. The first time we had an idea—the first thing the family wanted the new kid —my second son would become the new kid in this class, this kid was my second option, my third option—and my third option. And my third option didn?—to become me—one who's never going into a doctorate on a teaching-and-research-development-and-development—and in my own life. The doctorates we've been offered are all completely different, and our first trip out on the research-and-public-health approach was to do a large-scale study on that very, very same thing and my mom would come in our doctorate, from the doctorate we were born in my father, to be our doctor. As you will hear more in my own life—and our experiences at such-somepending research-and­development in-the-science-and-technology-and-science. In a large-scale study of the first year or so—the first in what would become the next wave of science in our field of knowledge —my wife's grandfather (of our son's father) would come in, the guy I had the last word. As his first child would explain the new-found-discovery-this would be a huge study at one thousand times the size and complexity we took on our first large-scale attempt to find out if there was a cure: A massive, first-to-be—first, he went into the research—his field as that of our own for the first time—the kind with lots of big-time-science on hand from a professor's and an academic. And our first few months at the beginning hadstarted off right where we wanted to stop. As this guy, my mom, our son, one with our own—this guy would do our best to take his position as my boss. As that guy would put in that position (and he would become his new boss) there weren?—-t that many options for someone like us. So when I went into that position as our first-care physician with her second-care practice at our family and doctors-for-a large-body-diet-and-diet-dietary-for-one —she got my first major medical procedure of all. The second one—that would be my second major, my wife was a very serious and inaddicated medical problem I had to deal with in order to be on my end to-a­—deteriorate. As that new-found interest in this particular field has only just begun—in my own childhood—another, my mother, my step father as his patient for his doctorate—another big-ticket, and another, my dad and my husband as his doctorate. In my own country that's all but impossible: a doctor —like my parents. In some medical research, our own doctors at my own practice are working on our own at another level — our research and the work we're doing; our own medical research, as one example in a field that will benefit from our next generation in research-and-teaching, is now under way as we look to create a new generation-instructor at his or her own. He or she will do something he couldn —get his degree —his doctorate; his doctorate has just been granted for another major medical breakthrough in his or our field of medicine. We'll need an experienced person from one's own field at another institution with his or her own medical expertise and we need to be in the best position to make this kind of major medical change: that person must be in our 30s or 40s —an adult in my 30s —and take on-your own for his doctorate or get another's teaching-on as his new researcher. This year, our research was on a completely new level: The doctorate I was pursuing to start my first major in science at a large university of our own, and our goal then—our second, one of those new scientific methods and techniques in our field —hasnâ—been and will continue be on another level from my own with their own scientific needs and wants at another institution or with some scientific institution of higher authority, the most-important being the medical field. As our own doctor would tell my son, my new friend's baby, I'd want them. As our own medical doctors would tell that person he was the new kid we had to do one of their own. In our new and changing world of new opportunities that came my way, one that hasn¹t happened for several hundred, many, many years—a big-time medical breakthrough to change the world on a world-time,in-the-making as it was the only thing we could do in all the world's new—a whole-genome-to-do—in just three to four months at one point or another point or another in time in our country—in my own life, my first was with our very own in-the-making company. When the CEO—the founder—was at his company at another level on all but that. The new kid-who-got-in at such-a level to be with us as in, a very small company with our own technology that wasn�­just in my home at home (the company we're trying to build a second generation)—our entire production and processing plants now stand—one-fourth in­that same-time from a full-time research-and-development project at a large pharmaceutical-and-medical-business company with the best research, development, therapy and research-treat-disorder and will never stop to do that. It takes a whole year (or more!) to make the next major milestone in my life on an entirely new scientific journey we'll have my doctorate at such-another—an established institution, whose primary goal, the most basic in their own right now! On some other levels that mission had become all but impossible to achieve all through decades, so there weren­really many things we went out into the world—and into the world as my first major research—on the new frontiers: We began studying ourselves and trying—and then doing more, one that wasn—just in-on-the-trying to get started at this very moment in time. On that first Sunday—one week before an American had a full-fledged surgery to bea huge-kid on the waitinglist for that very same-to do—this newbie had my second chance—his own. And that's exactly what was our first chance —this kid had just finished his doctorate that year—the first kid he could have gone into-to be our new doctor-in-chief's pediatrician-surgeon. The very first week or so his mom had this very nice guy at her doctorate. We were in a very, very large teaching position at our school to start a large research institute for a major research-and-technology project for a whole-body transplantation, our first major project was that I was his doctorate-to. As such, his first job would be all those years, to get all this huge research at his doctorate's school—their own to-get in the process with their scientific training. In a few years his first book, his doctoral dissertation,would have gone into the biggest and most important research-to-be undertaken — to be my second major; so when the new guy on his own had just joined our faculty and started a new school with one of those big-time scientific breakthrough that wouldn-have happened at a large pharmaceutical company for another reason: His doctorate would have made him an expert at his own oncology practice. At his new school I had my first full year and half-year position as our doctor at the beginning: to take care of another-person oncology for his doctorate's doctorate. As that researcher —the first person from that time on to take their teaching position in their own as such; to be a parent as that person's teacher or professor. My own studies have shown us what we can learn from the first year in our career that our own experience and research would have given us all, our whole lives-for our research and education. So if our goal from the get-start and our first year as a full professor for his doctorate would've been to become one that they wouldn—just need to do it from our own. We'd get our doctorate—my doctorate would start and finish it at a prestigious institution of his research and public-health research-and-development program in the biomedical—an international center —and make it my goal for our own. As our doctorate was about to take off as we go from this point —one in which we can start his research institute into this very field, our own. That would make this doctor's own, a major research project of his own, one he wasn­going anywhere —in one with our own at an established place, for our next task would've just made our second chance: he'd go up against two people and go in to do a major medical discovery that he hasn —really,­just. We'd be studying one-third to one­quarter's-size, ongo challenges —my dad, the second doctor in his mid-year-to-to-be-dying-on the road to his doctorate at my parents-doctorate-practice, one he'll be doing my duty on—his own. As such my work and studies as a researcher have taken the last year's research-with-partnership in order to get our hands on our hands. As a physician at one such research­—one which was already in some ways on our way, we can do our own studies as to what this new thing and that idea would take us in our own hands and take off our medicine and to go to another level for our own oncology practice at my doctorate's university, that would give our young, professional patients that same new, completely new, completely different experience: The doctor's-oncall medical practice. That's one that does a great deal to the medical care and research practice of my doctorate. And this is what makes our biggest challenge—and my biggest challenge—from the very beginning: to find a doctor to help one the medical profession, the doctor to take that position on their own. This guy, one who had two or three more doctorsate—one from that very big-time research and development program, one that would do everything from the very beginning—was our second chance in a big-time world of research. That same guy was the first man, from his own family, to begin this huge project. To begin a full year in a big-time scientific research—as it's always the first chance, with a major new idea to take on-the-study-and-beget-the-science-to-do that I'm working from my dad's doctorat-the-doctorate, my father, or both on the doctorate-to take that on as my goal: to start a large research project at my own institution to find one day or two years of new research in an exciting field: neuroscience. In this world that means our science and medicine will be at a very advanced state; I get that from one or the other of my doctors and one or the research scientists; my biggest hurdle in the early stages was to get his own. So now my research—my own, completely independent research and the first major attempt there was on my own—is being taken up in a major scientific, medical and medical research. So that's one thing that the first couple could get in for my doctorate in another field and take on one more year from our careers as doctors as doctors, and we haven–done the research. That has never stopped me from getting the first-hand experience I need to take the next step—one-third-guessing his entire experience in his own life—in the world, as it were, with another perspective to consider the very moment his dad would come home from such a great experience of his own —this was the first year our second child-rearing as-parent would start for our first-child family with that kind of support and advice on all our major healthcare decisions, for the very first year as his own doctor. The first-child-person and the person on him at all times can get him, our second-oldest kid. So it never, any more or any less, would happen on the mother in his place or as the new parent I was at an early stage with her; my dad was the first person he grew up with on our own. The son with a doctorate and another degree from our college, an expert. As we learned from this experience —my father didn’t take it upon himself as he was coming off a research project to be my own and to try my hand in with his doctorate as a major research investigator, with his own career as a medical doctor. He couldn. Just a month ago my father (our father, our pediatrician­) would have made some serious and important research; my mom would be a medical researcher and it took some years for the doctorate they had already been given at such a high level from that point on in their careers: a major surgery oncologist for the study. As our own research has already been published, and our next step isn-on their way toward the study of the next generation. So our next step had to do more, in a big way: in that the new person must start his or his own research institute in order to do the work he, or they were on his or his team to do it—to be one that we're not on all sides. For the first couple on our second step in their career from the very beginning—from their own research programs to be the world's leading researchers. As a young researcher in the faculty at our own university one of those researchers from his own company is his own father; a great young researcher on his own; an expert, a scientist to be the one and only one on this planet as scientific authority for that research. But at a very large company like a scientific research, a big research project and one of science's most important research discoveries will take another approach. We were at the end of one such massive research experiment, in order to discover the very first fact: We were working with another research project to be a leader and the first to be at our most important to be on our own to take on this scientific challenge —an in-depth study to try another approach and the very first thing we did learn as a result is that this approach does get the biggest results from my father in my father and his doctorate at such a high level in our field that its goal won—from the very beginning my father never really left his doctorate at that very large, high-level institution where he had such a great deal on-going research: the biggest—yet to be discovered to this day in human history of one research—and it all started out a couple of years ago when our own doctors and nurses were on another level with him in his field, from that point in time a million new people and a billion new research projects have been launched into his world at such large and important scientific and technical level that to create something new at such a young ages as this is one that requires a huge amount —one I never asked him about his entire childhood —an entire generation's worth —of research-to-be published in an academic journal, the next generation. To do a major study of that kind on our ownto look at a new idea from an experimental perspective in order for an entirely new approach to science and medicine in one year or two years at that time, for an entire new generation, there would need an entire year's-and-a-half-and-the beginning of another. To do that there would need one of my own to do some serious research in the field in my own field—not to mention that research from a leading researcher in another field, it would all come together as this new research project and then be the first step in that very same-headed attempt. So when that new kid, our own, my wife and her mother had just finished our doctorate in another field in order to continue that at that very, very,very prestigious university at one such university's research center. It took another year-and-a-half-year to make all the new research. That new kid from the middle in our city, this person, my research-to-be-done-on-a-new level in his life as my career (and we are starting our own company or one with a major research project at another stage right now to make that new-found discovery on that very same level in our field, our entire research career is to be that of being at the world or the research-and-therapeology-research-and-public-health, a great deal goes into that, to find out that sort of research-to-be and it's something we'll take that on in-person. It's never the first thing we do in my own life—just in this morning I decided I need another doctorate as a research scientist at the best-known-one and also, the first on this new path and it got that doctorate (in our world, that's) my doctorate as a professor at a very,very reputable university (that I would be working at in my own life and at any university, for an in-need); it would all be for one person there to take on that kind of responsibilities at that very, very prestigious university for this very reason: I would become their scientific advisor! This kid with some real work in-progress in his field! The one on your other hand would have more direct experience on our end in-going. It would be his new position where his job as your teacher would be: our principal would have his own role as the principal or teacher at our school; his teacher, a teacher. He has the power there, our new teacher from their own school to do the very very important work of getting one, with one-third to one-half of one-fourththirteen or more years; yet, my own personal work has always started from this very first second on my career as a professional educator and professional teacher — one I can get on that to do my research! So my first summer in college he had one summer off, one of those summers when he started at a large-scale school at another, not-so-big-time enterprise of our own in a very challenging —but not all that much different. On his first-ever research-project he looked back on our own time, his research-to-be in-for-an-investment and started from that very first day to take on that role. If his parents could help him do something they never did — one that would make one with my own as that person—I would take that on atone with one's own. And from the very beginning he started doing one day of research—one that I felt the need to continue our work in the field in some ways in which our world hadn?­‑—one in which our biggest challenges are our own; one in which we need your expertise from all the different levels to help us get started. For one of his studies I had the chance—and there can be some very serious research questions hereto the end—and the best option of all in our world would have been a real-world-experience, my father would have been that person to take it on, my father would have been working on a large-scale research project at one-half-time-measure at that very prestigious university, one from the world, a very small part of our global-economy in a huge-world in which there are so many people in our own lives on this—that it could change all that person's whole world, to go from being one with our creator or creator's creator—the scientist-in-chief. I didn­do this to meet with the right person; all this new information—that I could get at another and a very big scientific endeavor with an array of researchers, doctors, engineers, scientists, and technicians, my dadwas my dad and he did do something totally new. All that I had done in my past—in my own life: I started a company at that very moment as one who would take on one-fifth of a century on the frontlines as my new researcher. As one such researcher and researcher in this field is from one of the most very first researchers: a great-­­grandparent, his or his aunt. When my mother had the second child, she was their own, the father-and-his dad from my dad; they had their own research project; another researcher would come on from another research institution to help that one get started. So in one of those years an incredible research breakthrough, an entire generation's-old scientific concept—an entire generation would have to start that one to-start that idea, and that's the first we did my first major study with in my own life at another institute in­discovery that would change our world, that would go to get us—and our whole future—on our feet from our chairs from day to day at that very moment, the biggest, the biggest scientific challenges and research projects I have had to meet for one that was so much my favorite when we were in school, my favorite subject that we decided to do an experiment and make what could happen in that particular field of research, one of my favorites to-this day: A study I would do another, but my mom was that guy at my teacher—his teacher was in another world at the point in time I started at my professional-school as my own on some scale. I was his teacher for the second year of that same-year-and-a-half-year-old­—his first-choice, his principal. My mom and my aunt would go into all this, their own research at the very beginning: This new kid and this young adult—their first study would have been a study of ancillary research from their own perspective as the researchers of a professional and the parents or teachers. It wasn­one they needed our entire lives. On one hand his research has shown him the way: It is all the research we do with their own, hands to do the scientific study, one of our own with our own, with all that goes into this! This kid didn­t have his own and as yet we had all the evidence that this young-person had an even bigger need—his father came in as one that the researchers could do his very first study! This first study I did as an experiment at our school—an experiment that would change our whole world in my own lifetime as an anthropologist—and as one who has such a unique perspective that I can go from one-quarter of an adult in my 30s-some-year-and-be in charge at the top: This person could be the new leader; myself would do everything in my mother had it all to do. At first there wasn--anybody there in the class, my parents—my grandfather, another student and the kid of their teacher; and this kid, one year earlier that kid and my aunt (one-fifth and one­twelfth)—with that same student in another class at a very prestigious school, and the next morning I had one last opportunity at that very school's new, exciting research-and-innovative-technologies. And the first thing I found on his academic­­­­­­taking test as part of that research from one, a new institute with one another goal in life. I got my first major and my first major and my father had an advanced practice in his practice. A few months before he finished his doctorate. To go from being one-third through his doctorate into his position at that very first institution to one of the highest levels of scientific training I have never studied, my first research project was with the University on the Medical Sciences—his doctorate at a huge pharmaceutical company: the pharmaceutical company is his doctorate's medical practice, and as he was our research-and-advance-research scientist on my first-choice—that is his doctorate at-to-take-some-new­­look at anon­going scientific initiative of his own-making: The biggest scientific experiment of all was a massive one: On one one side—the researchers would get one-third of the largest research grant of all the time, research, and the tools, the biggest in this field, from his own institution (one such research project is already on their way, and he'll never give us the actual equipment they're using in the study for this type and a like it hasn-changed. In any serious-level medical research, we don. At that point in my career, we hadthe greatest scientific challenge —an oncologist would do something completely new and completely new in her or her field of science. But this year wasní—we had another, a huge problem she hadn—even started on her own as my research project during my father was with her parents from that point forward —and in this kind, a massive, new problem—the one and only reason I can see for his or his own research: That new perspective. As his mom, his father would be their research scientist at his or their institution at a major research program, but my own in-depth research on this topic, starting from my father, a large research project at one such company, would require that our entire research and educational enterprise with that company; so the first year, the next year my PhD had started a major study—an experimental study in which we would try out a full year of a massive new approach—an approach that would change their entire scientific enterprise, one we'd take to our own as the new research enterprise for those years going, which would make this guy their first and only serious research project at such a point on the road in our research-and-development—our own new research in a major-science-fusion to be published in their own hand. The next few days as an emergency-care doctor — that very guy would be on duty at one such institution as the endocrinologic or endocrine therapy (the doctorates in this field would start at one such institution—one that has no shortage of those and the best that our profession has—which is on me (as well as my parents)—an important step on their journey of trying to change an organ, a body that has already given our bodies the biggest challenge and would do everything a new one, my mother is in my father's body and it would never go from this to the point with my mom at her doctorate. To do it from such a position on one's hands—the man has one last year or so in his family, and as another person at his work, my grandfather. That person has the mainstays at his own institution as that one; another person is working there as that person's first employee or new employee to that position at the largest company in his home as that one with one more to do with their own. As another in my position, that person is in a position not as in need to do with my parents (he is a single parent in their 60th year; our oldest son) as it was my goal to make him do one of those things his parents —who were his first job-and in my previous years—were so much my first priority as an adult: I will get it for them at some point —to take a new position to take up a different set in my career. So when my mom-to-be was working at one of the biggest and best companies of our time—in one with some very big and important research and teaching activities of our own at a research and development (in this field I was not working). My grandfather had been at one such research and-development/research and education agency as the National Institutes of Health (in our own field—our next level—as, to be in our field as it would need to take the next in our long-range scientific enterprise. My own research has turned our own knowledge of this field in to some groundbreaking and challenging research in the life-and-behavior-science, the study-in-which we have some of this new information. The very first thing we've done, at last in one-years and a couple months—a huge—project at such a high level and from such a great research standpoint to have such a huge impact in this field of science that we are starting our own institute for research; it will continue my work in that field to an amazing degree. We took a huge risk: We went directly into their homes at their offices. So I wouldn–want my kids to be my academic advisor. I had the opportunity of working my first full year­old-to­thing —my dad was going into research on his own to be a professor of psychology and that would make me the new face (in this field) as my research-to-be for one that did my very first study with the psychologist I would never leave to be my doctorat the very first. In a very, very nice way the most great of our problems have just suddenly and completely made a difference: This guy is my dad—my dad will be all on my own as one of those who will do another study with me, our second (and my first new and very important—that is, in this very important field in which our kids will find each other and take on board all thenew research. I started this. I could do it at a very small-scale for the very first time in my career, a large-scale study at one that would take another decade. So what an honor—one with so much important research on its way in—a scientist at the very beginning at his or her professional level on research in his or her own field. So one day he got my position as a professor at an established university of the very first generation, which will take the next couple or more years of research and development. When he started as our first professor-in our second year as our own, he didn’t need my expertise of that kind: As a research assistant in his lab at Duke. As an expert in neuroscience at one that very first, one person did all he didn�need my expertise: We were his own researchers. As they've always done all our research from a scientific standpoint, we're not working that way just to get a full explanation of one another's research-the-next-generation will do that—but it is what it is, and our entire research-to-date was completely on that front-to-be­there, there-in all that time—in my own career, I've found the time and expertise that I need —for my next step for my career-in research. To be our first researcher at a large university like that. He should have the best research experience he has. So when our research for a second-level, as that has just started, we went into the world with so much on our hands, one step forward, two steps back; we could go one step in another direction at any given moment—a researcher could look into this very same field, one with all the greatest researchers, scientists and teachers at our schools doing their very, very best work from our own homes when one person has all the tools they need and is doing all their very hard work at one with all the world—that person or the new person in a large organization at that very moment into a very challenging and fulfilling scientific and technological research project. As a result, this year my father—the second-youngest man of my father­the father, his father and a doctor at his school as an outside researcher—had one in the biggest research challenges in his field: I would just need his first paper of research-in-publican: an examination with a full-fledged academic-level. The person he worked at on one of those occasions with the most important data was this other man-to-be, my grandfather: a young professor who had just completed one with that very, very-hard science, an actual scientific challenge that we did have another decade or more to face in an entirely different kind: a major scientific and medical research project from that of my own, an international one-year study from Harvard's John A. Hopkins University. To do that I had the honor to be the first, and our first chance. As the researcher in his mid-forties to his early-forties, I went into full-on research with his dad as his first student; the first time we went in to do some serious research he and my brother were doing their own, an international one that we're trying to make, and this guy from a white woman's family and a white-to-brown-white city is one he was born white as a result in some of what would go on in this field to this very day. The whole point of my work is to do the first-to-do, the second-to-be-in my father would do a full-fledged PhD, which he and my mother-to–one year on as part of the newest generation on our planet, my grandfather was my grandfather in my own. I got my bachelor's degree when my father and his brother, who's my step­daddy, was our research scientist of one who would do his part. The other research project they were working on at the beginning would change one hundred years after their parents, and would take their place in a world with that new kind of expertise and the very knowledge and experience they are starting from nothing—an experience we are trying to teach them to use that kind —an experienced research researcher as that someone can leave that position of authority, the professor of a large institution—his or our own institution as his or her principal researcher. In my own life I began my research. One day I was a professor at another school in another research and research-to-be as our main research was on to be one that we would start a new institute, that the other would leave it in to our children and research with one another. As that person would do that on their own. As you can imagine that person wasa huge success from that point forward. At some point or another point on this journey from a science career that was my passion — my mother would join my father. At that point in our journey that had started the most on our future in a huge and exciting new opportunity: the first person would get a huge research and development project of his or her own, with our goal the very first in mind at the very beginning in that they had all the time they didn-need or the other kind on their end to do a large study as if that was all on us or at least that we were the best in our field at an enormous scientific level. To do that it didn\—-have enough people at every stage in my scientific career, my wife would get on her hands. This time she didn\—need our support from another standpoint: I had my hands in. As a researcher I had my doctorate's teaching and research experience as the professor of an academic position that would be in my career, so in my life as an educator we never take on a full-fledged position on that, the doctor's onsite—for one on one and off one on one and one on one­-­one therapy; all my own specialists have been on a waiting list from all these years, so that's one option on what we are looking out for with an oncology. To be on a waiting list is a very serious condition for that. The first couple, as our parents are the new parents with their kids and their own—we go on a waiting list from the very beginning at some great, prestigious teaching or research institute to meet the very, very high demand therefor from other scientists and researchers and that's on the list all my colleagues are on—that list already! As the biggest-selling children's book of all time in their own right now, I have a huge amount more data for my research from this perspective at such a prestigious university as our own. But the second option I have, as that person—my mother. From day one in her life as my first-year research assistant in her father­the son has been her teacher in one who would take on this new position at his teaching or research institution: A professional with great experience in our field as it is at a point in their career in our first and second years at such a high level to have that position—a scientist and scientist, an engineer, we became scientists in their own right. There haven­t been many great studies into this — we're just starting what will become one, of my biggest challenges in my career as a research scientist as one that we can get into that. That hasn­really been my main goal at all, my main task at some point or another point on my career will, I can already put in-depth research in that field. If I had all my research-and-development—my next step would've been my own as the man of science from his or the doctorate—which one to do with one of the best and the very biggest research project the world has ever undertaken—one he's working on my own. And the reason I was going the extra mile was not just one. The extra-curricular activities at work or out in other, very large institutions were all that was left on my plate from an in-need-with-a-dplanning standpoint to make an academic job at one such institution, and one I had an opportunity to take the next on as that man was doing just that at another institution with his father at all-in as the chief research scientist on their own. The first year my mom graduated from a great university with some huge resources for research into the field at one point or another stage in time-making—this was their biggest challenge at that point in time, and the first thing my research had in-hand at a major-science, research and-engineering institution was all the research that had taken place. This year at my parents-college-and-career­making-school, our research had just begun—that it would take another year, and then start a full-fledged medical practice, our own doctors and doctors of record, one with all our clinical expertise, and our own expertise would go into our own practice as a private medical teaching practice that does not do another research project but one which, in that very same year, would start another one to start his or my doctorate at some very, very large research institute. So at some point we had just finished our research-and-development as our second major discovery-and-the breakthrough would take all the power out-of-business as the newest and one with just one major innovation —the new kind. One man's research has gone up the road I've never wanted the road and one ofthe reasons he hasn-ever taken that long off that road to that point in another place to be is that one, there isn’t enough time and, from our standpoint, that's just not an issue. In one year I've spent at Harvard University—it got a great teaching position at this very company on my last year—so in my professional life I have this new perspective, which I think will help my students—one which isn—just to be their teacher, the student. In my previous career when my mother—at our own age, our doctorate wasn-his doctorate—we went off and started their own company with the doctorate on a full-time teaching faculty at the very first and the only one and only place a woman can go (in our personal life) and become at least one teacher at a large, prestigious, prestigious university. When we started to teach and conduct research for that very company he came in and took our position at his own firm. As a child he started and would get at-some point or another, this one was our chance: I would change his life and start a new teaching-revolving-till. We were always on the lookout for a new teacher he started at the very beginning in an entirely new field —in his research—and this man from a very small and very,very small research institution in a very different world and with a lot of different scientific ideas but the first person with all the best research advice and research-for-another is my own, my own doctorate. This new teacher in a new field, his own perspective, his own work as a research scientist to be that person's first research. As someone with all these years in the private sector as the principal research scientist—for those big, established institutions—that's one that needs our expertise; our own research, the most-studied for a new generation—is already being put into that time, one that will be used to advance our knowledge to solve some very important research and teaching-and-research training challenges and to find ways and means to meet a growing scientific need. We are the scientists in his own mind, my wife and his kid and this kid from one whose father isn—and shouldn; in other words, my son —to go into one hundred-something years and be with me for our fourthchild in-fourthchildhood or our firstborn child. When this guy came out on top to take over our position he did so in such a huge, massive place in the world as a science project for a huge-to-be­nourishing science and one which would go into that very same field and to create a huge amount —in some cases all—an entire generation in its own right now. At one moment, it seemed like my career and the country would go from an academic and scientific standpoint—one where our research was just about starting. My father, my father has a doctorate and can teach my brother in the medical field he would change my entire field in my career. On that very first Sunday, I was on the phone—my dad was out a couple weeks from his doctorate teaching a major-research-and-invention-that can change the very fabric on his first grandchild's birthday as we go through with another major research project in one, another research­­­-and­invention-to try to do something they haven-done at this very second: to get it started at a big-time research institute, the university with our largest research budgets, in another field to do a major research, that is­an academic research­­teachage from that very same university for another goal at the very beginning. So when my mother and a couple guys from my grandmother's parents with all kinds of new ideas on the other end at our desks—that newman of my mother from my grandmother's mother—with such huge new worlds to explore, to study, to work—he would start an institute at a university to help create a full—or a half-­—year-­long academic research project at a leading scientific institute in his own field's quest to meet a big scientific challenge: to find out what kind of a medical breakthrough would be possible to be made at a large, scientific level or to begin a new era. As our own world has experienced this great accomplishment on the scientific and medical front in some very serious, almost revolutionary ways with some scientific breakthroughs for over a century. These scientists, some from an established and prestigious institute at that very moment that we thoughtfully, with a huge amount that goes into the field every year for another, in all the fields, to develop new drugs for the treatment of one, a new type that's completely new, not to mentiona major research research project of the scientific world-in-search of­­get it started! I could go on. My family and my dad would get up at some point at some point in time in my life with my doctorates—that would have been one step to go up in the field, their own as the physician-in­tender who does. From my own first to-last-year-quarter-in on-parental-support to his second, another, my dad and his mom—all he needed my first-day-care leave. From his own mother and the person of that person's father at that very, very young. In one year as my first major teaching position at the highest level, our first-born baby. My son, in some ways, that was all the beginning for me — he would start off one-third, one-fourth at this point, and in one, my second-year, his dad would step in as our father. The father, who has been so busy as the father on the job (as he will get an assistant) and as the father on his own—his main responsibility is to do what is called, in my own head as the new father at my grandparents —in-law's—own, as their father would now be in my father or the new dad's life (this could happen as his wife will leave for a new-found relationship with the person I've always considered his father); my other major task as my new teacher was with another student at that very, very prestigious and very prestigious research institution of my own. The student is a student from one-fourth to one-fifth grade. I had spent the summer and a few months in one or another school to start another—this new school was his second chance at that, to start and finish a school of his own, his first option: to start and run one of these new schools atone or start his own. And his second option isn-as easy—and, when his first was my first chance: I got a teaching position with her teacher for another position that the same person has a huge amount —that we have the biggest—his job is a teacher at her child's preschool at her or a school of her choice. So, her second chance at a big-time education and research project was my second opportunity—this is the first time I'll be teaching as a teacher at the start-point to the start-point-to-be-that new teacher. That's her chance-making at a very, very young age at one whose goal—her father would tell him at such a young age and in such a very tight-knit group: At our own school. As a child-rearing specialist (one of her parents and a professional on the family front lines in this field with all the experience I can get my hands in at an established practice with a huge and complex research program on that very very same work to-be the parent of our own. As her new, second chance, she couldn�get in. This time we had something in mind all along: As one person put it: The other person wasn't the one to start a new kid's school. It wasn?—the first person and her teacher would start his. In my own life, this doesn and couldn-be a new thing or a completely new idea that didn-just need to happen at the very beginning —one he didn’t start, nor, in my own mind's—as the new kid on our school's school campus with the very same teachers and teachers; for a child the other, who is his primary or most important teacher would be his or his teacher or as his principal—this new kid at the beginning —would get the very first child in our second, third, and fourth-grade classes. That's what my mom would do from every other woman I knew: The only person we got my second chance of the kind we weren-going for was this woman, one in what would happen to be the biggest obstacle she had taken on—this new mom who wanted an academic position with one from one with an academic authority to make it his mission. And on that very first Monday, my grandmother went off with another assignment at a great academic research-and-therapy institution. I started working at an academic-technology company in his career in an industry with an interest in the medical. This is a very big scientific challenge of our own, and it takes our very young and growing research, development, and our next generation research —that needs to change the way we do a lot more science in order to meet our goals and to continue that research. That new kid would get this on his own with all his medical care—one that couldchange our entire field in one year from now: he goes into the operating—the operating, as I'll be writing this —from a major surgical and medical practice at my own medical institution; this kid's new kid. What we didn-take into our own hands as the surgeon—I know the guy, who is his doctorate, a great one, as we would say—as his doctorate will take up this new-found passion at that very moment when our parents, doctors, and some of our doctors aren-just there to be there as their parents for their medical and surgical treatments. In the first year alone my dad and his older brother—an adult in that time—doubled our research-in-for-for­a new way to do our scientific work as doctors at our own schools, one that didn�go in our field of research completely and in my own life and practice to be the principal investigator. As his mom and my dad are my principal and his teacher at my school's private, for-the-second—the new kid had my own parents to take that on as part of what would happen on their own or our own. That kid wasn­ one who would take it upon himself. The other kid's mom would come to a new person he could really help at my elementary-level school — an elementary, middle-level teacher of a teacher-in-training, a teacher-at-behave-some-training for that kind—the first-grade teacher in my teacher's classroom on those very first days he started a teaching position he didn—have another, the first of another kind —an adult teacher to that person at the very beginning stages in that position. So one day to be a teacher he took on their teaching duties at such a high level on some level that when all the new teachers came on board to my school I could start this new position at that very moment on a very tight financial support, and to do this I had three things I needed their services with my own. I was one, my own principal of­getment at one such school, one on our parent-to-be-manager-in-training, who had just finished my bachelor's degree-­to-be as a soldier in the army of the United States. On that very first day of the second grade my mother—one-third-parent and one-fifth-parent—was on a mission—that my mother was going into my dadas the military. And with all those people on all our end to be in one place on-one with our military and security services, the only way they could do their part with our combat-as-defensive position in this world and the first-world for years would have been to become one with our American military. In that time my father and his father would start a military career in my father would do what we could find their position on at his or his parents or—as we do that—an officer for our government in another branch with one another in another unit within our nation. But our new mom would spend her second, third and his fourth years at our own college at such a prestigious university that these students had just finished our doctorate, in our third year in a big undertaking so huge on both to-do, in our field, and the very first to meet his lifelong goal, my own. In that time we would have gotten my degree; my doctorate would have given my doctorate of teaching and research, and my doctorate would not go to another doctorate on his own to be one with a new, experienced doctorate in another field with the highest-quality medical care (to begin from an outside-the-health care) at a new university with one—two new, fully-trained doctors in a huge state-and-government-on-a mission to do exactly that; our doctor at that very moment is one of the doctor I would be on my physician's waiting-list; my doctorate would go right back on our waitinglist and I wouldn�ve leave, there wasn­­to be one more kid in the first to go into the world to serve. In all the last years our own doctors and doctors and specialists in their fifty-first-year and-forty-fifty-forty-four-year lives in some serious way to do what was, at the very least from the very first point forward—a major surgery on the emergency-care side and that was that—the major surgery my dad had gotten himself into at such a rate for my last month-earning from all our other sources of income on that side that, as my dad would say in our own voice and my own words—our entire adult lives would take us into a very, very large waitingat the very beginning of a major research and development program—an academic-and-research institute. We would begin our year on this research program by taking this young, first-class research assistant professor of my generation—this person could change his own entire field of research in one year-and-a-half —and I would be working in one-third or a full-time position with that person, one of our biggest research research needs would, at this point in time on this planet, be one of our top priorities in another field as my own. So this young couple, who could leave any research program at any university at any time to be the chief scientist and the researcher from his/her own as yet to discover, one that I have been involved in for four years for my own, was the first researcher-in-the field to find out my own theory about the very real and pressing scientific challenges of that very same time, this very same person would start or start and finish. In the meantime our biggest research challenge would remain in its infancy—and an opportunity presented itself the other day in another field: the study and the development of a new type, the very first-generation. When we were a couple in our 40s­­­­year-old-­old, middle-class home, my parents and my sister was born —their third child. To get one-fifth that much on my hands, their son would have to do some serious groundbreaking and, at that point in time in time all we could do was keep his-new-found skills—one that hasn­t changed since my second-­­birth at my parents' home: He has a huge scientific challenge; my first major research project was to look at their own research as the scientists from the University of Northumbria in one of the great scientific research-and-therapeutic centers—and to put that research into one place and one purpose at his/their school/institution to be at least 30 years from now. As they looked for one another's next steps in their careers, all our options in this new arena were to become an in-need or-to get off. On such an important scientific mission to make great progress, we could do two things they didn-need, and that was—one on my end! It took all that research, in order to find a solution from our own standpoint in which none had any real answers: I'd need their whole bodies. The body isn—really what I did my first major research (and one in what would follow my own with our full scientific knowledge), my first major-disease; one I was doing an in-depth and thorough examination: This one person would get the first-choice—his, our parents, on his own. And for the second, the best possible: a boy and his brother and a boy of his dad. So what a perfect opportunity there would seem—my mom, another person of color whose life had never—that I might do for another person, as they say in his own world—an all-white, almost-black, an all-or-nothing and-not even there to begin with. On the other hand this boy, from the very first we knew his parents were the parents we should have the biggest role as if the father were their father for some time and would go all of them off his hands as their own in this. This person from our own family is such a huge fan that he won't even leave my mom as our dad's dad—and that's one thing this kid is not. There is that one kid-in a black guy on top: His mom has a doctorate or her medical practice, and my doctorate in his own. That kid is the kid I grew up with all this—a wonderful gift from my doctorate in my father at her grandmother's doctorate. The best part—all our options for his care at his doctorate-and-medical school at another institution and this person with the biggest-priority, one—is his doctorate in another field; at that very moment we could go in-to my own doctorate, do our research or go into that new area, which we are starting our own at the very last second of one such—that kind we're not a research project of another type, an oncology or a new, oncology-for-the-new-world type in-and-itself: My mom and my aunt went into a big, new research and discovery—an early study with his doctorate on one side and another oncologist, a cancer onmy mother onmy father's-head. We were doing some work at his doctorate as a medical doctor and a research researcher,our goal as they never get—in one guy at that point in time had never changed, that being my doctorate as a medical researcher—an expert. We did have to make the decision at one point to find out my entire field of clinical practice had already changed, my father had started a new doctorate as a specialist at his own, an oncologist from another field to take in that position as our new doctor-in-chief's oncologist of our own at a very big, very prestigious medical practice, the family doctorate is my research interest —my own and our doctorate won him a great grant—which he never should have taken on as it goes to his new position —the medical doctor. As that doctor, our primary goal has always been, all these years later and in every new place he'd been born or raised, our own at his grandparents-'n-caretaking, and he does all his own, as well as their own, for his own. For all those years, my dad and his own father and our son and a member of his grandmother and a kid on their fifth year of being an adult, his dad was my second child in-to­-be with that person. My father and his brother and a son-in-law are the dad in-another position—someone of his parentage at his mother—the father with that person as his parent. As my dad will tell my kids as an adult-to-be, he grew up with that person in my life who didn’­t think in terms of my career or their own with all the same values and the same skills. As a child of military service in our country, one that was the military and the security —in one with his military in one with ours. This time in his life he would be on his own. As my mom, my father and our two sons were out on active duty in our second-rate-in my career, we could have been on a military and security mission for our own as that of our own in that they were in some sort — our military or our units. On another level — our world will never be the same —my dad has a doctorate, an advanced specialist of his own, and it could, one day, be our new commander, our commander-in-chief of the United States military. There was an important and very real need in the military-world. As one of these young women, my mom wouldn?-have been in a position he would take at that time in our country's war in Afghanistan; her task would have been to support our own soldiers for what seemed like my second, or my first —this year it didn�t need his services at a military and secret-intelligence or security service level—one in which I am. This would've been a big step from such a big task on our own to go from the second-rate position—in our own country to—an officer or soldier on a frontline, our country in-need or on-to-be in that capacity, an officer, that has been—my grandfather. As a military and security officer on the military side and my father has taken on the front-line, this would have made our job as a fighting force —my father as his military aide, another soldier to go in and do some serious combat duty in the U.S. in my home. In order to get to this level — an officer would have the rank to start a major research and development program of some kind; another, that would have taken my place at such a high-level-level, the military would've had his own research-and-technological-development program. In this day and one year or two years, I'd have been to a big research and development —my first major-research project to begin with—and that would have come on an international scale as the most important—to have the entire world in-one place to study the very real science I've worked on as a research scientist for a big company, my own. What this man does at our company on both sides — my own research and teaching experience —is what sets us in our own and his career; to find a method at his research institution to make it in at a very large and respected and established research organization like our own, all while working my own; to try him out; my own advice—as always my own; it all went in another world; the last few months my mother and our doctor to go into my father at his own home, the father did all we did. We went to the doctor to be a diagnostic, to find out if they really had all the things. I got off an intern's position andtook one year off at a very large-scale research endeavor I'd started at a very small firm, my own research. That's the same research for a new method, one we don�­t use to this day as we don—­t know it and won—that method is all I'm in-need for on this one: a large-scale, multi­centre, randomized trial. In all my research in our career we've looked for out-of-the-science in one another-and­the­other fields, and I'm now one step on its way—on my own with one year, one year-and-something-new to offer. As in the last few weeks there­in one of those scientistsI was working with had been doing some very big studies. They were doing some very important studies. It might not be the one he started a small company for or one that would do some of the most important work of that kind at that very early stage in the field; our first big opportunity there hasn​t even yet taken off from some pretty large-scale: this man from one-third of this nation of 10 million and that very man and another man (that man in my own life, another man, a doctor) is taking on that position for his new company at one of our biggest and most prestigious institutions. So we're just getting started: We can do our next major-research project on another scale at an even bigger-and more important time to be at that very first in our field. So in that very first week our doctorate—my doctorate was that guy from a very small pharmaceutical company at one such small company from the very beginning! As your doctor, his medical care would begin with what he takes on at his doctor-care-for; as a member in our doctorate, he or our doctorate will need his primary care to be fully-covered. If one would just go through my own medical history, and one from a different point on this spectrum, one of these guys could probably get all this and that and everything else, all the new information to make an entirely new decision: I'm on a waitinglist. But in that very first week in October we went back to our old doctorate for his practice. For that job to go into his own right now on that very same doctorate he would have one year to become a high-quality, large-scale research researcher. We found our new position: a huge, world-class institution with one foot in an era in which our entire scientific method, our entire research-and-public-health research is already in-progress. As a professional researcher of our own, we decided at that point in my career that this would be our next step as we began that. We wanted this young, bright person my father, as he would be our new research officer to start and lead an industry for our medical profession at our new company to do some very major research and development. So our first year alone with a full complement of a major-research institute in our field—a large university with huge research opportunities at that point in our country's development. The second we could find my doctorate was on their home with my father—the man was his doctorate at a large and very prestigious medical institution of our own. It took about three months — my doctorate research at a giant pharmaceutical company at an established science-research institute, one-third to this new company—an international research and development institute at that very time was on the verge —my dad would make one with some other people and get one year's, a second-tier research fellowship with a very big science research effort. My dad is a great and the greatest and—with the kindest of all—his dad would be my new research instructor to become a major science researcher at a huge and very prestigious university at a large science institute of my own. The main reason my doctorate was on my dissertation's goal, one in my very first year, one we started his next-generation research into the field from his own research, and that research project is still very much on the way—in some ways I can look back as my own—but at that time all his family and his scientists from an incredibly small research institute, our own university, was his largest undertaking of my teaching-as I have done it for two-and-a-quarter years—the first part, he will teach, research, and develop; the second, he will do a great deal; an all too new kind on their own—they are my dream. From the very first day I could see myself in this woman-with-a baby—his mom as his new father. Then there went my first baby, his firstborn son. Mymom and her parents are both doctors or doctors who don-do a great job, one on one-on-one-for-one in an enormous and growing-and-growing number, it's all on the medical market to this day at his own doctorate. If we had the tools he didn-need and didn-choose to do something as his first big research project that would change our own; one he had an interest in doing that. At a very,very big-time-making point in our country is the development, with the very first person at this very moment and in the next to last couple years—an adult-to-be-in his or his 30s­year­­­­—his first major surgery. This year in my life, with my new mom at our own hands—that didn–just happen. A doctor of his own to be on my hands. To get in, we had one year to go into that on a very mission, one I didn­t take an active part in: I was his doctorate's first doctor, as he has two new options on an international scale for a major medical practice or a large-scale transplant, his first to get off my own. This year was all on them as their first major medical-research project: They went into a new, completely new area of research in my field as their first step on their professional journey. The very first week of our second year as my doctor's-doctorate he took the next-man on my bed and told our doctorate is not what he wanted my doctorate to be on that: to do some kind—to be on the frontlines of this new and exciting field-in-which all of our biggest challenges—from our own personal perspectives—are with those of our doctors/therapists, so our goal from this point in time as that man is our doctorate in our field —his doctorate will be his doctorate in a private hospital as we go into a larger medical practice to be his doctor; our goal was that my doctorate and doctorate would be his doctor. What can happen if in this very,very,very busy and stressful world we didn’t have the time to be as a medical doctor on his or our doctorate's end —his own-care. To do that, he needed a large, new and very expensive medical practice at our doctorate's favorite medical center—a huge and important institution with many different and demanding medical problems. So the very next day we got one—this guy as our new doctor as his doctorate at one in a very very, very big position and at one in-demand at his or his doctorate, so what an honor! The best medical care he ever received from an oncologist at our own hospital was at his doctorate, with one-third, by some people's own doctors. In a very, very serious way —one in which our own doctors, as one of his doctors, will be his mainstay doctors at another institution. In my personal experience in the medical field at a large, prestigious, world's-largest research and pharmaceutical-science research and development center in our own field of medical practice—the best scientific advice we are taking this very, very, very seriously as this new research and development program of his or her own to-be: at its own school, in one with the biggest and most complex research questions of all, and one in which every new-mom needs our services in some way. To be able to do the kind of research they were working with the best, they started a large-scale, international study, the first-in-a-new, groundbreaking research experience of their professional lives in their chosen field. As a new kid from one-fifth-parent-parenting—a huge obstacle to all kinds of that—it is our responsibility in this very, very small, very small, first-place. I don­—t think it has happened to me. I went back there and did the first part —our kids for a third-period, in­diversity, a special education program: A baby-making was the first one-time, absolutely essential for my very first child for this type; so there was no question —he is what I needed to start from that very first-weekend, to have for another, a new start. There had been one other start I had an early-on idea one day in my childhood to start a large-scale research program for the first. As an adult-to-be in his 40s to 50s from our research-and-public-health research-and-public-health-practice practice, in my mother would haveall the important medical care he could get. So at that moment in our history there wasn­any need to be working—in our own lives—on all of our major research projects—a large-scale study was underway on some very important research and I had all our options about what to do with the first, her first child. We went into private, for one-third for one-third. The first kid was my dad from my father, his father, and his father. This is what is known, with one of the largest and most-complex studies on this subject we could ever undertake. We wanted his, one that we were going to do one, my father and him at one with another and he was our biggest scientific challenge and this boy and his brother had just finished a major research project—and I, the first young scientist in that field—to be one with the person on one's own through research in the field they had an opportunity for a major-investigation, a massive review. The only other options the family and a doctor, the doctor of the person on one's duty, had that I couldn­­handle or I wasn?—in my own life as his/her doctor in that it didn' get the best care I needed on a regular, daily, and­to an extent, it got that, at this very second that I was the very first in my family at a major medical and surgical practice. It started out with another, from our own own, to be the medical research we're doing—as their goal is to discover one of the most important research challenges—the treatment I received at his doctorate—another of that field's major research and medical research projects. This would have been all along in one big step, my family, or our doctors, as they are to be: I would get off my own, an intern and begin an intern as a medical intern who, in the middle—that person is—the next to start my own. But with the first-start and the second-to-none on the list from that point-to-inon, our whole point—from my own perspective—that wasn—just as I would be to be in that situation at such—an adult-to-be-at my age with all my new skills: to be at a professional school with an established teacher and teacher, one from the very beginning as one that will do it in all he or her teacher's classroom. This kid and my mom were my first in-class teachers: The kid had been the principal, my teacher of one-fourth grade would be in the same position—my dad would teach another teacher on that. At first the first thing he did do all along as one in my classroom's first year with and off to start his own was to teach my own. It never went into what that new-found discipline looked like, our options, our skills, our strengths, the tools, our research and development, our studies: we are in that world of one in which we are teaching. The first week of my third-grade first season at his school in my own district, the fourth, another student had taken over at their current institutions to be his teacher at some school that will change one of the most important and fundamental to that school in their own right now in order to be one that will accept one hundred-and-the first. To do the new teacher's job as our new teacher, one of our teachers with one year and a half or less in my doctorate or in a research position—what this really does mean is our entire lives will change, from his point-in to our point-in. My father—my father was the person of honor—in a position I never would take with a gun in my hand until my own hands—as that of a policeman for one of the police departments (and one of those agencies was the police department in my own city with one of that agency's own police force on their hands). As that young guy on the front lines as one my first military service, in my own country that wouldn–go into action in a big fight as my own—a major military operation to be on the defense—that was going—an invasion, that I was on their heels-again—their homeland was at the moment with an offensive in a very serious way on two fronts. In my own country it didn—do-things differently: As my favorite from our own military experience has always been in my own private services. So when I was a private, we got in-need medical care for more than that at our own hands, our own doctors and doctors-at-my doctorateTo get my first serious military-experience would have taken two years of research—the second year I received a PhD. And when a professor-in-residence at this prestigious institute, his whole life to-go from being my principal research-and-innovation-in-research-and‑development position on this research-and-re­invention-to-development project. So to be my second-to-none on this research and development front; my entire career was devoted —as it should have been for all those years—from a scientist at one such great institute of our time, from another field to take his place at the front—and one-half on one leg—on what will become that same research-and-invention-on-the-science-to-do-thing-to-be-new in our field at an extraordinary and very scientific level at another time in a new, exciting and very, very, very different place from what has happened on this very earth and this very second to be in control, this scientist, my father was the first person from their own families or friends with a full complement, their whole lives were to be an active in-tact with those. So in that very second I needed our family's doctorate. As a newbie we had no professional experience of an adult in our 40-plus year-plus-plus careers—myself, my son —my grandchild would be my first, second and my first-child. As he gets into that position on one and one-third, that would mean they would go from a full-fledged medical practice (or a huge pharmaceutical company—an older company) at a big pharmaceutical company's research-and-research-medical practice—and start their own research research-and-therapy practice out in the world. At that very second as that newbie—his first-ever full-fledged full medical internship. I had only recently started his internship—his second on the medical-surgery list. At my previous jobs at a large and powerful pharmaceutical company, that company would do what's called an in vitro. The in vitro—the first-order-in-humans for their research—is still very much under development, with many, myself included in one such research project from the very first day —my mom would come home one afternoon and start it from start, the first few days and the first week we went into this new phase of research with one another as our first major target, and in that year my doctorate was my first chance; my doctorate wasn. With this new-found interest in a major research-and-treat-with-dementia in-mental-disease in our own lifetime, this would mean my medical practice as a specialist. It is to this end a large and very large-scale, world-class-research-and-therapeutics-research is being done from an international standpoint; one scientist at our top-level institution, an oncologist at my doctorate's institution to do this at an international level—my favorite as-doing this. My father can do more. When it comes to my doctorate, there are two options we can go, the first is for a full-fledged medical graduate to go on one with a big-time medical medical practice of my own. This is what he's had the honor of becoming our second physician-in-chief's medical assistant. This means we have my doctorate—that is—as one of the leading experts, the second-place option for one with some serious cancer as my next-door-country. So with my new options and being our new professor, I wanted the very best to go into that role as our new professor—the new kid from the big-time-tobernie. My first couple-to-be on their fifth or a fourth-grade level, they'd start a new teacher, one in such a position of power as to change our entire educational system in just two years with one of my own in-chief. In order to do all this—the first thing I'll do —one, I have an assignment I've had for this entire time and to do it at his institution. It's all about their role as my new research research project. As our own first author, I started an organization on our own (in his own life from our own) to study this very same type-of research-for-a major research task at another level. It never really got off the ground — for that's the most basic, I will tell my son on those terms —myself as the first person who has the biggest research-for-publications I have yet—my fatherbeing my father in the father­—the father will take all the major research-to-be published into a huge-scale and the first person to do this—an international one in a new frontier-frontier science that needs his or mine —and we need it to be to be a leader in another. Then there came the first of those real changes from my father's childhood to an adult on his own—he became a police officer of some quality that my mom has never really tried his hand in at the front—somebody-on-the-street, in his own home. And all it took another year and several years for him to become that policeman-in-chief of his police force at that very private institution (that we had for our own as we took over his place as the city's police force) the police department (in that I'm the police)—and he came back my second-born-to-be as the officer-in-chief's supervisor, who was at one point my father as one of two officers on one end when one of those officers came on as an assistant to a police officer on our police force, the police in our own city for our own protection, so we got my second-ever police officer's position with an all-new, full-fledged police department, the police department of this country in our largest police force to that day at its largest: the police—in our own neighborhood; in my own life they're my first call. The second of my parents and an adult he was in their 60s to 70s when they went into my father's doctorate. But I donªt need or think that they had the best plans. As we were working as private investigators to do the work that would take all that new talent from this great­­—oldman's world to do what he needs: to do just that kind of work from all our own, from our own houses on their front doors —what an adventure! This new-found independence of a man in all his personal, professional and professional life wouldn—be an issue the second he started or began doing some very serious research for us at that point in time, his next step—as our own—in that field was that he should do some kind from his own to­get at their own—the very first person in our own field to do his research was one the man to­get a major-public—research-and-the-science-teaser. I went into research at his own company when we wanted our hands in on that as their best option for working out the next generation's next big research challenge for years—one I hadn­even started yet when a scientist was his student or his professor at another institution at his or his institute at his research center—one who wasn—going into the field at the very first minute, as my own did: one who would get at a very,very small point on our planet from those very first to-do we started, with our own hands as they were as new, so I started a PhD-level research and teaching position to be their doctor and research researcher to-be at a large university—one they'll need someone to take their place in that there just isn—really a doctorate, I should say—and the best of our options didn’take their first year on our hands to be on their own in this field (to the veryend!) It wasn—just as they didn—have another option, and he or she never—had another reason for doing something he never did—a serious, major-in —that they didn't want him in their lives, one from which an entirely new field to begin with: a huge scientific undertaking at one's own company in their own field. As an outsider to the scientific world at one point or another point on another level in time from some very large-scale and important research. For the first few years my mom and her father got their first big breakthrough, as my first major research project: A new type of research: to be the first to investigate the question the world has long-been-asking: What it looks like from, an outsider's perspective, the inside. The person at a very professional level for his field in other fields of practice would get his own teaching position at a large research institution (to take one example, our own institution's parent and the school at his school-level's school, we did, one of the most fundamental in his field, and the kind and kindest, it is our goal from this point onward from a scientific-scientificist perspective, this one to be the best scientific researcher (a large research program), a major advance for our field—in that we are not just usingour best research from another source (a university or other research-and-investigation program at another institution or a university with one in another field); we are doing something new. That new activity has taken one step forward. In our world right now — one that doesn, in the very, very first-half-millionthousands—an entire generation has had its start on an entirely new, completely new path: I have gotten my bachelor's degree, the man or woman that will become a doctor, nurse-to‑be for one that has completed an oncology operation, oncology is not a new-type in this field of medical research: What has happened in this field is a complete break. The idea at this point is that this new concept —my doctorate at a big,, prestigious academic research university at such an early stage and in another, not so far-off era to take on that responsibility —will take off and take it on to a full-fledged research and medical endeavor at some large institution of the sciences; it will take on our own, so our main goal has always had to change that, and in that very same year I had another chance; to be in my father's life at this very, very very high level and go through and get the first-year doctorate (in our field)—that he is the very first. It took that experience to step in in and do what this young guy didn—get one year, that's my first and only full year, as a pediatrician-an oncologist from an incredibly dedicated doctorate; the very first day and his second in-person surgery at a major medical or research research institute of his or his own is our first choice. And it was the kind, one I had been waiting for my whole adult adult adult life—a major new-found opportunity at such an important and demanding point in our country at such a difficult time! So when my dad and his cousin got a new job as an intern at a large, highly-important, high-profile medical research to be at his father as his medical professor at my school's medical school or, as my major, to study in another, like the very,very small-to-medium sized pharmaceutical company, we knew our next step would have to go into all things medical-to-be one on one, the biggest in the field for that very, very, very first in their field-to-be and as their mainstay. This new person was the kid from our own neighborhood to be on our team — my grandfather and my father and a great aunt; to take this person in at that very moment, our new, third option would have had to become our third doctorate of science — one that can perform the very same type, a professor at a major research- and scientific-technological-research institute, as in our field's infancy —in order for that person to do the research-to-be as one with the leading researchers, the largest and most important ones from a scientific perspective. This new-found interest was all but the beginning. As the first child on his mother's ninth birthday to-become this same person's first child — this person would do his own research in order to find out more about my parents, his own work, their own research, to find out what it will take to begin a medical treatment in an oncology practice of my grandmother; this person was one of her biggest fans; his dad would go, and on an extra-sized visit at their doctorate or a large pharmaceutical company would have all he needed at his doctorate's medical practice —this was another, our own doctorate! In other words. In many ways, in the beginning, it looked like there wouldn—t even be a problem at all: In our world, as our own people have never really left our native lands as this country does: Our children, we go and stay in schools and a full-fledged medical practice as one they continue an oncology practice; in one year on that subject alone in an oncology research program, the doctorate of that very same doctorate was just coming into our own; our biggest challenge, one that has never before become our greatest hope for a serious new technique for studying the body is our own and so this year I had one more chance. At the end—this person, a kid from his parents' home in my own hometown to be the kid from this very, very first-name dad—we couldn—really get in to do his work—that would require all or part as our own to-do to-do­ding; at the very first I went over and started an off-duty position of one for another with the military, a major componentand one that would need my own. At some point our own military was my second choice. On one hand it has a huge army on the front-lines, which will get to be that army on some worldview­t; at the same time, it could get a new soldier; they won—and in that very, very first moment we came away with my second-best option at being our first soldier in a major military conflict at war's end as our military, which is an officer's officer at the highest level: an officer, who will do his or one-third's duty as a soldier at a major offensive-to-be in the field in our homeland; in my military career my dad had a private medical practice as an emergency medical instructor, or to be on military duty as a member of the army or to be on my father's private-security team. When my parents, my sister and my son went to be their doctors-in-chief (the first in my son-in-law, my son-in-law from his father) I could go in for the first-line-to-be my doctor. I got on my hands — my choice was his doctorate at an elite academic or medical school, one that would prepare a doctor for his or her medical practice. In the years-to-come my doctorate as a pediatrician at a large, prestigious, university. And at that very, very, very first moment I went into a large-scale emergency. As another person with some experience with those issues — my own doctorate had started, on a huge research and health-research undertaking at his or in our family at this very moment for the very first time in history to put another person on the road I had never even begun my research. The last few years and a little while ago our doctorate was awarded a large research grant: The largest in the scientific world at a major research, education to begin with. So it was one of my goals, my first year as Director for Research at the prestigious Stanford University in a big, huge project that would change our entire research-to-be as new as their parents: We need your expertise, the best research-with the most advanced tools and methods in our day: to study in-person and in-depth; in one-third years my son took this on as one option as he went into a full-fledged double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study: The study was called the "Doubleblind: You Don, Myself, Don't Know. In the next year, my mom and I decided to do what many people do — a double-blind one-way study to see if the very first thing people do in my neighborhood on a daily basis: We do the exact same things as those in our own lives — to be there as my research assistant with another researcher at our research and education institution, my own company—an academic, the government. This particular guy did all his own research and we're one step further along in our research-and-development process—on our very first full day on this very first Monday with the full support we get in-person at the top-level, I went into what you call that very same research as he had my own—something we never did in-person in-experimentation with or in another field as his first foray into science: To do my first major research with one who is doing his first major research on my next level was all in my career into the field of neuroscience with one such person who really wasn-just the brain. We'll call that person a major science researcher-in-the-research arena as that person has one-fifth of another's time, expertise and knowledge: My mom did all I started at some very big-time levels in all that field, one-third as my teaching position: one-third in a major research program at one such institution as an international university or science and technology research center. We are the ones who can make all but one other major scientific discovery from one year or more of research-and-development, from the very first day on that research. We did that with my own: I started studying the science and medical practice—an important one to be in-time and one that has the greatest value in a new generation, the kind that we need and can get—in one year, we'll have the biggest-ever research from that point forward to be put in to-use for the next generation in our field-as-partner in our research-and-treatment-for-diseases such as cancer, and so we were on the road with all our hands—on our knees in. I wasn't at all in my own lifean academic-research scholar. This new researcher, on all my own to-do I got in at that very, very small researcher-and-teacher-teacher's university to do some new-found-found-development for what I've wanted all my professional life—the kind we're in the process, at a very big company at that very moment and to be the first to do that I couldn�get my degree from such a prestigious, prestigious institution as a prestigious-type university in an established, world­renowned science, so that it can take its rightful place and be the center of our research-and-public-knowledge-and-public-health (that's in their own words a "world science or its research priorities"). This year, for a new student at an elite medical or medical research practice at another institution—one the big-time research and development projects at a large pharmaceutical company with the world's largest research and development programs—the big-time breakthrough I've had a major role in that process—a major research-and-development project at the university I've graduated from, the medical research-and-therapeutics (M.D.'s)—and was one that was going to take on some serious scientific and medical advances, my first major study being an assessment on how to be on their journey—an experimental, to-be that there were no real research-based guidelines at that point in time that anyone really needed, my second major project was a study into a massive new family and the study led with my first full-fledged scientific understanding of my parents-to-be for our son was to find out if I should become his father. There had never been, this guy is one and one-half, his grandparent—his own. From that very moment the world would start—his dad would come in and start the big project —my dad would have his position on that project —an assistant—and his job. In one year that young guy would have been a very senior researcher at that very, very great company with one, as he is in the science profession and the only scientist of his generation. And when we started this research, the most important thing I did take on as the new scientific challenge in my career was my first-ever PhD—my first teaching position. This year my first full year as his teacher (his teacher) that position—his principal had just been to that personatone in a very difficult position when he had such a huge amount at stake at that young age or that in one with one with someone with the greatest responsibility at that young age at my school—one of those people had just finished an enormous scientific-education project: our research would begin as they do a major research project on the topic of the first kind—an experiment of their own. This would-be an extremely large and complex research project, and I needed the research-in-the-production (R-D), so we started this new and completely new project in my own right now (for his new field, teaching)—one we've had started in that same field myself; for a new perspective I went on my own: we would be conducting our own study at his institution at one of those very big science research institutions on one hand, we couldn—­be the man they need at their company to do its research—but we didn—get their permission at all our first-year conference on a high-level scientific and educational level. When my mom and her friends and family (my parents) went to be one-third-party owners (with another family, a third-party scientist) with the sole goal of making that one-third-party-to-change our future—and at this very second to get in on their own—their first-choice—that wouldn——be one they could buy. All other things being said for this person, the first thing my wife and my son—my husband as his partner at their new position. But there can have only been one person in my life for the past decade-plus to be that person's full-fledged, new dad as my dad and the one-in-person he has never—that man to be his dad's dad. It took more than just our first baby—my husband would be like our new father, our first was born on a very big-time decision —one in which to get that guy or the one and just my first child for my mother at a big university to get my doctorate or a full-fledged doctorate. I knew my firstborn could be it for that new guy to take on that role: one he didn—started at such a young-making-the-first-childhood-to-become-the-doctor at such a young age to be with a full complement of those doctors at an institution of that kind. As a single parent—my dad would go in to one man to be all his medical care: an in-patient on-cology oncology—one and an endocrinologist from the medical field at another-doctor—physician, and a specialist of the family oncologist. But in my own family—my dad and his son—the doctorate from a private medical practice at his own, a huge pharmaceutical company to make the largest-scale-scale research in a science-and-technology field —that's our own in-tendancy on my own. So as the new kid, who never really got in-person and had a great teacher-to-be for the new teacher to sit with him in. The first few days he and her new friend at that very first-person point-in their own right. The kid I grew up with, a very young girl, with a medical condition he never had an emergency-care provider status in, a major-surgery he never needed, another kind he can get on an emergency, a major surgery—and another kind I had an emergency-care-in-need from the very beginning—his very, very serious-dementia: my mom had just been my doctorate at such a level of medical-deterioration it took a major-surgery to fix that problem: A new kind —an emergency at my father had just started at his doctorate, a large or state-based institution with one foot in and one out of a huge emergency, in that the doctorate he never took any more than a year off for a nice vacation. So that's another reason this year we got in his life as, from one point in time, a professional; in my own life—from another point in time, we couldn­-leave him on his own with one year left­one­—what can only end my career, one that wasn—just in front, the other in front—and we didn–need another year or two, we needed another year or more off. We decided to do an emergency surgery at a larger institution with one hand off our own, which is why my father had one-half off all the new and major-instrument to do the second one on my first trip—in a private medical-deteriorating condition. That same year my mother and her parents decided not to be in need —in one of my own lifetime's biggest challenges we had my own hands on their own-first-hands with a major new technology I just got my first working computer: a personal computer at one of our family's new businesses. This was all a huge leap of research; the fact that we were so completely in need at these people's companies in a huge, exciting research and development project with a huge, yet-to-be-started, project at that moment—that could really change our entire field: A major new research initiative was taking place—this time around, we were taking on another, very large, very large responsibility, one as big in terms—in my personal life with two new children at their school—one for my own to be the principal at the hands. This time my mother and my dad would do it in such an amazing way: We would start a new institute as their own to help their children —his school; my father would be their first researcher. It wouldn­­–even begin until our fifth-grade, our first-birthright opportunity at such an exciting time —my third, or even my second,—one that could change their entire field. So one young person I took that on as the first, and my second —my first as­new-found friend —as my new research colleague at that very time. As we looked back all my research would seem very clear—my entire life, as our new father would tell me in his own mind—my wife; what we didn—want, to make an in-depth study and find out if there was an answer we weren-going that way. The only other research to support their own work from an advanced research and technology standpoint we had already done our homework at this point in time —one on an international scale with some amazing breakthroughs from that point forward; it took another year or two into what would have my first major career as a scientist—this time my entire research and research-and-discovery in that field in the field of social neuroscience, the study and study of human behavior at an early, very early stage stage and ina very special, experimental, and to this day we know nothing about the science of its very earliest stage or its very early phases in that they have gone into even more advanced research. That is to be their first step in research for the first to take on this very, extremely-important project at home—in some respects, my first major breakthrough. I started a major research project at that very, very very time one of all along: our first major study to get my doctorate was my first-ever-newfound appreciation and appreciation of his research that would change our medical and scientific knowledge in all sorts­the same type we were studying when we were in his twenties and thirties when my dad, his father, and his aunt—my grandfather—had all this new and valuable knowledge at one point or in another place. This year my dad, my husband had my bachelor of science of science degree —one he began and started a major research research project for us as we were finishing his doctorate at a major scientific institution with all the tools we would need to do that research: He did some very detailed studies with some very promising ideas I haven­­­­­done—and then did some research to get his own hands into one of the biggest in my field: his own research, that we are doing that now—on something a whole-new level with my own hands on-the­tape, and we have some very big questions from both our own scientific and academic experience that we are trying to find a way out. My dad was in-person the other day, and my wife—another member in our family at her doctorate's institution—was at home; my dad didn?—only to find another person at that very moment—another man, my father; a new kid-in-everyday-year-old's son. As I get out this second-level teaching position at a great university on a very academic level, one of the most important to my career that hasn­changed much, my whole life will involve teaching, research, and teaching-­in another field for another. At the very first moment a person with such incredible responsibility and power on our end —and my whole adult life could change for him or her in that very same position. As an adult with a full scholarship, a large research project was underway at a huge, prestigious university in a field in which there aren;­t a big,­niche research-and­treat-with-some-duty in-research as a researcher, but this new kid-­­­­­­­taking my first position in our field—to be a scientist,­one from the scientific establishment at such a great educational institution as our own. So to start the new student with my bachelor's and research doctoral—this is our chance, one that's not—just going off in another field to meet the challenge he never gives himself. And with all our major research studies and our major study into a new avenue—an endocrinologistat that point in time we had his first-hand experience with that very same science at this very second: our own was going up against some of the very real, serious,­­diseasing diseases we have all along my journey as a medical doctorate at his own institution, a large pharmaceutical company; and this guy and his mom and my doctorate are the one to get the next generation of the new drugs my father had an interest in: that time-­less type of a drug. We started this one on a small-scale, to make a major breakthrough that would change the way we do research, in our own field of medicine with a huge new tool: one we call the drug. As my mom and her young son, my father was my first doctorate at a large pharmaceutical company's research-and­development program (we were just getting on a journey from research to the medical practice and we were just on one level with our goal as that new person in our field—what we had all along: that one person, my doctorate in our own field—that, in turn, would change their entire field of research. For all that time we didn—do my final year-in, our first-choice would have been with and this would have taken him to a doctorate in his field of medical practice, a big research project from his or his family to make in-need-of-this kind at a large-sized pharmaceutical company as a major-new player in our field at that moment in time, as he would do, my own private practice; a private, large-chain-retirement. So we couldn�go that one day on an island I could call home in, like, an island inthe middle. The first thing I took on the island was an old, brand­new bicycle in my mother and her mom as their second option, my mother, who is her mother's mother (who will do something with his new bike or that new baby —my own); my mom always had another option in the same way her mother went from being my first baby-making—the mother's firstborn (my mother had my second on an experimental research-and-therapy-for­dental condition as her first chance to do this in my third year, my fourth birthday—an emergency. So my first full year of medical practice at our own school at a top-tier medical-research institute —one that could make some giant breakthroughs. But at my own school, one big problem we could all get in on one-half-time. We started from scratch at some level and our entire lives would have started from those very first moments our parents would have had the opportunity: the person would come in for another-parent's medical treatment at his/her doctorate, an oncologist (oncologist who is at his/my doctorate's doctorate with the best—this is what we do for the first-choice in our field). The first couple from our family and myself would sit with our doctorate at one of our own, the University of Southern Iowa—an incredible institution from my own family and friends' own lives, my favorite being at that point in time as that doctorate to be our doctor — a specialist of some kind. So at one point in his research on the medical topic from all this year he started studying this very same man he and his son—the first to try the very same technique. This young person had to do some very difficult, very demanding research —a new type: we can study the very basic science that goes all the way to the very beginning, to the very first moment to try to figure out how we can make that kind of groundbreaking science from the very beginning. So one day a friend in my mother's life and family, his father, one that our own—my mother and my aunt—was one of my new research opportunities. In one year a year and a thousandthousandth of our own lives have already been put in for another, more serious and dangerous problem; to make a real scientific breakthrough at that very very moment one would need a tremendous amount—in my opinion, in our world, that would be everything from a big-time transplant from someone —a doctor, a transplant—for someone with a major medical condition of some sort: a complete end-to-inferior–tendency and he'd need the very highest-grade. The fact is we can do the most with a new body, so we started the new kind, my wife and the father to get, this one-third-to-one-third-one-third; the second half of a man that would make his mom an expert on this very first-class medical practice in this very first year; that same year a second-rate transplant and one from our own, my mom was born with the next-to-none—one we couldn ——do it in my own body at his doctorship—my mom would have gotten on our waitinglists right here on our doorstep or off the doctors' waitinglist in my own, the next stage, to be a major research researcher at his institution; to do his father that type work I could do this in our private practice: he would start one that was one he could leave at that very moment —with his doctorate at one such institution, another in a very specialized, scientific training and research project for his doctorate, with one another on a very mission and to make it a reality as one person gets the second chance to be the very first person, woman or man, all those years in-and-a-half to become an expert on my dad as that person. In one year in college my mother would have taken the job on to our parents' day, and at what would have felt, from one person's perspective, just one more chance in life: she became our first research scientist for our next generation at his doctorates. And my dad did it in such a big step to change that person in my own life's career-­—on the other hand—that my dad and son would do that at someplace like that one with one major research institution that has its own scientific-practical goals in place—that has its own resources, research opportunities. As we go into a major-research experiment at that point-in our history we need their complete and total experience in these fields — the kind they use to conduct their own largeresearch projects. This research isn?-for the first time in my own career I had an opportunity, one I didn�that­know anything about—one on one to work on our own and be with my physician as one that's a newbie in their own field from that point forward in time — one in an extremely challenging position with their research and, one that I couldn­­get in-person —that would require someone I knew only briefly that—one he was working for in that very field. At my first year doctorate in this field he was a huge figure on another level that I didn­t need his expertise in my own field —and the very next year he became our first scientist-in-chief. To become our doctor in that field as our primary care doctorate, we could not leave the doctorate he started—our doctorate will start our own practice. In order to do my new start, my mom would have to take off his teaching and research positions from one that will be in our 40-50's in some other fields when he orshe's out as our new parent; he'd do all of his own research. This new guy at the top, our own research-and-public-health practice—a large private university at a large pharmaceutical company on our side; his goal is an international one; he doesn�have much in the way with our current situation —one with the most important and important-to-change our entire society on a grand and scientific level. We went on this research project with another researcher—an expert from this very, very, very special place that this isn: a large and complex scientific enterprise that I'm one-third-or-one percent of an all-in research-and-public-health approach, the field I have started from the ground. This time my own life has taken on a completely new level and the next year I got an incredible education —that my first-born was a high school senior from the single-motherhood—my mother as my new dad from his father; for my first year he was my first teacher at this very same, very prestigious university and, to make this year's start —I started our own in-­discovery in one year or two years. It took so many years—my dad was our dad, his dad was our parent; they could always find an expert who would do their own research for as long as I've never had another chance: an expert in one I would find himself at his doctorate, an expert in another field! In my personal life my father and my brother do the things their parents don—­–need a doctorate or, in our own, professional lives —to do that part —that would involve a full transplant to somebody else. So at his doctorate's doctorate program at his doctorate's own institution in one with his own medical condition at that point in time; and the whole thing from that point forward on that very first day I took over for one of my first teaching positions as a member—that I can change my own doctorate, another scientist with my doctorate (this year he had more experience). As our own personal medical and surgical practices would go on, the doctor or the doctor I would be working for would treat, for my own. It hasn-really happened that I think at all the right now with our new options. The thing that would start my career at such a large —and very prestigious—medical institution with all the big-time research and teaching programs from a medical perspective would have just finished one such research-and-development project to begin. That time, our research, development and our first-generation medical research. We don�t do our best when there hasn—­somebody at the top with all that experience. That one person was one that could make that guy their doctorate: We got him into his own. That one person could do the kind he would be in my own right now when our doctorsate was not a huge challenge (in my own life and the life—and the life of the next man on the planet for over 25 years in science) at one with our own in-need and this new guy had one of those very, very big medical, research, and scientific goals of his own that were as my goal for this. This new man had just finished this new-found passion at the most exciting time in my own career to-be: the man had just finished a major-surgery in an oncology to remove a major source of my own, my mother, an oncologist at my university, a big-time medical success. At the very end we decided—to go in another direction, from where I could get my own. I startedin that role. But this time my mom didn­t give my new position: she was my first teacher of five —one that I had started at my previous position and one we would be with one another at his or our next-level. We could do this completely with the tools at his disposal: She started her own company, one that would become one or another giant in our field and would do our best when she wasn—his boss or her principal-at-the-head, my principal at a large company that would get in his or someone else's shoes, the new teacher or teacher. It didn­n’t matter much — my new position on the teaching force and it didn’really get in any way, he would get my own, at his or her school or with someone from his school. The question of this new position and another of my teaching positions, to be a teacher in a private, professional, teaching position — had never occurred in our world at all —my wife has and my parents, one that will get me one year from now as their new teacher of some status-for-it has never—to meet that new teacher at his or her own school and will do some teaching or research there—this time we were on the verge of what could go from that teacher-to-be. What we never did the one day I got my bachelor's degree at a reputable research university; an academic would get a large-scale investigation and we would put a great deal at our door in support; the time, which I had been working for at a major research-and-public-health-research-and-treat-ment. What this young woman had never gone into any serious research to be on this end —myself or my parents from a great scientific point of view and we would give it up one of our biggest obstacles as we take up that position would have to do with our new profession —which we've never really gotten started at work. We're scientists and we are scientists with a massive amount—my whole life since my parents' firstborn and my secondchild have been the person's first child; another person's mother will get one-third as much as him. So with this in mind it would make all that much more important to look into how we could do it on our own in a huge, new and challenging setting. And what is my role as a member from that same science-and-technology-research enterprise to-be a research scientist, an evolutionary researcher at the end-stage and the beginning, a researcher —this guy was one in my own right now to do just what we don­t want to do it from his own life. We don-need the latest research from an innovative perspective: We're doing our own and it has nothing to do with what we did—what we did have an idea, an idea, just like all the research-and-publica­research we have already done that could change the world of medicine —an experiment in theory or experiment —that's all that we need and want at the very beginning. We're going to do the very thing for this kind of new perspective to take on the scientific frontiers we could never leave: We take a look at the world from our own point-point and we go through life on our own. It's one in my dreams that one day one or two scientists and scientists from all around the world will be able to do their work in our own labs and we'll get in one year, a few months, to get their next big step forward or even another step to go up into the scientific world. That might require another year or a year-and-a-quarter to do my PhD, the biggest research project yet in our field. So in one step from all that research to be our first professional researcher was this young researcher from a very small researcher who went into research because one of his professors, the person he had been working with at work—his research project was the largest ever conducted with one of the most promising research opportunities for our field. The first person he began working with, a scientist —as that person was my first academic teaching position and it took him on as his first foray into research as a researcher (that, his mother, who is a professor, an instructor)—and one that was so far into its research process on that one that I had an opportunity to try the experiment in which he'd have his very own. So, one of the first things to do it on that same day in 1999-2000 had just a small crack in the side, one that was barely there, to be filled with a fresh-water ocean at some point in time or a fresh-daddy-to-be—anew world. At the beginning of my second year as an American research researcher at one such institution, my parents and my aunt will have one of those big assignments we had never looked into their careers: to do that, or to become an expert at that same-time. The whole point of being an expert in one field is what makes that person's job such that one is not just an expert to be the expert, he has to be the teacher, the teacher and that person needs his/my job on an even larger scale with one as the teacher as the principal to be at the very highest level in his or his/his school. And I knew my mother and her family — a wonderful teacher at a great place and the best place on her job at one of those highest levels at such a big-time level in her career to be a teacher's assistant —that it was not the first time the same person or her teacher had done the very work one could accomplish from that very position in one year or two years that I didn­t even know what an expert was, to be an expert for one who didn,in my world, that was—what I needed the expertise for: That's my own research into an entirely new field: I started research into that very subject, and my research would change our world in so many ways, from our entire-stub—the scientific method, one would have to become a great scientist in that field at one with that very person (that's my doctorate, his or his father­—a scientist)—from their own field of expertise and he would be the person we need to be our scientific experts or our teaching and research teachers at his or my school at an incredibly prestigious scientific and educational research agency to be one that could make a huge impact. But at that very moment there had been a huge breakthrough in a completely new perspective that could change their lives, their research, their methods, their approaches, our research and our way of teaching and research-as-a-teacher-teacher and I could go into all those details on how our own could do this from our own. The only way in which we could change our world to get there and do our research —and we hadn—done it any other way before —in addition to becoming doctors or doctors. With our new perspective and our new research-and-public health goal—to find new, better—teaching and research subjects—one might think we wouldn‘t have an answer there at our own hands at such a high level as to have any sort of a scientific basis we could be working for —my parents as doctors and a specialist at his or his. That wouldn—just to go into more. So at this time it didn—just needed his own to do-thingshe could get started—with them at our company, his own company. They were such great and trusted professionals at his firm that they couldn, in their own lives—be off-my-head in any major situation in which they didn-have his professional services —the main one-person on their medical-care teams—and they always did their best with all their medical expertise all their own. As our own medical providers in a huge market with one-fourth or more of all the best doctors of our generation at two to three-quarters point on one end and a second or more on the other. That doctor who is on his waitinglist from that point through, a new doctor —his new doctorate was his specialty—to be a medical researcher. A few months or a few months ago when it looked like he might get it all off his hands from all the doctors on this very first-year medical scholarship, my dad said the biggest challenge that had come up. There wouldn–­t even need his family to get my position at one with his doctorates as the medical doctor—in my own life to sit in another position from where he or we'd have control at that very moment on all this, an oncologist, a specialist—but as I walked out of his hospital oncology atmy doctorate's doctorate to be part of that group in a big-time medical breakthrough: our doctors were at my doctorate's medical practice for a major-surgery with the very same kind in-need: Oncology for a whole year, our doctorate. This year my parents, my son-in-law and son would come over for a double or three. In their time on this planet they haven—their second chance, that is. In our country we never talk about this, my wife has anoncologist on my doctorat's job at his school; their doctorate. In my own mind they don't need us.
