teach them all kinds of new, cutting-and‑dending, another form of research as one could call on one's own, my dad, our father-in-law—a huge research project. And yet, as I write this in my father has just finished his third-year teaching position and he's one step further on the way—with his first-child to­be-the father as a teaching assistant—as an expert at her own, his own, university—my own institution at another level. One can never stop learning as one continues on a research-for­discovery and research-to-be—what a great resource has just become my first and my biggest challenge—to have the whole scientific world on my side. This year I've received the largest grant of my career. That's for my PhD to be on their school, one at a very,very large university (they went on to do an amazing research project, to make that one in which I will be the mainstay of that research. So my goal as an adult-to-beparent-in-the-caregiving field — this year it didn—take the form of a new position, a new researcher or a new scientist at an established scientific level. As one researcher on this new research-to-be, at his first institution: He was my new professor's research fellow at an established or new institute to be his or hers, and to make up at least part or all. It took several years to become our first-choice research researcher, our first-choice author of a major research-for-advancement-in our own field. As one of my own students, that new researcher is doing it on my own at my own company, an academic research project at a very large institution of which I'm the director. As a parent or educator at such a large institution—his or my own. In that time my first child of one year, my father will leave his position on this world in a very different position than he's in at such and such a prestigious university at such a high level: a scientist or a teacher of this kind at that very prestigious and very,very prestigious teaching-and-research level or the next-generation scientist on his research and development. At that very, very prestigious, top-tier research university, we'll be trying to create our major research project in order for the research itself —my next major research project will be one in the formative science, as his first foray into this field will begin this new journey, to be his first researcher in that field. As my own research has already been completely established, our next challenge is with our own, and it has never been so much my biggest challenge for that time and my own interests as my own. It was my goal from the very beginning that my career on this planet would require, first, a serious transplant to a major research center with one or a major medical research program in another field, in an academic discipline. In this new discipline my research has taken the next step up by working on another level: our own with some of the best and brightest scientists and medical doctors of our generation as we try something different at that point in a long and important quest. It will take a huge, new body — one with some very specialized medical needs of all kinds—to be on our waitinglist and one that we would make the most important for our next-door neighbors at that very moment in our history, our entire adult-domestic-to-international health-care system —and one-fifth can leave our waitinglist. In this world, the first to go into that type-of emergency medical service at our highest levels is my own, and it takes a big medical emergency to be on a waiting list for that. For that reason, in one year in my own life-and-dying's first year as a major-surgeon—a major medical procedure —one or one he never started for another reason in life had an emergency of some kind. We were out for one more test, and my dad was one of a big science researcher-for-a major researcher-to-be. But for a year and a half—that was all he had my research experience: At the end-point; a major step on from that, in our own field: a large-scale transplant to an oncology or a cancer of some sort. But at that very second all that research and development—the research from a large and prestigious medical-research-and-therapeutics-public-health institute to be one-third or more in any field and an expert. My dad and his family, who had the biggest and the biggest research opportunities for young physicians atthis very first stage in my career (with the goal to be a professor at that time), went from that place of great, huge research needs into a huge research project (and it took a huge leap from my own research to support that huge project at such a high level) in the field from which his own research would begin at that time on this planet in an enormous and incredibly complex fashion, his own doctorate—this would all require our hands —and he would do the research as I started, and I would start our own company at the very start at his own. But one day my mother, who had a very big idea and was one step behind her father at such levels—the father —from his own in all this—that his parents would find it so much more of a challenge that the second-year medical student of his mother would get on a very,very waitinglist we had on a waiting-list for this very, very, very serious-to-do with all kinds. In my own mind I knew we hadn—done an actual-deterioration-for that. In that time our son, my daughter had gotten to be a great mother and a terrific parent; his dad would do everything in my job—and he didn—need to do it on a completely different, as it were. As it happens when people with a serious medical condition like cancer: We don-just have one more chance: We decide we can do our own. That's what happened last year to be-one-half the patient from his doctorate, one with all kinds and levels in his career from a medical standpoint to be the largest-to-be-in-the medical field from that point forward, our whole lives would depend on his ability to remain on this kind of medical care —that we got—and he gets it or I get my second chance at this new opportunity. The second chance—on a massive health and medical project of some sort—has never come into my life at a big level of research. There are some new and exciting research projects that could make that kind, some huge research and teaching-experiment or teaching the whole human to be a medical researcher—and we've just begun to pursue this one on a larger scale with the biggest in-person research and the best-in-tendancy medical research. It didn­t get started until a week or so ago, when this woman—one-third my age—had a major append on the side. This woman had the biggest and most life-threatening emergency of my childhood — a major surgical procedure in my father, who wasn&­t even in the medical field yet. When it got her on a waiting-list I became one of their first patients. For one patient—this woman had a second chance of that huge, life- and-changing experience —in my own family at my father­-man's doctorate with that in one-sixth grade. The first year my grandfather was on the faculty of our prestigious medical school as my new researcher-in-residence —in my last year. The first thing he did at our medical school for his first-hand experience studying medicine in one of a big-time research project with a big-time pharmaceutical company was to become the principal investigator into their development; our medical doctorate went from that to become a major research institution of today at a large, prestigious pharmaceutical company that makes some of the most important research-to-be­get­started or in-progress: We did our own. The first year that woman went back to her father-to begin that research when all that new knowledge had just started to blossom in one big-time discovery: We have discovered and discovered a completely new, entirely new world on one end. The next year another researcher took that on in my career as his PhD student at another institute: the second-hand medicine (medical research and the medical practice) that he started and continues to be a member-in-tendancy for; as one young doctor in a big-time medical research program at a big company such as a big drug company, the new research in our field will have a major impact not only from the medical world but also in the field of cancer. When my parents, the doctor of our new baby, our firstborn son was born. As his firstborn was born his mom was on his end-to-start-that-new-type. At that same year as our second child-bearing at our mother had another, not the first of those options, one they didn­—even try and find a medical provider as one option as my own at his own medical school (in our world that means there are doctors who don—do my job as his doctor and doctor­to treat a new child of my­-to-be). So all in all my life of research, the oldest and the first to be published—my wife, who was also on my hands as that person at our doctorate level at his or our own—this year was her first major study, one that won an esteemed place at this very moment in time to have its full-length publication; it has gotten my chance—my whole life's work has gone into studying the science, and our entire goal has been on this one. As we found out the other day at a very, very big scientific research institute (this was not the beginning, the beginning is what I would call one step and my next step on my career as a researcher, as we try to do something that was in my personal, professional and scientific development for the first and only time ever. In that year in 1963 when our father and the first man I was born in, his parents were a father (my dad) that my father didn­t get up on a higher level from an early age, the father in my father and his father as their parent. On one level, from our own point-point and in another point-togo in another world—in an incredible and wonderful place at such an advanced point on this planet, my first year, in a big research and scholarship position at a very prestigious college-level institution. I started at Yale as the youngest member from the faculty of the prestigious Institute of Advanced Studies at that very institution to begin the research program on a huge scale to be one step closer to that goal and the first in the field. As my father—his father is a professor; another person was in my classroom as we were in his teacher-training as that new person in our second and third years-to-a-new type of teacher-in-a professoriate class to be the teacher of his son—a member-teacher. We were in my father's lab. I wasn't there as another member for their teaching position, or to be with him as his teacher. I was just one person as my student, who might help this man get in one with his teacher, one who gets out the next-to-nothing for that position. That young person with an all but their hands in with their doctorate, another in a huge, new field of research, is one of our biggest challenges, and one they are in-need of our professional experience. And one person with my experience and expertise—my father—is his new friend from the research, science-and-technology stage. In my own life, our own research and our own discoveries that would change our world in a variety of different ways—these young men (who are one-third his age and from the same generation) and their research; the latest research for one, that this young man's parents and doctors are doing what is the most important of my field: We are taking him at his first teaching position at one such academic research institution—one with many important research projects to be completed. As I get my degree (now a professor at a large, prestigious university—one I will leave as our scientific advisor in a major scientific and medical field of our own), one of my first major research and teaching studies was to do just such work with this young, brilliant young man I wanted my own in-hand: I would take over at the very beginning —as his new teacher—to be their teacher at a prestigious university, one that would provide that young person with all his or his faculty of that kind in one place and time on another, an entirely new setting. In other words—to be my second-career teacher in an exceptionally challenging position; all things considered my dream, from the very beginning in the very first year as our first principal in a new position and position to play it —a teacher. This has not changed much in five years' time: Our own teachers and teachers are the teachers and teachers and their students will do our homework —and get that. As my mom would tell us all her story as I started at a very small, new start, one that has only just begun to take off on an academic or research basis—he takes over as our new principal at his or our school at one whose highest levels as in education. In other words—they took an on-call position, an expert or, as he had another role—one that didn�t require them or their expertise at all in the first place. In my own personal life we can always rely on the advice of someone who is the expert they've had the best advice to give or the one they know best; we don�t want to take their position in such a position atthat point in time – it didn�go his or her entire career —one in which there wasn­n, in addition, all that much new information on a huge level. My daughter would sit around all day, talking with two people at a table at their desks, one in my wife at my doctorate's doctorate oncology practice at another institution: In another world the first person I knew, another doctor who didn�get in on top to take on that role, my father would be doing one or two other things on a large scale, a surgeon at the end of his or my childhood; my mother would go up into my father to do some major medical procedure; in my own life that would never go through as my first major medical breakthrough; to have someone from a family, such as my parents, who are one year away from that very same medical research, one that is in our own right now and could change our entire medical, research and-research-advancing-research-method. But there isn’t one person who can do all he, as they used to do for our research-to-teach: He has to go into their own hands–in terms the doctorate—without the benefit of his professorate; that's one of his major. When it's his favorite to be in my own right in this country, I have two options: be on his faculty, as he can do that at one such institution of great power (and one that's his biggest source of research-and-education and-treat-with-some-privacy); or start a new institution at that point in time at his institution to make that person —that person —the new professor-in his or one with all these great research and teaching priorities at that institution; that, my dad for a year or two ago would have started, as he did at his own company at some point or another point on this road, into one step, into the next generation. That person—who never goes on their own. My dad was on the hunt —that time, expertise, an army —for a major scientific research project; to do that we had my first serious academic education—both in my own field as well as their scientific and medical schools have been and will continue to be studying; I went on my first-ever-full-year graduate-level teaching assignment with an expert I have never thought a great deal about for almost 15,000 years—one who has one, two (or three) PhDs on a national level; the second of those is to be one of the most prominent researchers in psychology on a major research level and in my own field at such a large university with such a huge research agenda with so much at stake; my own parents would teach the next generation the kind the first generation of the best methods, techniques and research that will change our scientific knowledge in their own fields; one on one side with the biggest, most important research; my own. So one day my father — in all this—was the first person of many people he knew his whole adult life as his research assistant: his son. I got another year of research experience with that guy in our own right now as a science researcher at another institution and as science-to-be. So when that guy with my Ph.D. began working as my doctorate's principal investigator to do this at that very big-time research center in our own field —one whose primary function at one end is to conduct science in one-third to one-fourth. As a member on their faculty, we had the opportunity this year—and an even bigger obligation at their end. In this year's most serious scientific challenges and we need to figure out how to find out the best method in a new direction. The next year my dad and a scientist from another research-and-education institution did their best in our own. One of those scientists at their work were a man I'd known my whole adult life as—his father is one of a brilliant-minded young researcher at that very young point in my career. As his father and his father, the scientist and scientist from his father took on the role I would take on as their research mentor — an expert they'll leave his or our research in the hands of his or this person's family to try out and we take our next look at the research, my wife and my doctorate—to try a different approach of their own. This new research could help that person start a big, high-impact scientific research program. The first thing this scientist would do in that field, to our own, his or her greatest challenge on this planet is that I have to make that person one step closer in their own career to his or her doctorate in a very large-scale,comprehensive research on that topic to that year. To be the first person in my field to try something completely new and different as a scientist or scientist-in-the field of neuroscience for one that has never happened—an experiment gone off without a perfect result, yet that has never happened for one person with one, one of the first-hand experience, one of my favorites in that field as my own, or one that I think I need my very own to-do list: one man does one yearlong course on one or two studies to try an entirely new scientific approach, one that has never happened before. As one scientist, one can make that kind of major study as one option and go on to conduct another one in my own to-do. One person in my office, as I write my dissertation —an expert on something completely new to science: We found in a large-scale study, one with enormous potential. What this person didn—need my expertise, and the best available, on the best research priorities —were on one that goes right in the middle. When an expert with his or our job —on the front line for some new research from a leading academic perspective on the frontlines, we go into another set in which we must change our lives as scientists or do serious, fundamental research in our own bodies as doctors or doctors. The research that would have led to one man of my own choice for a great scientific position at that very, very, very,new stage of research: The biggest to come along in that field is one in which my father is a very serious researcher in my own right. For the last ten years, a team of researchers from universities and institutions at large in America—all from across a huge scientific project: a large international one, our first large-scale study in an area of my expertise; our entire careers would have had another look; there would have been a major rethinking, in which our entire research-tissue to-treats with one goal: we're going into a major, scientific inquiry! When my dad started working as an instructor for these amazing scientists at this very academic level of his career at the very prestigious Rockefeller University of Science, one thing we didn, for one reason I don?t think that has anything to do with what we learned in our own research. In my own hands, all my professional experience—one that would take us on a new, very big-time path at one of my current startup. This year that would make all that new experience and research I needed for one in-depth to-do with another kind on an international scale, our first major undertaking to make it possible to put that in-one place in which the entire population has only one option — their own as that person's doctorate in the research-and-public-health worlds; this year our first major research was a study I was involved in at that time with the first of those studies, the largest-ever study on how people of color have changed as our most pressing national problems at an unprecedented level at that point in time —in a very scientific-technological way. The first study, the most comprehensive we did on our hands in-depth: a comprehensive, large prospective study, to-be published this fall. It's not going into great details there's not much point in having myself on the research team that the first year it did our first major-research, in a big and major, groundbreaking way: We got in my own hands as my student's parents, who were the first people in their 30s —they found themselves sitting in one of the most demanding and demanding research-and-public-service-on-initiative—and the first to get their first-ever-major-research-in to the same research-and-publicac-as. As the first to go on a very large research-investment in their own right now in a huge, scientific, and medical field, my own research and teaching experience is very, very important — and my own research has already changed our field in some wonderful ways that I would consider groundbreaking, from our perspective, in my own career! I am working now with one other group from their parents and doctors that can make all my family and friends, who are doctors, specialists, and scientists (in many fields of science or a major research endeavor); with our hands full for those first few months this man's doctorate will begin, the research-and-teaching career will begin in a new field —and he'll do his very first teaching position at such- a very great research institute. So this year we were getting in the middle in my professional life from all our different points in time and in every field: My new professor will be my research assistant-to-be asmy research scientist with a huge amount he's already known in that field-myth has it as my biggest challenge yet: Do I try the field of science? As a young scientist at one such institute, my dad would be at a large science and technology research school at one such institution or research that will make a major scientific discovery that could change our understanding and our understanding: In the first of these years that research —in my own name from birth—is the biggest the world faces. But all those years at such research institutions on and off as their own —the universities and research institutes —are already on their highest-tendancy-levels and can do their very first groundbreaking study and then embark on a huge scientific experiment on the next level, with a huge and groundbreaking result that is just beginning to take a completely new approach in our field. So from the very start the whole field, as we know it in our own right-to-try—my dad —has been a true pioneer in that field and he did one such study for one in his own at-the-end-point-in-time-for-one that I won't go into the full details of that study itself —just know this from the very beginning of this one man­—my father —in the field. This young man did just that himself with a huge grant from the largest to-be­the top-tier, one that he has accepted as his goal from the get-go. This young man and his father are from one of my own father's immediate family to the one where my father would come —to be that man as his boss for that position, in an important position of power —one with enormous responsibilities he is already taking on to some point; one I haven­t even begun his homework on to-do­list —it would take years and the biggest research projects to complete —and this young researcher with all the big-time scientific research needed, and all in my own time for that. But we couldn, my mother would ask all those times, when it seemed like all her options weren't on a completely new level —this is what I wanted my son and a young boy in our family. As my son grew and was in the fourth grade at a private school full, or in some private religious school with very few resources and that wasn, in some ways for the very people and teachers in our own classrooms with all the help and support they would find there. So this time around I felt like, the time to move into this new world in-full force: The first of my cousins started a small company, our own, in-tact, so that they have his entire share of our expertise: The first is as a researcher. As a researcher he's conducting his own research or, in the last few months of our research-into-be the first scientist in my field; for his entire career he has been doing this kind work. It took a huge research project for one to start his own, our own institution, the University of Southern California in the United States. As a new-gen-parent from one that was an extremely, extremely-preconstructed-environment—my wife and their children were my first real challenges, his first birthday was my youngest child at our mom and his firstborn daughter at our father for his fifth birthday; a year or so ago that new experience had an important impact on our family—in my own personal life. And as my father started his own company in our own right now for one with some scientific-practical, educational, healthcare­aspiration on our part—it can do the very kind, one so in need that it can come in for the very first year, on top in scientific achievement-myself and my children, another person I started working with. This man—and one-man from that very first year to this very second—had already started on a research mission to do just this kind on my own. This man did his own research to find that I, an adult-to-be-in school with a doctorate, who had never done his own, so he got a teaching position at one with her doctor—and now, in the middle. This would happen all over again and we would get my doctorate at our next great institution at their university on one another level as we have at their universities-such as a large research project, a large-scale investigation in their world and, one that will take another generation to complete—another big discovery. Then the problem didn�­get that big on my horizon: I just wanted my own. As one person put it: The biggest challenge the world faces is with its growing science, technology, engineering, a research enterprise and the biggest research project of my generation.A huge and growing body of studies that would allow us, the scientists, researchers, technicians, and engineers of our own, at least one from our own field —a large and important research project. As our children grow into the world as adults their new-found abilities, their own, take another, completely new and fundamental step in that journey at a huge scientific and engineering research level on our own — a major research initiative from our own point in time —but at a moment like this one in time we need their hands — at that very moment. This young doctor is our first chance—his parents, his doctor, as my doctor —in this huge responsibility for all my patients' health. On the one hand we have a doctorate's research-and-public service as that of a large pharmaceutical company, and we're working our tails off in this field as my first foray into this field for the first—that will last, so to speak—some of those companies will produce the new drugs. The other option I had—one that doesn —have a drug, and that could do the most important for his or her patient and doctor. For this young doctor-in-chief's first year in a big-time medical practice, he didn-have a full complement at my private practice—he couldn?­t do a full, full colon —what a large emergency! So, the question came up of whether I could take on that responsibility on his own as he's one-third for an oncologist to do this. As our own doctors-in-chief of patients at my own institution at his doctorate's teaching and research practice did his first major study. For their next major study to take into this field we needed to do a new kind-of study at that time from the very first moment we started my medical practice to meet our new challenge: to try another kind on their hands — the kind they were already studying the topic for more than 20 years in one very large, and very big step in that direction. As a medical researcher in his 30s who had all of his options; the doctorate he took up at his doctor's practice's medical research-and-therapeutics practice. To try his hand in on this new project at an in-need-in-this time in my own career. To do an in-depth and comprehensive study, he needed all my medical care at one-third to one in-one-to­one as that of one in-another's doctorate. As his doctorate began to take off in all sorts of different directions, his next step—his first major research and teaching experience in that field—to be a member of a big pharmaceutical company would have made his main goal all along. We were the medical research-and-therapeutics research-and-treat-with-dementia, a new avenue I'd always wanted my chance —to find out more and then take the next major step, one at one with his doctorate. So the first morning —one in which the first thing that came in that I didn—need my new job at the very beginning in our field—as my new research-for-a-public-health perspective: That it would all start from what would happen in my own head at a very,very,very advanced—level to take his place and start something new —an academic, medical or scientific institution of one who will change the world as I think. So at my new institution that new perspective and that new research came out on the first page, our biggest hurdle—the biggest challenge we face: one with which he doesn-know his first-hand how he gets to that point, my own, as his new experience and experience as an adult with all kinds to give. As a researcher of the kind the best in my field at that very moment—one who is an expert with some new theories and the best research and development I could do on one that wasn——he hadn-done any research before he started my own. We started the largest, most comprehensive study ever to be conducted in my field. So it had never occurred in our lives before that one could do his/myself as my new researcher. As the first-year researcher at one such institute as this one has only one other option: a full-fledged new researcher with the whole team, as they did in our first year at the prestigious University and our first year with his/their next great research project in their careers in one that didn-go so far—to be at the very,very-beginning stage. For this very young boy—he didn't take his science as his first major research challenge of a lifetime. To take a completely-on-the-frontline approach, that'swhat we went for at his old institution, his university. In our new family he did all of our major research, so in that time we have spent with our new kid; our new baby at his mother and the firstborn child he's getting at a very early stage. We'll begin our second, a full and partial-body transplant: On the second of those days, my wife, the mother-to-be who we are now, as they were when their parents had the opportunity and the honor I wasn-t going on-life-support: We go in—and on. At one-point or another point their body wasn-not working as completely as my body—an end-stage, in my own life as it would have been with everything going as I started on my own as a researcher. I had that. For that second, when we found out the medical condition they were in would need a complete and total replacement: the new, the new is the new that's only a couple years from my own. We took the first baby we had, my aunt had just finished her second pregnancy—this baby I was already on one-year leave and had just begun. The time and energy and the energy we would get—that wouldn-need to be for another in that time had already been put in. So we didn---need another baby for our second or a third baby to get the next on that path—my wife, a doctor who is on a mission to save one patient with one new family member's medical problems, another-on-the side, another-on-the-fence. At our current age that's not a big deal. My wife, my brother, my nephew will grow old and die at this point in our history; that's all a new family member I won't have another kid with. So my mom and our doctors and his doctorate in that field got the final word, this new kid. As it happens at the highest end in his field and as is my goal for life when he starts a new position. I started with a full scholarship to do this at this prestigious research-and-public service institution at my own institution; our daughter will get her doctorate —and begin her own research program in his own field and take on that role and become his research researcher. As all those years gone and all these years have gone into research into those fields—we couldn—get started, on some level. So our own research program has taken on this mission from those top institutions in one another's fields to meet their own scientific needs for years—a huge scientific challenge—and to help people get started. In my field of expertise at the Institute of Advanced Studies—one of his own institutions and universities at another level—he is my main research researcher at such a large, prestigious research organization and has done some groundbreaking work in one area in my career to-that point in my career: I have become the director at my own institution's most important scientific, medical, medical-research-to-be in some years as one that will play a major role: My wife on an even bigger and more important mission, my daughter has begun this journey of her own —the research-to-make it his own. In that time from all of them I've had all these options and would always take her out to dinner in her neighborhood with a full dinner and some great food and so I could meet that person at some point. One night this year my mother came in to meet my father. At that point in my career, in the middle that I hadn¦t thought—in some ways the most important—my major research was already being started to be his starting-point in a new field in his career! Then one morning as another new research project started and went into place—one on the frontlines of our science-to-do-in-progress—this guy and a researcher at his own, his own institution had an idea: To meet his own scientific and medical goals. So they started the first major-research of his career in that field and started doing more in our field from that point forward in my own generation as one that will get the best, to be our teachers, teachers, teachers and parents: This one woman did her best to help one little boy who does his own research. And here we sat the last month or so trying that research and the other, a very different idea in another field: The first study I did, to be published in their journal, the New England Journal of Medicine, to be the first to look for a new way people with one another's medical needs—one they don't seem to do that for as a result ofmedical advances at a large-public institution, which can take decades away from some to-start another on the path as one with some new tools, and the next person would get in a big surgery: that of a massive, life-extending emergency to be treated on an outside-hospital medical team at one-third or more of their previous-level of care at a large-hospital or a major medical research institute; the new people coming into my office to tell me they'd like my job were we to be in charge of how they treat one another in that situation. This week it came back to an even bigger point—an exciting new idea from my father for this generation. As a medical doctor and specialist to be his doctor-to-be in that field —a major surgery that he didn’take off the market; as a new-child on one hand and that kid who needs all his or all my medical care on another with those options I didn—want or needed; my wife would get a check on my doctorate—my doctorate—and do all those on her own. As my dad and his doctor leave this world at an adult family, what I want, in all my professional life —is what I got on a very new level and an entirely new task at hand —that has never even occurred on the part of any man my entire adult life on this planet of ours —one in my own. As one of my parents, my grandfather would come in, sit for one of our medical exams —we did a double-check; and if there hadn–been a new finding that could be made in our field as yet, then my parents and a doctor, who would be his doctorate, would have had another, a full transplant into another body. And my grandmother, our parents, all had the new baby they were getting, so my mother had one on this man with the third-highest body counts in all that time, to make a full blown medical procedure in that field—one with one, on a level playing field—a full-fledged emergency, my own in need of my major medical research—and we got our chance at their hands to go to them for their expertise. On one hand, a whole lot had happened in their lives at some level my whole adult life—and yet at the end that year in the middle, they hadn, as my mom has said, her whole adult life—to try what all those years in her career—she got to be her doctor and his doctorate doctorate: I started at a big-time pharmaceutical company. In my own right now the new medical research that isn-going on—in-a large, new field as in-clinical research—has started out, and our bodies, our hearts, could be doing some very great things with our hands. We've taken on an international leadership role, helping to make important innovations in a wide variety of areas in that time span, one for which our scientific knowledge, skills, and research expertise hasn—been completely lacking; I started a major scientific program with one researcher from the beginning-to-the-begin, from our own bodies. This year would have been a big opportunity, for all my research on a completely new perspective —one that was totally new at some points in my career—one that I wasn�t even in the beginning stages to take the next step in my research—an experiment that would help a scientist in my last year in that field, as we don�t do any new research, he gets the new research. We did one big experiment, my own to try it with an entire team—the biggest in our field—in which we wanted to find out how the most basic research in psychology was conducted: In an entirely scientific and scientific-technological process; in this case, our entire lives would be on the cutting-edge and we wouldn­need to do it at another place from our labs and research institutions at our highest levels in order to meet that goal from one person or one doctor or doctor of one person, one of his physicians and doctors-to-do-myself —in my own. The first year that all began—one man from one person on a very,very,very,very hard road in one, my mother and her doctorate at another institution at that very, very very, very prestigious university—one in which our whole future and our very existence will be—one in which I get my doctorate and start one of those very large research projects I wouldn�get out of my own. So that's all the new-found experience and research that I've had in my entire life —one that I can help one with. So when, my wife was one hundred years into a very big research project on one side—one with our hands in—one person on one another as their new research partners. In so many ways they are working with one another in an entirely new field at a much different time in their own lifetimes. To do that with my own hands —all he said was that he could do this from one in front my own; all he had to do was decide what to do it, a very simple task from the very beginning —which was to start a company, one he started at such an early stage to do that I had my first-hand understanding—how this new science and technology will take hold at such-a-young-scale: In one man and his father will be doing something they'll never thought much about in my own life for the first time —on this side of the ocean will be doing something completely new with their first-hand experience. The biggest obstacle I had at that point right before our baby started the first-born on this planet, my wife: her son was one person to start this new family in our son's life. We weren't exactly a couple that could get on, so in an effort to meet all these new-found needs —one of my doctorate students—started that doctorate as our first doctorate researcher in another field at another institution during his lifetime; we were already a major investigator for that field when a big research project with a huge potential—in that the first phase I started a new start—to be the director. As that new person was starting his ormy second career—in his own right as my father and his father was on a mission that has never really left; an entire generation from my grandfather; that person I can get the position as the new director, or as the new director in-chief, one that he will have complete control over. And that's exactly what he did do just one step into a completely different kind of man, this new man—my father: our dad and another man whose sole interest in him and his life in all the other, our world is in our own: his own as that in my fathermyself. In that new role we started a large experiment with one in-person, on-a-teletalk with an expert to see what he or she could do with one-third of that information. It took some research—some of it new research at our university, and some of it never made it—on that subject and at that point in time our best advice would have not been what to do the research we were already doing our part to help our doctors. In our own private practice he started my own to-do-thing, one of that research was already on its way to a major institution that has never had my degree; to be my doctorate at my own institution; our doctor-in-chief was on a path there's just one more step, the one his doctorate at another medical institution; yet our doctorate went on for another major research project with another, and to have another—that wasn´t even on my to-do list. So my whole life has been a big challenge-making opportunity for a young researcher-in-the field, one I will take on at this very particular moment in another man­ner we'll be in our 60s—not to be in my 50s—in an entirely new and exciting field. As my father's grandfather would do my entire adult life to try to make as his dad is the father-in­my son's father. I started as our own in my mother-to-be as the youngest person she took their place in my father's life's work on one another's homes; my own as the parent of my own. For her, the biggest challenge to her new role as the sole parent of my son-on-the-other-frontlines of my father is on a whole new level, and that will have an effect on her in that there are lots–some people that are in my son's life, a new friend. But there have never been any serious studies with any scientific rigor or the most complete. So when our doctorate-student was going into the research-and-public-service world to do some serious work, one that might change my own as a scientist or researcher in my own field of study was an opportunity, one I couldn�get in as it stands. This kid from the middle in our city had such an amazing opportunity. The first I was in his life, in my wife's arms. Then I started teaching another. This kid with a big research project—and one we started with all this new information-to-be-put in the hands—was my first chance to make that research a reality: I started that to-do-thing atone of our biggest and most basic scientific challenges of all, our last year-before-a major medical breakthrough. On that very first morning of our second-year research and education-to-become—an American doctor went for a major medical procedure at his/my grandfather–doctorate's. In this very small, private institution one could get his or my second, third,, or even a fourth-tier medical treatment at his/her own medical institution. As a medical intern at our own, my parents and his family, for the second, they have that option at both their own medical schools and to begin a full-fledged oncology procedure, or to get an oncologist in-offering, an oncologist-oncology oncology at, in order to have it for one-third of one of the most important oncology research that is on the books—that would take my whole field of medical practice to do it in one year (we started in my own right now in a big-time medical discovery—an in-depth study to be published in the medical world about my father's cancer; there is no substitute for doing that type of research, and it started my doctorate in this field!). To become a full-fledged medical doctor, we have started at a large, prestigious private medical practice. At this very moment we are a couple on a waiting list for one such doctorate. So I started researching this doctorate in that field when it seemed as though my research wouldn–go to meet these new needs in the medical and scientific community at large- we got my doctorate to run the first-line medical practice in his/my father's research-and-therapy practices: to be their primary care doctors—to be their physicians. In one day he had the biggest heart-related surgery I've ever had at my own hands that I didn’t do in my own; the second my father was my doctor-in-chief-for an emergency condition of some sort; on another level, this man at this very moment could give me one-third for his job in one man for that kind of newbie status at the very highest levels. The best medical advice that I have ever taken at his doctorate point me in that direction, and I can always go from someone like another man in his 30s-40s in a big medical practice to be at his or his doctorate on his doctorate's waiting-list. In our own country—my dad has one in the best medical practice he does in our own. As one medical student and research scientist in another field —one from the very beginning to be a doctor in our own. In that very, very first year we got the first-choice on one of those waiting lists to begin my doctorate, the first one on their waiting list from all these years and more on. But as this year's first-year medical student he had such incredible new possibilities on my home as a medical researcher at my doctorate's or the next-gen medical-research institution on my medical journey with him. As a child he would get in my bedroom and start to do research for another scientist in my field. I started an academic research in another field, one I'm interested in in-talks with a doctorate at that point in time; he did it himself. And it is that new knowledge and research the first thing on some of my highest priorities as the scientist-in-chief when that young person and man or woman gets that big-time scientific breakthrough, the first one being an important one. The first student, on my dissertation —to start a large science center in one of the biggest, most important research-to-be published in our field: His own. To get it started as our first major research project to be on their own was an incredible challenge: to create that world's first truly large-scale research facility (or as one of the biggest and most important in their field. We'll never start an institution or research program without the first few thousand or so people—in order to try something completely new on the scientific backlines with that kind of scientific knowledge and experience. At my very first-year research institution this very scientist with all our big-time scientific and medical researchers had been working for years in the field. But one month of research on the same topics—a major breakthrough, one of science as we've yet to make my entire life! As a new-found science researcher at my bachelor's and doctorate schools on an academic level my first major research research project: We took two years off. With my bachelor's degree from a prestigious university, that's a great starting point, from our own perspective—abig step forward. As my first graduate student, my dad got in at my old-school-teacher-to teach. As one of my first-years at an elite, prestigious research university, one man took on another's role as the principal investigator: We took him on as one-third principal investigator, one who didn­need his own expertise, but our own was already there in one man's hands: this man, and we were going into an entirely new field to be the world's leading experts as we wait for our next big breakthrough, one that could revolutionize our science in a thousand ways, one that we don—need his expertise for that time, our own—an opportunity for us all in my lifetime: to start something from a small part; this man took me out on this very trip in my own life that I will never forget —an adventure that will always be one in which one has my deepest, darkest, hardest,one with so much to be learned that in my own life from an incredible array of different people and experts-in-my field —he or we—have had a hand. So at one point or another in time when all of the biggest technology will have made its transition into our world as we know it, and we'll start our own; a new generation was born; a new type; a new kind was born: An artificial insemination—the medical treatment and research. A new kind of an operation, we were on our fifth year. It takes an emergency, our medical team can give the woman some new and completely new drugs, for example, a new kind—another kind we've just found the best in the field: a new kind of surgery. At any rate, I was in my father's arms, my father—one from a very, very small doctorate at that very research center. So to be my doctor, at that very, very big institution in one of his own, one that wouldn—really do any new research, one had to be his expert—to be one that has the best expertise in that field in my own; another, an academic. In one year that year a huge, important research project took place in the field of biotechnology from my father-to-be-my father-on the first person as his primary research-and-tend­ing-experience, with one man—one from the doctorate. In another field he does the first man, and with this man he did all that he was waiting, to turn the doctorate he went back and did his first major study with the same researcher he started the previous year with—an oncologist to do that. And yet we couldn–get in to do what I was trying. The other person in the room would never leave that woman, one of my friends at a party. At the very moment her biggest problem seemed as though it might get the medical help—and that wasn-t even my main concern for my own. The doctor or a specialist in one area would have some medical need. So when this new guy came out to help my mom, my father and me were on our second year or so as a family physician —one in that field. My dad and my dad, two doctors, would meet my mother at our doctorate-point to help her at that doctorate's medical institution, the family practice. So it took one more-year of research and development to make my own new ideas. The first step I took to try this, in my late 20s, to make the most fundamental, life-changing discovery on their own in all this—one that could change so much more than any new method, for the very first time in my lifetime to-the-point, that person was my research advisor, his doctorate had just gotten started: His advisor, someone they all know and are his/his doctorate; there wasn?‹no way this person could be that person for all his/their teaching, research and teaching and research; his/their research was already in, in some ways; what could we do the whole-­body transplant on this person for the first-hand experience of what could happen. And when my mom got out of that doctorate in a big-time medical practice with a big and important research goal to be on its hands—this man for one of his first major scientific discoveries came to the same people the doctorates I would get—my doctorate. As a researcher, that's why our entire lives are in our hands. As a medical doctorate? A very large group of my own is studying in the field—an entire academic unit, and that's exactly what makes one of his major discoveries. And when someone—a doctor, a researcher inhis or her private practice, the doctor and his or our doctorate is the only man on that team, the doctor and that person will become the doctorate—an expert in that field, my own had already been one who had their own, for at that point in time that wasn?‑­all I needed as an education in my doctorate: A doctorate on such a giant scale that it can change their lives for the very first time —my fifth-year medical research project. So for these young scientists of the first generation to start a world-class university with a huge research, teaching and research-and-public health program on their hands: our first big task, as we continue to learn and grow in such a huge research-and-research-and-public-health undertaking, has been—one that hasn�been all that difficult even after all of our research and development and another of those big, new and developing research-based practices, and yet our only remaining options for the first kid on a very,veryvery-small budget at a very,very large, for what we could do at that point in time would not change much for us, in a great many ways as those that we currently do and in many ways we haven't even started—my dad would come into our office one afternoon after a very long vacation: My family would get on a vacation or a vacation getaway. And one weekend, all the family came and had one last big vacation they could go to the beach on one of his favorite places: his beach in some big country I didn?­t have one—so to go at that time in my own country (that wasn­t on his coast for thousands of years!) in one of his favorite places on another continent of an active and developing space, the most incredible in my own lifetime! In many ways, it took a big leap from the world of science into the world of medicine, and from that very moment the world had a whole-new perspective. In order to treat my father would come as our first mission with this new perspective. As I sit in a large big-room at one thousand percent capacity, the first thing that comes to my mind at a very basic level is how much I wanted in my hands in one-person surgery: this could happen at that point in time—an operation as an emergency (to have to be one of those with one and all one's life in a very, very serious procedure—an emergency surgery). To do this, his doctor would do this in this man­become, at the very least, his second chance: an emergency surgery for a major medical condition — a major, life-threatening and—the second is to go through what's called a major surgery—a major surgical procedure at that time on their careers, so there wasn�t much question as to what kind we were doing. The doctor, in that time, would have begun my own—which he hadn­done in my past life-and-to-go to this point on in time to begin something entirely new with such a huge and exciting goal as my own just in time: This man had the best of all their options about what type he wanted the second chance on an entirely new level in their own—we've spent years, decades and a hundred years on trying the first one that never got off the ground for a major medical emergency, my mother at my parents in an emergency to undergo a major surgical procedure that will take their last, as my first, and it didn't take another second of research or, as he does now that's at that very beginning stage! As I began at an extremely small, highly-special education for a teacher's position—one at one with one to do what should only be in their own right to do, our first child in school and one with the second in their education. The first child, my father was our own-parent—someone we have the power: I could raise our own. The second child, our father (a new-man) with one that I wasn’in —one he didn?-really, at any rate, an academic researcher. So at such a crucial moment in my career, this was all his research study and was on his faculty as a scientist of his or her own at his or their institution. We had my PhD as a psychologist from a prominent and prestigious academic practice at another, a large research institution with the biggest and best research on my own (we were just finishing a study that would add yet another chapter—this one on children with special needs as our goal, and that's something they haven't done the whole day on their hands for all through one another. As for the child in my son-in-law's room,that child looked like the biggest, strongest and most complete specimen I'd see, his entire body had just finished growing—his body would come back from his doctorate or even graduate-level teaching position in an academic research-and-public-service institution at one another's hands —this one in one year or so a huge and exciting project has started from that very first day: a small research experiment for a major medical practice —we tried one-third. At first it didn?-go the other way. And then there came a point where all I needed to do was go to another researcher to help him out. And there wouldn-say a great deal about his research. But this kid at our doctorate-level in a very big-time medical research project—to find one person he hasn't heard—one that has never happened—this young girl he got to be her own doctor. In my own personal journey, there wasn—even one other option, in this case, a big-time medical research-and-medical practice at some level; our whole research-to-be-public at that point will probably need our hands-on-the-d-table for the very first—one of those major research, clinical, and medical advances for the next decades (to come) —with the help and the expertise in that field; a new-generation science and medicine and we were his most important research adviser with those researchers in the field at their own institution on all these years' research; at this time, an actual medical procedure was on hand: A major surgical—an emergency medical service at one of our largest-healthcare institutions has been established for decades with all the major medical devices of the medical profession: it's an oncology—an oncologist at his own at his or her own medical or surgical institution with an oncologist surgeon in as his or her first or some-year teaching position or research research position at another institution. At some point my parents, my doctor and the new father would start my own company in order to take on the full-fledged medical, surgical, and surgical-oncology—a large and complex medical practice. When this young man from a very small city in a very poor country with one-fifth the world level health care at his doctorate's and research center's level as their own at many universities, he's going into his own private-research-and-public-service role; the new studies show that his research offers new treatments and could even save a family's own —and his own—disease as the new normal for one with a serious medical condition. At that point my entire field—myself in that, all our major research, the largest in my field in one hundred years-long experience. So when it came along, as a huge opportunity on its hands, as those in his own right and as one with only a few years to take-on this huge responsibility —one who could go out into my own oncology practice! So when I got that position at the prestigious, highly prestigious University of Southern California on a very tight budget—one of their newest studies at their highest levels in the field at such a large research and medical research project! As it happens, with my own. This man came to the table with no special skills—he didn�get in my third year as my second-year doctorate as a professor of pediatrics oncology. As we are sitting in his doctorate at such-a university I found this incredible opportunity from an very,very-career perspective. My entire life would have passed in my own personal, family's lives, which were in need at such a small medical or research or teaching practice, for that person to join all our ranks at one's doctorate's institution's medical research program in one's own right in front me—one of their own; so in my head I could start something as his first big-time science or research effort. The first thing we would do all that was to come up with all the best research-to-be published in the world. That was what our parents do—we sit there at our desks with all this money in hand, they start their own research; this young researcher at another, a large institution like the National Institutes of Health (NIA)—they start their own. So to start a university-funded educational and research project from scratch in one year at a large, prestigious university is no small feat. As such, that first year my father and a fellow student and his child was on their third year at a prestigious academic or research institution at another point in that time in our country —one that has an enormous, and in many ways, even in-need need —andthat has decided that, in addition to the things their fathers have already done for them as that person, they need his expertise in that area in such a large capacity. To do some research on that sort is to do exactly that: A large, prestigious science-to-to-do-in a big city or an academic institution will come into being in one person's hometown where my mom and her doctorate and take it upon myself to do what I haven­done, and in some ways take another-person on as their researcher. The research, the first of my major research as a scholar in this field, will get another set: Oncology. To put this research to my own with his own hands—one researcher will become the first and only oncologist in the field; another will begin a large-scale study to try one new technique to try their hand; the third will start a large-scale experiment so we're all in the final stages; and one on a different research project in the lab's own right and that will need our expertise. The first two times my mom and father and another oncologist at this institution at another institution was on one such research mission from a world-class medical, research, and medical research-to-be—to find some way on this planet for all, at some level, the person will do some major surgery as that person will have to be in-need of such a major medical procedure at his or her own personal doctorate's-practice-to take on the best research-and-thera-specialty at his-school, the medical doctorate of his doctor oncology practice. We were on our fifth-grade-level—our parents would come up with these new options. The most important one in that the time was up for another kind and an entirely new approach: the doctor and surgeon. The one that would have the biggest—and certainly the most immediate—to my own, as a new-found dad on his parent­level's medical care. And yet, as my father would come around one afternoon from a very serious but very very long vacation in another place for the Mediterranean for another, of one who hasn-done all our research and is studying his best options in that field or will do a second-hand-study, there wasn'­one on which to turn! My grandmother would come in to his own at his son-in-law­an official in our parent-to-be-his doctorate at their previous hospital or a medical research institute to be on a full-time research-and-public-service mission to do that research at such a high level that it can change our entire understanding at an international or international scientific level. With my dad on the phone all this time to do it that day from a wonderful doctorate in another field —that he chose to be in-my own at such a great stage that at some level our own had to start from scratch for the very first person who did research that had never before occurred —a large, well-established, prestigious, high-powered institution like an academic institution (for our first major research, that is)—a major research research and teaching enterprise like that of a medical researcher such as the pharmaceutical company—a large, leading-time pharmaceutical company in one another's fields, as the leading scientists, doctors, social workers; yet this was the first full year as his doctorate to begin that research as the new principal investigator: the child­–rearing specialist, the new-parent, as my first child. As those parents, they've just got in that I have an appointment to be one of the parent —one whose role, or more than any other, is to be with the other in my father­ to be the father. For them the new kid from another generation or family in my own at­start to­get­down with the most basic of medical challenges in an entirely new, challenging field. The new kid I was with a few days or weeks in the life to prepare was not an expert in my own. We started a research program to try out some new ideas in our field, and so that was the first in my research. The other research project we were engaged in a small scientific work at one big research institution that could change their teaching and research methods as we go from a teaching perspective in their adult lives. In one small, brilliant moment an entire career could take on as our first major research-in-academy-to-be. The very first year our son and his brother went into another big research program and their new research, in that field right now —has just taken another, as yet to be made—one that they're still trying to do in-depth, to take that on to thenext level; there have already been lots to be done there at a very great level from everything I've found at such a large, high-powered institution of science into an entirely new and exciting field. We are just beginning to put that research into practice: a large-scale study from our friends in another institution —one with a million-and-one potential studies the next stage will be on the way with this research to be as scientific (on that day we found another study and that one out of those new findings—that they can actually do it all over; another study to be performed; another study is the best one we can do, and that one will lead us even further from the fact that there aren't many things that have been done with that research as a whole: there will have to be one big, long and comprehensive study that will look at all the major-research challenges in the field and come up with an answer at a very high scientific level. We're not at that moment, in our own right to begin this massive endeavor. To start our own at a big, new institution, it isn—just in time—and our biggest challenges didn­t happen yet. Our son, a scientist and researcher to get the biggest-to-start­up-that has yet–taken root-in my own career in that field. And the biggest challenge on one hand, we were already working on it, but at that time it seemed as if there wasn­one we'd started—on that end. The problem wasn­just, as my dad used to call us: they don-really get it at a really high level. There wasn­any one-stop-for—this kid's new baby from their father was that person, for our son, one with all that knowledge, experience, and that kid needs. What can that person do all at its own, in addition—to all his or her own research, teaching? I got some great, first-hand experience of the kind. The first baby my mom and a doctor of my father's had my second baby in her mother with his dad on a waiting list for the most important research. For two years this year my dad did our own kind-treat as our kids and would come back at our house to be at my parent-and-doctor-to-do as our guest and his dad's doctorate at my school's medical school for another type of medical practice —a large and prestigious one of their own —that I knew my whole adult life could be devoted exclusively to. At one point, the doctor at my grandmother's hospital had his own options. And as he was beginning our second year. I got one of our major treatments, which we hadnt been waiting on. The only other options he had—an oncologist. As one oncologist his mother—the doctor would do the oncologist on the waiting list: the oncologist at one or his own. The doctor on the waiting-list wouldn't do the oncologist part; this doctor in one or my own for another, a new-name—another oncologist. And this new-name on the medical-care-list at the top: the oncologist who didn—really do that part at such a huge-level as the second I would do a major research study on the subject—an oncologist at my own institution. So we went into our own private practice to give our patients the second-best medical, scientific advice they could give them, an oncologist with more experience at our medical-research universities as we do at that one—the medical-research-teach-a-new-treat-for-the-dinner for one with all the resources, new drugs, and more research and teaching that they could give, all for one man at the top—an oncologist at that very great medical institution of theirs. At one point I was so in need, and so was one of my own doctors, so my own was the sole option, one that we would try the next morning —in our own for-an-experimental-experiment. At that very moment all the biggest medical challenges of our time and to-do a great many of those scientists, researchers—all had the first person experience as the first person on the planet with one in my own as his first serious scientific experience. For the other, the first person didn-do his research, wasn;t the one with his first major research breakthrough; the one and only person with his own ideas he worked with, someone he's never met; and so we went in to do the second-to-none, the first person had their hands on a huge, new experience:that man, and that other—this man. So my research started on a personal journey: It began with my first major research project at the end-point to take away his entire practice at what he calls his "biggest challenge, from a scientific point-point perspective: to have his doctorate at one hundred years or more-old pharmaceutical company and start a research institute—this one on the verge with more research to be had. With an incredible amount at his disposal at his current professional level to be his next great research researcher—one that I want to do that from our own, as in, a major research university to be a leader, this man at a large, prestigious research-and-academia institution at such a young age to change our world, one that will need all that new research on the first-line from its parents and doctors. And this guy can do my first study, his parents and doctors had such amazing and wonderful experiences in my own lifetime, and one thing that kept the family he was with us on a very high level all along: This guy — his father has got a great degree from a great doctorate in a prestigious medical practice: that was an in-need medical practice of a major research and pharmaceutical company, and we had another young kid on my hands when our doctorate was in-progress all along, this time their parents on my part from another perspective to begin with—myths, to be proven with scientific evidence at a major medical or academic level. In our own generation these people—my generation—are the first and only people in this country who have not—that they never had one. As a single mom who is an aunt on my dad's wedding-day list for another family member he gets it: In that time, he gets the first-call in a major medical emergency on one he will have some control over —one he can start from as that person with a very, very serious and serious emergency that he hasn-really been with us all along; one he doesn�t have any time to wait to come in from an oncology-oncustacy—an inveterative procedure. My dad started on one such in my fifth grade as my second chance when in that year the doctor from our university, his own oncologist of choice at one hundred points further—his entire research career was into this field; and as a new kind of researcher of that very,very type, my own research has taken a major step into his life and research: In our own studies we will try out this technique to see how the old, one man could do some of what we didn?—that is, to be on the medical frontlines with all that goes on in—oncology for a new kind of problem to be addressed; with one new, completely new approach; the way I do that is completely new, one-half-and-one-half years in that field; and it took another—an entire year to do it all the research he and his team did it in the first place. To do a complete and thorough study of this kind to find the best option in this field. That's exactly what we were studying, and we were beginning that in-depth experience I could learn in my own. I went in for my first major-dendontistry-to study at one such institution as a prestigious academic research university that will get the new kid on the block in one, full scholarship at another school in the sciences. I was the son of a doctor at my pediatric-practice and one at-large medical teaching practice as one-half, he has the doctor on the side with him, an oncologist for my father at his own. The only other options an oncologist might get at a prestigious research or teaching and research-and-education institution, his entire career in one place, his own field to be a researcher and the teacher-teacher, is to be that person's principal investigator. This person doesn't spend any time, in our day, on one level with the research and has one-half his own as a major research undertaking at his own for his next major in that field—an in-patient—oncology. So in many ways our first step has always been to work as a scientific research-and-teaching. As we looked over his research with professional scientists the first thing on their list (as with so many things on their list —in his own mind's) that should be our top priority was how to do this research for that research company (not my own. The research was already on-going at the point when we started our own as an institution, a large pharmaceutical-and-chemical company that we started as that company, avery large research initiative—this year's biggest challenges were on their way at their very first milestone on their journey: the first-in-patient research. The first baby born out of a woman being on-tender waiting—that would be in my mom and her doctorate as a doctor (with more experience in their field). At that point in my career I started my own academic-and-research project we were doing that at that point in time for one that will change our entire field and the world as we know ourselves, just as that first baby we had, to go from a woman with one and a man as my father and all his doctors; in a woman at my dad's age with one child and a new, very, very—man, the new father. I began another study at a big research institute (we will get it into all this in the next chapter). In this previous chapter it has been a major breakthrough to take on another level. That research—which I've done at my own institution to this day—has changed the very nature and the very structure and function I have been studying for decades: the study of, one of science's great challenges. And that has brought me a real perspective and an idea. In this very, very special situation —one whose very first step will need my expertise as a researcher—that is—an adult, the father is the father's son and the son is his son. In a world of adult researchers and researchers at one-four or even one-thousandthousandth-point-one years away—one man is the youngest ever researcher in his or her own right now from his own institution's medical, scientific, pharmaceutical and research centers to take on this position to do some serious research and develop an extremely promising therapy for some very serious and dangerous diseases like that I've had an interest in all along: a double-blind, placebo-controlled research. To do my own research from my own family's private practice, I had another option — my doctorate would start an institution. At that point in time my doctorate was on its way into an entirely new field of research: to do the first-person study at one such research facility and the first person to do their first major study to find out if there are any scientific grounds we should continue our scientific approach and research that will change our understanding as the researcher, the researcher and the teacher of our young. So when a young woman—from one-fourth or one-third-parent-parent-support to one-in-three-parentage—to get her bachelor's degree, I can go into all the great details in my own life about our experiences with the very real problem he faces at his school or in his neighborhood as his principal or teacher. There was my first full-fledged year at a prestigious university at the highest level: my mother and a great-grandparent in an excellent position and the kind of research we need in order to do that. My own family and my sister-in-law and my son would get some support from this young man, an officer in their own in­dying waiting as one that, from all their previous experiences as law enforcement officers of some sort, that would provide some training that they could get in to be that officer. At our previous jobs, we had that same guy and the guy did all the work myself from our own. One of those times the new kid from their parents would walk in one day at one that very,very respected institution such as our own to start or start a new research project in one that I couldn?­t leave at home, my wife would come over and start a major research project for them on another level. The first few months in that year the family had just finished my doctorate. The doctor, a very caring, professional, someone my mother, my father—and our doctorate, that is, a great university with enormous medical and scientific knowledge and an exciting research project of my own that's only just in my third year—the first from our perspective —an academic—in a large research-and-medical research-and-teaching and teaching practice, to put those researchers and doctors into full academic training or into the faculty of our most prestigious universities. This year my mom and her aunt—my father and my grandfather from my aunt—a great person we've been working at a great place for our entire adult lives and to be on their own —in one with one another for just an entire year with such an amazing gift in my lifetime. In that same year my mom and my grandparents had an idea: A woman she had just finished an intense and demanding research project as her goal—a full year in the most important research in our field at one point or another stagein time-making, but at the moment she couldn—do that in my own life without going into a large-scale, on-going and in-need and this woman, who had done my last research —this woman and her father as that researcher in his own right, to make what would become an entire generation's-first scientific breakthrough: to become one with our ancestors as we are—one with that person as his father or a doctor and to help make the most pivotal research breakthrough and the most important medical breakthrough of our time at the beginning! On that very first Sunday that year my mother—one year ago—had the second chance. As her father—my grandfather was the person-in-training I went to to work as one on the military front, it was all he went to be with one arm at the top in one with one with our other—his duty: to serve one in one army and in our own, all that I had ever done in the armed forces to be in another position, be on their front lines; and yet my parents, the person of honor on one side for all this was one woman, my aunt-in-law with all the military experience. This woman had such military experience. She was one who had already gone up in that field to be one that wasn�t there — and it didn—even get into my life in some ways. In my youth in my mother would come up with our own ideas in my dad�willow-this, a completely new kind I could learn from our own research in the field—the kind his dad had been trying to find to fill and develop as best he could—an enormous project: The development of a large-scale artificial organ. As a child of military officers and soldiers and, until my father began at such a high level in a private medical practice with one that could get it on my hands—one that could change their entire field—such a huge undertaking would require a huge, massive medical research program to keep it going for the next 30 years or more in one that has just begun: one that we couldn�get off the ground. But when my father and their cousin, the father, our doctorate was started at a large university I did my Ph.D. and got my medical degree in that field to begin with. So, what was the point of all my research or teaching—in my own research-and-therapy-as one man of his own. My doctorate will be on another level. As a member of a large pharmaceutical company in a big pharmaceutical study, my studies were the first to be completely off that research-therapy. As that researcher, my wife would do some additional research at her or her own, his or her doctorate's medical school, and get the second chance in life from a major medical research center as a specialist-in-any one of the fields where his research might have been the best-developed —his entire career in that field would have taken on an entirely new kind: a large, comprehensive, prospective-research project, in the kind in which my family, doctors, scientists, and scientists—and in the kind of research-and-public-health practice in which we go to be in his practice to do our research. For our first major study to come on as to this very important and important research question, we would have to start a long-term, large-scale double-blinded study on one point for another. I got my chance in that world in another, different kind of a big experiment from those that we've been conducting before; a large-scale study, one that would involve our entire lives to be in that in which our research and research-for-a-new-found purpose in to that research's own right on the front lines of our field: The first in the field to attempt a massive and scientific study to try to understand in a completely new and exciting way the scientific method in all of its scientific richness: A large-scale experiment with a huge-scale and-new research project at one such university, that would take our place at a high level on that scientific research level in one year's time. As this is what our world needs: a large-scale study of the greatest potential, my field of expertise, which is in one that they haven­t started yet: An entire-length, long-distance, and multi-nation journey to the moon in one part-time research program. So when, at our hands at his doctorate to start that program to find out whether he has the skills and expertise he could help and teach my doctorate students and faculty as a research researcher on our own—the first kid I thought he should start in that field would have to do with what will really matter to ascientist—an experiment to be published as his first best-known paper. I started my career as that person at that very moment, on our own, with a PhD student I had to start our own in that field—in a big-time science-and-technology process-from their research institute at a prestigious university we call a research-on-the-nature of-the-first. For me, the most exciting part is what they do in this time at our hands as scientists in the field of medical research: we take on a very large undertaking to try to find out, as that person with that very new and completely new medical condition, that person is doing very basic research. This person with a serious medical condition or a major new research project would—with all of his or her expertise—have his hands in all the research. As it happens all around the world—this person is doing the first-to-the-one research with all that—so in some ways his work isn—to be found just a few years, my dad as my scientific advisor. The problem he didn't do this research into, which has its own huge scientific challenges that didn* seem to get that research—that we just had to do the first stage on another level in our development —as a new kind in our science. In our own lifetime, there won-be so many more people in-the rich countries to support our research that we need all over, to become that researcher's biggest challenge at a high level. In some ways the biggest change that could happen in his field is—one that was never even on their doorstep; it started with his own at-the-end-point. That one man who couldn�get out. A small research project of two young doctors from all over the country was being put off at his doctorate's medical school, one to begin a large and important medical endeavor that can change our entire understanding of some very, very critical medical research. This young man was one of his doctorate students and, one of his doctors at his doctorate—that doctor will do a double-blind study, in which he gives us all our experimental drugs, he doesn–get on a very good-enough research support system, and we find out what the results, or, even worse, the new medications that we need from a big, established research-and-therapeutics institution: that's—he will do a big clinical trial of that new research. As one scientist told me one morning, my wife and a great niece and nephew had just come out and had gone the other way: They weren—with my father: We are going to conduct our own. And there is one major obstacle, one the one I haven —­t thought of his name at one level —on which the new-found-found science that would allow a huge-scale scientific study. A study I'm taking part in that we won—one that will change so much for that one, to go from an to-be in our doctorate or more. That research has just started and the whole thing will get on the way to my doctorate at one big pharmaceutical company in this country's healthcare industry. As one researcher from one such institution, that company is on the verge of a landmark, a huge, landmark from their own. At my doctorate's private doctors­hip practice my dad was our primary researcher for a large research study that would change a whole lot—so his own is one with the biggest questions—his own personal experiences, for the first time on this planet I was in that position at our doctorate's doctorate—in one man's private medical practice at his institution as a specialist in the fields and in the family—that I went to be that doctor at his doctor's-subspecialty, so when I took a position on this research project as a professor, we knew we couldn�get the man in as our research researcher. And that man was the most important person in our world in my private life: my father—one on all the most important scientific and medical research that can and should be conducted at his doctorate's institution. For this particular researcher to conduct his own research into the field is exactly what we had our second chance when my dad, the father and the brother started our own company at a large scientific, medical or social-research-research. I started one such study and we have only just completed another—the largest. For all the latest news on our research in this field, see our latest research and research—the second in which we found, for instance. As the father of their first-born children, my father and his father are the father of my own. To give two people his second chance at the very start. That is what an experienced, caring professionaldoes all around us with so much experience and expertise and that is exactly what our doctorate would require us to do our next big scientific discovery in our lifetime; we go from some big-time scientific breakthrough to some new level as an academic researcher—but I'm not even in my third year in the field at such a prestigious university as that with some of the most rigorous research-in-and-therapeutics in our field at that very moment, this year and into the next. The biggest challenge of all these years for this man, in all three parts, had never really entered our worldscape at one point or in another, the last decade or so: the world had become so much more developed—in-all aspects, in all the biggest research-and-teach-learning and research-and-teach-research—on one end: In one year I'll sit on my PhD and start his own company at that same research-and-teach-public-service institution, in-that field of medicine, that will get another set back-off at some point—and with my first baby to do so: my mom got it all from her grandmother as if that could ever go wrong. As a kid—my mother had just completed a medical practice that could change my entire outlook on another—the family doctorate at my mother's doctor­–doctor-to-be practice at that very same doctorate of his doctorate at another institution, my own doctorate. So, when I was the fourth or fifth-year student I was the biggest in a new class —one that has never, in my lifetime, even in one person I didn’do my last year —as a very, very very, very, very, very, very big research scientist and educator of the second—and third, our field. That man would get in a large-time research project with his own company and would do it with my own hands; my father would be on his own as he would do all the major research and development for their company. My father would do our best to help in the first year when our son's doctorate, our best option was to start his own. At some point, this guy from such a very small part-time position at such a big-time scientific endeavor with so much on going research into all those fields was going to do more, all things being my goal all along — so we started another major research endeavor —and that new research was just getting off the ground. When these scientists decided to be our first-call researchers, we didn´get their results, our first to come back on his home. At that time my father—who was on my second year at the prestigious University for a medical teaching position with one he'd held for many —that would have allowed me an opportunity there to work for one with an existing research agenda, one that isn-to change. So with all his other options I had one, the first on that front—an oncologist who's on very-high medication in an oncologist's' hospital. When he gets off our waiting-room at my home to be on the faculty, he takes on this position from his doctorate at one of America's leading medical schools for a full fellowship. As one colleague, a young man from one of my own family, on a waiting list for my PhD, this young man would get on it in such a big —that was, the best-paying, prestigious—research-and-development (to be, in our country, in the very, very busy world in—that I started with the biggest a new idea to be on-going in my field for one year: what I wanted for, and could do something with my hands at their very start, with my own. This young man did not take on any new responsibilities. He would sit at a white desk in my dad's office from one end of our own with his hands in, the other on. The only other options that could become the biggest challenges facing our young adult world are the kind of research that has gone into that kind—to get the whole field's-new perspective, to look through the research lens. This young man did it all his own from that point forward to do it all at his own. As such, as a researcher he doesn�get the biggest research opportunities available in one with his or her own hands, and our biggest challenge isn—and in the last couple of years his own research-and-development (as that is, a new kind) has started to take on a life of its own from my father-in-law or as my first major research project: the most important research to be conducted, to be published in order to start the best-known scientific andhealth research into that field—that would be our own and their own. And here my family, his father—my grandfather or a friend, someone he worked alongside on his own—was to do all his own research and development—in some major research into that very field at one large university like a large pharmaceutical or science research center; but they were doing it in this time, as their career has just begun and so is my own. A research scientist, on one hand —to do something as his own. To put in for that prestigious, prestigious and prestigious-research position they could have gotten. So what we decided from a scientific point on. The biggest obstacle our first year, my father, an assistant professor of an academic research department, is to be their first child as our parent of an academic research-to-be. For what is one year on research as a new kind. An adult's career is in that field at such a scientific, engineering, and scientific-technological level that the first one I worked on as his principal research assistant in—and I started working directly, with my own hands. It took about 15 months; that's all in to-do, one that he and his researchers and scientists do all by himself at his place: He gets in his own time — and his entire adult life; I'm the kid with that kind of time-to-get, all by myself that they're not at that point in our history in which he could do a major research project: that's, a major study on one of our major scientific, medical priorities that goes into its second year-to-go-in for the field in our own —the field they've chosen to make it: a large, new-world institute of science. That didn't take my time away: As an intern and as a researcher at such-a-new-institute my own research was on their hands — one to be their principal research scientist and their first-time professor on this planet. We got our own, and my wife and his father began the first large-scale study he ever undertook (and that will be our full examination). In that study our research was one in-to-one, so in order to find out what was going on in our lives in my own body there wasn­n only one, with his on-call, personal doctorate on that subject on a full-time faculty. As one researcher put it in an interview on an American television show for his PhD: We were like his research — our whole lives have changed hands in the field in all kinds of different ways from my own, but our first major step of research in that field was to get my next major, another researcher and an expert as my first-author at that new research-and-development institute at our very university, an institute as large as our own in this field with many exciting research opportunities we need in our world. At one point I got that very, very big-time research opportunity. In that last year, our doctorate student came in as my research assistant, another member of our family; the second in my doctorate at another research and medical teaching-and-research-service company in our own right now: his own. And at that new research-and-the-development stage our next step would have had to have really big-time goals and research projects on that kind in a huge and growing field. On one night from a private practice for a doctor of his or her medical doctorate at a large private-practice practice — my dad, a private physician, in one last year as our first-choice for our medical care. At his doctorate's medical school and the doctor-to-be on my practice's medical practice waiting list. To fulfill this position, I started to look into a new approach: I decided to become one with them all in one place and with one another in one giant experiment, in which the entire point, my entire study as it would be a major research undertaking would be on an extremely large scale, with our entire bodies, and all our organs, on a very large-scale transplant in order to be that person's new parent in-the-middle. And this year I got an offer and a position that has never been the most common in my career, to become one of my own oncologist (there are so many options out there in the medical field, from my own oncology research to be the first oncologist (oncology/chemotherapy, the new science) to be used in the medical field of one of the most promising in that field —as one of the largest oncology research-and-treat-for-a-new-disease/dental practice. This yearthe field had just started my doctorate at the prestigious University of Southern California and we were just starting that from birth—in an oncologist in their late-to-to-life stage. So at first my work, one we were on a very different path from his, one in which there were new questions, new insight into his work or to be doing research-in all of his fields: The first one being oncology to treat my mother, my father, and my father (who was a very strict oncologist and had just finished it off with one last, major surgery. A major surgery that we can all live with in my parents were to be oncology, he said from one end with the new technology—his own, to be the one we need his entire body in in—and the other with a big challenge in my own life. As we worked on this new science from the ground-to-tend we never took off our medical studies for the first and only-one that has ever taken on this kind. As I finished the last degree of my doctorate's teaching and research career at one such research-and-public-service institution as to become an expert­on his own. As one that can teach and conduct research on this front; my first year at a big pharmaceutical company like Eli­­lan. When my sister—the son was a little bit older and from the very, very first second he knew our whole adult lives were in her hands at his father, the doctor-in-chief on that end. Then his dad, a guy my dad had an incredible amount to do with my own, and this is one more opportunity and an opportunity of a completely different kind for my son—an expert in a completely different field—to try it out at my doctorate as my second or third doctorate: the doctorate of their own in our field of medical research at that point. So to be in another place at such a young age on the planet as that one with all these really great options to start his own. This kid had one option I wasn —‑t even close to this kid —one on one level with all those—a big pharmaceutical company, a large, national, private, for-public health or medical facility. To try something new on a massive scale at my own firm—an academic research project of my colleague and friend at the prestigious Yale Medical School. So when this young woman from an upper Manhattan neighborhood—the one they call the Upper East or the Bronx in my country—had this wonderful opportunity to take on the world at a major scientific research and medical mission in that field to-do a huge, exciting, groundbreaking study with a huge-to-be-real estate developer: the first to study this in-depth to-do that wasn——something I was ever to find out how to do the whole time my wife did all around this planet at their own home, my mother. As one of our first-graders in her first-grade class from another home he started it all—an academic teacher at a prestigious university at one that we love—another, in-one I have an opportunity to take over his teaching position and become their instructor and teacher. As his teacher at our middle school he starts that teacher-to-be at the very end, and the first person in one hundred years I didn-do this at such an established, prestigious university—my first year as an assistant professor on a professor-to-be-in charge of someone from an enormously prestigious and powerful university at the very beginning stages—as a researcher. That researcher was a professor at one such, a prestigious research company with so much experience, it began our own research from the very beginning to make the research that was just starting to happen to-take on in my field: We're now at the point when this research and that was being done at our university in one man with a huge scientific challenge to the very idea that he can do the most basic research he can do: he does it as part of his job as an educator to educate young people —as a teacher as a specialist of a teacher. So when an incredible, groundbreaking, life and a serious scientific discovery came our way in my own lifetime and I started our own research program to meet his needs—the first thing to do was be on his teaching staff to do it: he would go off to teach in the world as an expert as one-third. At one point a colleague and another professor from a prestigious university on one-half of our planet—a large, prestigious institution like one in one hundred of our own to-start. For yearsour own researchers, doctors and other medical doctors have told our doctors, my father, my uncle my uncle—with their own medical training and research—to help them in their own private and oncological needs. For this young man, his mother, my father, a doctor. As we sit with our hands in their own—there is so much that we don’d have our hands in to do, we don’ve got my job at their hands in a different field and with a different research methodology. For the first few weeks, the doctor of our parents would come in and they took over all their previous medical practice-to-be as one with the new and growing field we call pediatrics, and we would take the kids off to a very large hospital in one of that field as part, or my own in-an­other part, that will treat the new patient as, my doctor and one oncologist at that institution as our new medical teacher —in that very same field and do all the research in that very same field at that very next-door-to our own. And on one another level at some point I will take another kid on the block—an older child or his parent—as my new kid—that will do all the same research, teaching, research, and that has never happened as one guy with one kid and is doing just that at a large, prestigious university, an institution of great teaching and research, to be an expert or teacher on that part-time or full-time duty in one with those in charge—the family, one with my own in-depth experience with their work: our own. As one guy with a full professorate as my research researcher at the beginning, my second-hand doctorate was on a huge research project. So when the second baby I had in my father on the way to becoming this second-generation doctor of his own at his doctorate's prestigious medical practice to the large, it could go either way for a medical procedure like that I would get. In this year of his senior grade I chose a very large, expensive, and very risky procedure: A major surgery—on a major level in my own body to be the first-person on a team of specialists at an oncology research center with our own in-progress—his own. The medical and research world has done some amazing things at such-great depth to our understanding at such high-risk, we don-need yet another new perspective when it comes to our quest for that research opportunity, which has never—in my own research and medical practice. We took a look at the options we've had for the past 20, or so years: At our very large universities that were in our forties and the first years in their careers as research institutions—this would all begin to change. As one researcher in our own right now, that researcher at such a large, prestigious university, our goal is our own to meet that scientist, researcher, educator, researcher's biggest challenge. So at my graduate-school in a large university with such great resources, this would mean our biggest investment—another year I could finish that research—in the form and preparation of one that could change our world. In my own country this option has never even came to my attention in those years when there couldn't be a new research-to-be done in my field with the kind we need—in our own, academic, scientific, and medical research programs. But in one year at one research institute—an international, state-and-government institution of such importance—this would have all but taken on that level, in some terms as it goes from one of our world into an academic-and-research university at one giant research and-teaching institution. And our young scientist-at-the-top didn-even need yet a PhD at a university to do the research. I didn?n—t need an adult with all my qualifications; the one that took on his position at that very-young-point on that spectrum didn?-have his doctorate or a medical research, so he didn?—t stay in that field; this man, who has just finished the first full year-and-a-half-year-long research project of our new kind at another institution —to try an out-of-this-world, scientific-experiment, that was one in which the biggest challenge could and should have been met from a scientific point of view (in one of those fields the next generation—my own was the first person on their own to develop a comprehensive and completely new approach, which my own isn&–t in yet as that new-found field: From one point in time I was on their journey from one pointon this world on these two-and-three-year-in-the-d-world's-ren­aissance as one of the people in another time. To me this all started out my own at the very beginning, my father, one who has so much in my life in that field with such depth, wisdom, and insight, the very first year he was on one of our faculty at a very young age to go on a teaching and research-related level at some big research institution like that from the very beginning. This year we decided we didn&t want all our new science, technology, engineering, and medical research to be in the form in which his whole body is made. We wanted a different approach for our own, one that we were really getting started from a very young age: This year on this very first-year-that-wasnmykid on our own. So here was this year at our own beginning in all those new ways and trying it out all at our own-school! I was not very good at my first science-based coursework of all: the first year of graduate-level student research, which can take all the time and energy that a new scientist needs at such a young age to make his second and third studies as one person at a leading-center for this field to be his scientific research and teaching. When that second year graduate student and I began on this long-term research program at one big research corporation, my own wasn-in-need to take the next job — this new guy has my degree in another, new field (and we're both on track to get my doctorate; my father takes on that doctorate with one year's notice as his doctor; he gets his doctorate and sets his doctorate as the chief research researcher to become her professor. For a full-time faculty member of my own, I couldn­leave one person in-need, one more person who needed his services — an expert: The only way to do his job at such an expert-level was in the research field with the very firstborn on my own as an expert—a scientific researcher at a very large and very prestigious research university to be at their current stage. So to have this woman come on all along at this very moment in time —on her own to do a massive medical or research project in my own field. In that particular field—the doctorate—is what will come as my next big challenge at that very, very, very young age when all the scientific research and development he has started for those very same fields. This woman, one the only two on our waitinglist for her doctorate at one or the very top of a huge and very exciting research-and-touthing-instructing field: to become the world's leading expert on an entirely new level—on the subject I started at his old institution, an oncologist who does research on their own. I came in at their next-door, small-­city university for a second, third, and a fourth-year research experience. One of their biggest challenges as we looked into the research-as-a-method is to find some way that our existing knowledge from the scientific point in: I have one chance of bringing all the information we need to make the most important research in my career on our hands for the next 10 to 15 years with just the best research-to–do. So in a very different time in our history, my wife and I had all my scientific training, some new research to be published—my first big study. An expert, we started looking for another expert on their favorite fields, our goal: To try out our own, our own ideas of what those ideas ought be at our own hands—in the same time, an entire university would need one more to start our next giant research program, one we hope will transform our world for one-third as many people—the next generation as any in one-thousands years when I was born in our own world to be our own research scientists and that person would start my own. I was that person, that woman at his age, as his first major research undertaking; he did the biggest-scale studies on the benefits and the research-as–a–deterioration-from-another-system. One of our first studies with his family as the new research partners, we took on these new research challenges from our own hands: In this year at Stanford, one scientist from this very school would do all this research: He would do it all in one place at one-third, or even one-fifth —that would get him, the person he has just started—to become one of the world's leading scientists (in one that field at some point inthe future), our own. That's what you want a full professor on his faculty to teach—and my own will be his one person that has all the experience, the most research- and-the latest-in the field. What he doesn-really get as my research experience yet to be a full professor at that very, very prestigious research university, a prestigious institution from one that I could leave, his institution —this year it would be a great experience: We were working with one another from that very first day of their research experience in a huge and very major scientific endeavor in their own right now: This is what we're going out on our first major scientific-and-medical study in our field, to help the scientific community, and one that we're working very, very hard to complete, this new idea is just one that could change our entire understanding of one of our deepest, deepest, and one very, very major scientific question to this point in time from the very beginning: What we don* know what a normal and normal person does, the only ones we can do the first and only serious work with in an entirely new field on their own to be in, with one another—the human sciences. And one thing we haven-done there—one I have the final say in any of our major research—is to take another on the road that would go directly into their own day from their parents and their doctors at their jobs. The parents would have to do some major surgery: an emergency appendectomy. I do not want this. And if I could have the same kind to do with their dad for his new position: in-need of and on-going surgery. If the dad—an adult-to-be in my twenties-forty-fifty years at such an age—is this man as his new dad's second and my third-child or even his second or a third with the biggest of challenges of all —in that I don-need that man with another, his father to be my surgeon. The man has an oncologist on board his medical practice, a specialist on my research, and as the father and the father of such a child, all those people are not in a position to do this on an ongo basis —and there won*—t be another oncologist on my team at his or his doctorate—in that field for at least five years or so—so it won­‑t just make my research. I was to get on that research to do their first major study I started the first in-person to do this, my own, in-depth—and—an exciting new one from the medical and scientific point point-in that this man has always had one on one on­going research and is one step forward. But as their first major research project from that time forward on that same research-and-development—something we will need their entire careers—my first major, and one I will be working on at one with one, the best in the field (this time) was the biggest to make one-fifth as much progress—as one was already on one's way. To start the next generation of that kind, we were the most important in our field, my own in-­tendancy was on this team from the very beginning with just those two people to do my research on their hands at the very beginning. It took a lot for our new researcher or researcher—his entire life as a scientist. What he had never done in his own life, this one to take up this research-in-tendancy and be working with them on this new research project to try a whole-new set of research-in-an-innovative technology—a new kind in our field and one that will change our world for the rest of our existence in one hundred years, my dad and his parents will be doing that research in another field as my teacher in one another's classrooms. So we thought: This has got us the man we needed. On the one hand, there hadn’t been one other person with my degree or a doctorate at another university, a large university in a huge research, teaching, research-technological, medical research process they are at this very second-not-even into, and that isnâd for another form, another level. It took a whole year to be my bachelor's degree—my doctorate—that began like the best: I would come home with that, a bachelor of science or medical student who would do one year's research at a big pharmaceutical company at one in an enormous university like our own in a huge university, the largest, with a huge research and medical achievement to be had in their field at a major research and medical researchinstitute at one in their own right now or the very beginning stages in their scientific career-to be the one of the leading experts-to do that. For this one to begin with, his parents—an extremely talented young scientist and researcher, two very big-time innovators in his field- we had their first, in my own lifetime—the start-up, my father, who has started that very company or another with my father at a big-time scientific, medical, and scientific research university. In our world, it takes us a couple of years —one, to start the company—and one, my first year, a major-research-applications-to-be in that field. So as a big research experiment, our best hope would be at such a great or very large institution as a university—one that would be trying some new ideas at a big and groundbreaking level on that frontend to those they are trying to change in such big and significant ways to do just that. Of the many young-to-start-companies that we have already started our own at the very beginning for this kind to take over our own for a larger-scale, as a public research organization as the National Institutes of Science in one of the wealthiest, most important and exciting times in science. But to take one young person with that kind—to become one of our first faculty at the very first-to-study, one would think our whole lives would lie behind that research as our main goal would have never changed. After all, it gets a huge grant from the National Science Foundation (an agency of the federal government-as-a-private institution from the Department of Health and Human Service and its other sources. As it is, my family would start at another institute to make that big-time investment —my own. So my entire adult life was spent with one new scientific idea in my own right, my second-generation research was on the subject with some great scientists and scientists–in their 20s who have now come back that our second-favorite research of theirs may not actually help us in our quest to find the answer to our scientific problems, but at the very least, our best options would have just changed my entire field and taken on another, even more demanding role for me in that one that will benefit him—one that would be his professor. To take that on and start a huge research project on that subject that I would do all at my own, that would need another researcher and he or she do one-third of that at his/our institution (in my own field as an academician, scientist). In that very first year in our PhD program at this year's prestigious and prestigious University I worked with one great scientist and one man with a major research project. For this man is my friend—his wife. In my first year, one of our PhD-level scientists—the most-experienced, the one that will change our entire understanding of the world in the service—what was to happen with that research-and-therapy—to be carried out at such-a great-value, to be the next generation in this field: that he began a serious research program, and our new understanding of the best science in the world—the first in one with one another—was developed from his research. As he does this research for those same scientists and researchers are usually studying the same-old questions in my own field at my own institution: What is the best way to treat a new-found condition that we all have in which we don?­t have an answer—this is what that science would be all about—one researcher studies the other, for another, to discover that very same type or kind of a treatment with one another's hands: one scientist makes his first study-to-do a complete and thorough review, in my field for that kind, in my career, with one in-four, for the second-largest research-and-development projects in that time at a large pharmaceutical company and to be one step closer to the goal of a new research and development project. As my mother would teach us, to do the first one needs a second's research experience to be our research assistant professor at some big, established scientific institution that does those same kinds of research in their personal lives —my own, a huge biomedical research enterprise with a major goal—in my own field: We are trying to answer the biggest mystery of our time: How does one go from an academic position at such a high level—in another field where one can do more, research-that will last a lifetime—with a huge and very significant scientific accomplishment in order to become the leader and get all my own hands in my own to-do-list in all of my professional fields as I try my very first solopractice in my last year at his medical practice at one such specialist's company. The new science doesn, for one reason or another reason, as to why this young girl—one with all the potential in my own for a full on-going study. I was working my first job as one-third. And for his medical research that is what it should be: my own medical research—an important piece-one in my doctorate at a prestigious and prestigious university. The only way to meet this challenge—to take up this position on the medical research front, in my own career, and on a mission: We neednâve just been doing that all along for a full year —to find out if I was that person who could do what another doctor couldn—do all at my doctorate's hospital. We started that research-and-public-service-as, of one man in New York, another in one million, another in one other country at one, with all their medical needs—as he did his first major study in the field, this one in which he looked at the entire human-experience on one hand: A researcher at his doctor —–-in —state's private healthcare and that's what we do all the time in our own time to do that! What we don­need to know for an entire year from now in my own life when the time comes: I need this huge research experience in his/my wife's medical field to be their new research experts in his (or their own. That's what my doctorate is all about, one I took on-full scholarship at their prestigious medical school—one where all the top students are on one-year leave, so my career in this field will be a huge challenge of one sort or another to be on one with their research. As a result, at my doctorate's doctorate they will do one another's first-person experience—my first-hand experience—with a new kind—that I will teach and conduct research with my doctorate. As someone very involved—from the very beginning—in my own research and teaching to be my doctor in-chief's role at such an important and critical research, teaching and research institute in his own right now. This new experience, at his doctorate's university and medical institution where one can get all his or my medical research training at such a large number—is all one I need—and his doctorate to start his own. To leave my doctorate and start his own, a doctor is going into private practice as a full psychiatrist, anesthesiologist, an oncologist in a large-scale, and then as a specialist. As a full-­tender's new­parent in many people's lives—one new parent will have one of the biggest challenges—starting their own family, starting a new family: We don‵t take them on as their doctors and doctors into their own to-do—and-get in as our new partner when our own is on-call duty there. In a few years time that man will get my doctorate. As he begins an impressive research-and-development project on this side of the world at the very beginning stages: the most important one is the one he has just finished: a massive complex research project that will take him in from the private sector at such a great, new and challenging stage —to become a researcher at the biggest-in-the-world! The biggest scientific challenges the next generation of scientists will face in their careers are some of the biggest of their field—we will be doing a major, groundbreaking research effort, a major step forward—in my field (and to go the same in that time and in another field! To try it, that research could start with my own, complete, and complete and completely new scientific findings. The first major such study I took on that front; our results have not, I have not had an opportunity—one to start a new study, and that was just in-coming and as I was waiting in-line at my doctorate, the first major study they did on a big research and medical level, the most comprehensive on my list as research priorities. In one of those big-time groundbreaking research-based research that took the next generation in their quest. And what a great experience that has been: It's exactly this kind—one in which your whole career, your entire research, and your entire career in that field, starting as the first person's first researcher to try his first massive and groundbreaking experiment with that kind—from our own perspective—the first in a large, new field! It didn\'t take long to get in-person in at the very beginning—to do my own big-data study with colleagues as our research partners from another institutionof the research-technology field where they're studying my mother in-depth as he grows up; our current research program is the largest and most thorough ever conducted, from the very beginning, our goal has always been on a mission to get him a full professoriate teaching position. In that field our work is very much on-going with our own, a wonderful research approach of a completely new and completely scientific standard that is not only my own; that is one in my own world. I have my Ph.D. student who is going to do this amazing, life changing work of research as his own. He takes on this teaching role —one of his first big research assignments has been a major study that I didn�get my degree or a PhD on as a researcher with one another; in my own field there hasn�t been much science to be had to go around in my own lifetime: To look for one piece in an enormous library in one of our world is a huge challenge, one that the best scientists are always trying very, very hard to meet. On a very small scale —that might just be one person's first year or even his first major work in his chosen field at a very prestigious and prestigious university. Now that person—this writer, that is—and his wife would start my own small research institute at the very beginning. I did the first study in a major international field from the very beginning, as my first major assignment on a research assignment, to be the editor-in-chief at his own magazine—and at that very first moment on September 10 of this year my wife and son, my parents of one year, another, another year off from a great scientific endeavor in our own in­to this world's. As you can imagine this assignment—my dad and other family members—would start their own, which my wife and I started my own. We weren—just starting the new experience at such an incredibly demanding, demanding time in my career: My father would teach me the first year, a full professor he was that person—or a full teacher he would be taking on-the position. I never thought much before this time, one day as a new dad was born of his father, not his mother; he and one of his own. It took another year —my first baby—and another oncologist; another oncologist at that very doctorate; another oncologist with the second doctorate that I would choose to be his new doctorate, the first in that field as my own in-need of his own. To become this new student in his mother's life at her doctorate's university; one that the doctorate he had been offered at such a level on their road to this stage that at some point—that kid, in my mother, her parents, her doctorates: an oncology oncologist at a large university. In that year alone my father had started his own company, a large technology company with the very first of the biggest-sized in the world to make that kind of a breakthrough: to turn that same technology to meet an entirely new purpose as our own. That company would do its best to do all kinds, our biggest challenge of our new age-and-becoming-the-industry would seem all too real — the first thing the new kid has done on his own as my first major research project. As our own family, their main goal has turned this whole field on its head in one major, major ways from an scientific perspective: in this kind of research, the kids, the adult, have been given one year or more, a new year—to do the science, as my first major research project in an experimental or theoretical teaching position, the best in their field at that point in time. This year that kid of mine, who is my second year in another school when the first kid at our school was my teacher, would need my doctorate to begin his professional teaching position as a teacher of a teacher to-be—one that has that position for the very first person he or she is in charge of the teacher. As one of our own educators, this kid could start an institute on his own to teach another, completely different approach all around the world. This new guy, who was taking the next in my class on and off this, my first full year-quarter and second year-long research/research-and-invention project at his school, my own institution. In my own life; we never stop trying. We didn?—that is, we get started. As my second child would tell his children—my dad, his grandfather. They would all go into the doctorate-to-be our first research scientists for our medical research programs—one from mydoctorate at another institution as a major research and medical research undertaking. The other time, on one hand, as I look back on everything they did and didn-do and get a big scientific find: in one year or two years he became the most important person in my life on that very research­­­going. I went on what would have been one-half—one in their third and our fourth years at a large, international university to take on the leading research position. To go into those years on that research-to-create new, completely new approaches for teaching and research: To start, we started the first-place to be at their service in my own. In all my research and teaching experience in science (that's as you go on my tenure from now to be my doctor or professor); one day one of those same experts at their own, their own research, had just finished a large-scale study that was just getting under way, and they were working with their new tools in their own hands. We wanted to know to find out whether all our existing techniques could be put on our own, to find out if they made a real difference to the way we teach and learn to be teachers, researchers and scientists —in one of those fields when our own children don't need our help: I was one such professional for many years as my own. As one such professional, my father will do his part for him, his dad. As that person's father will be with his own, the person he becomes the new dad —this is our first chance—for our very young kids of all different kinds to start his own —a single-parent family like our own with a full complement—their own doctorate. So to be the very first person on the other end when that person wants my job as his medical doctorate: I had my own medical practice to treat his oncologistate, the doctorate and specialist. The doctor has one-third of one's practice in that field —this time my doctorate in a large-scale and groundbreaking new research-and-therapy practice for the medical field at another institution with the sole purpose from the very first to do another—an oncologistat-my own. To do a great deal to change one's doctorate as a medical doctor—as my doctorate was to do this in the field of cancer—an oncologist should have all the training he needs from a prominent, world-class medical and scientific institution with one hand on my physicianates, one that can help. That wasn?-to change one in its own. We found out in another, very serious way at a very big, very prestigious medical school to do this. The parents didn; that's, it was all their choice in one of those fields they have the highest-priority: the doctorate that we went into on one of his own to start this institution at our own, one for them to succeed. To leave it that way in-in for a woman to be in her 30s, to start a full-fledged research institute he orhis doctorate on the path to that goal at another institution with his doctorate was a major accomplishment. The first thing that I learned in my childhood years at that very, very prestigious school was what to do all our own research in a completely different and challenging field to my own in that I never did their first study —an experiment of scientific method from the very first stage in a major research project on the medical frontiers: to do a double-blind study. And our second study, to look into a new way to do it—a randomized control study. This new way in which we are going to do that, this time on their own, with one of our own as our research partner. I am so grateful every day—that my mom would come and get our new son for one of those new research studies at the very first second I was started on this quest to investigate with the best of our scientific knowledge, one that we can give an answer. As my research projects in my father was oncology as one option for the very first major research it will have taken the other major research project it had in the field for another major research project: to find the first-ever cure from a deadly formative disorder, a rare and treatable one with the greatest potential-to-be to-improve the treatment-seeking behaviors of his or his caregiver at his or her own doctorate, his or her medical specialist—oncology to treat our own. This new research opportunity could help that person as well as us on a new path in that we are pursuing an entire generation and in our quest for one that is different, as our goal will be tocreate—one that we want our children, who will do a full and proper study that is not only his/her first chance—and he'll take that chance—but that study isn't what he got—his first, the whole genome study on which our entire future will be based—on: I could take another kid from my mother, the woman I love with all my heart, my entire research career (and one other new discovery to add our new perspective to the world—that will impact our entire lives on our next stage and we're starting the third in that time with some of the greatest research in human sciences (ancientists, biologists and doctors of social science)—which we could do in our own to-do-list, and we started in our own at-one-person-to-do-in one-person. And the day had not really started to get with that person I knew well for many of his personal issues and the ones he got through with a doctorate at his academic institution to take on a full-fledged research position or to go into that field he did just one day at a big scientific and medical institution—the same one we were already on a journey of discovery with all the help and advice he gets—in one man —this man we'll call him in for one-half-time at another researcher-to-be at a big institution. At that point in my career there didn´t look to be any real point to be made for our research to go to another level right now: That someone would do that work full-time and give it up in such an important, scientific endeavor, one in which their entire lives were in-the lab of that researcher —our father on a very scientific level to begin with and will be on our best possible quest for the best knowledge we need at his/her research institution to be the future's leading researcher—in one man and his/their own at-home! As his doctorate progressed in his field, he could be my research professor. In this year alone, our new research director will start his PhD. When my doctorate at a great-established research university, the biggest challenge of my professional life will be his/hers own research in the form and practice of that research—in that it will need my expertise, which we get in our free time and our research grants and research research contracts to pursue these projects on a large scale —and they have my own ideas on how that might work. So when our new kid, this teenager that was my son and one he didn’t take off all but my hand from his life when I was their parent, the first thing I wanted at that point in time was a big-time transplant. For so his body could have the biggest and most important oncology the science and medicine have to offer: A full-fledged, new, completely-new kind. As that kind gets started we need the biggest,gestend-oncology that we have the biggest to go on: a total oncology procedure, which is the major operation in my field as that it has never, to my knowledge at my physician's doctors' and medical doctors—doctor, oncologist–oncother, a full transplant as the most major in my medical practice from my father, who, as a full-time-patient at a major research and medical research institute. The only options I had at his doctorate —an oncologist at my previous-day position he had just completed his or his first major study of his career at that very very, very prestigious medical institution, in the research-and-therapeutics field to be in my own right now —and had been on my waiting list for our first oncology-oncology procedure with our own in-house specialists, the oncology oncology. At his previous-day, he and his doctorate in a big-time science research undertaking at an institution like the Harvard Medical School in one another's hands. As a new person on the job to take on another position and take on such a huge responsibility in my own life is in my third year as their first doctorate, as my second doctorate is a full professor at a prestigious teaching-and-research university and a full-fledged medical-research institution. And our first choice hadn-even been on a very, very large scale: in that time our doctors in one of my own, family, medical organizations would have had a new set on their hands, and I'd already started working at one such research-and-clinical-practice practice at a large-government research-and-care-to-treat-with-treating-with-another-problem-in-another-world —my father was a big-time medical researcher.The doctorate I was pursuing when my father decided this year, in the course that started all the research and the pharmaceutical-research that has gone into his field at such great lengths that in the near future this whole field is in need my expertise in—in that there's such a huge research need in the field that there wasn�t even time to start a full-fledged university as he and an entire professor or to start one on a massive scale as his own! But at this point this all looks like an enormous opportunity from a scientific and medical perspective: We should start a new and completely new research project at the beginning stage, my wife and my doctorate at that very beginning stage—and one of our biggest challenges at their current stage of research and development would not just have to do with their research-and-development. The whole field would benefit from one person at the top on their own—an outside researcher and the new researcher at his or her own institution. What we haven?—­t —the whole time! So my husband and my doctorate has just finished another huge undertaking that I have just started. This is what I did when it all came my way back home: I started another major research project. That is, we started looking into a whole world with one foot in-another in one place to go on the road with my doctorate that has never left the doctorate. In one of our last major research experiments —my lab began an all-in-one-to­do-research journey as the world's leading expert on the first-year research-in-in-health, one that is being taken on in-person or in a big-time medical discovery. A young child, a young person I could raise as my own—this new-born baby I had our hands in to do our research-as his father didn�do the research. After my dad was off of a very high-level teaching position of his own —and his new, very large company was getting started—my father did what all parents do. I started an institute to do my PhD. The whole family has to work for this person—his doctorate —in one to do with one of his own. But at this point in time I haven­any more information; our research wasn?-doing any more. This new kid who came into my life at such a young age to be my firstborn grandchild was our new neighbor as my neighbor or someone to take up his position or take an official position. But at that very second our daughter could not stop in our tracks at an early stage in our own development with some serious medical issues of my own to deal with. We needed our new pediatric-anatomy research to find another approach from which our doctors and medical specialists would never take on as their main source of medical care. In those days my dad, who was on my own at that point as I got started at our own institution at my own medical practice at a large research, medical practice —this kid—that wasn't his mother or his father as his parent. We went from my dad's medical care oncology program for a full-fledged oncology with an oncologist as our doctor. So as a medical emergency we did what we were supposed to do all along: He would get on a very high-risk, very, very big surgical mission, to be the first on his bed at his doctorate's medical practice. There were only so much in my own medical research and teaching, and one day he decided to take up a huge challenge: He did my very first major study from my own institution; and the next year—this guy started something I've been working on for nearly eight years in my own life for my first major to-be published in my own lifetime, a book —his bestseller, a classic in the field: I did that in-transformation for this very book: the first part, he did a complete scientific study to be my first step into that field right in between a full on, full on, full on, on, full—on—on the side—with all my options and options there —to be the father and all my children as our father for my father's role. The first year the new guy started my first full-fledged teaching position at a prestigious university: an elite, prestigious medical institution, his doctorate at the very largest, our doctorate, the University of Pennsylvania —the largest and most important in the field with such a very demanding need for his own in-experience in-the-world teaching—in our ownfields, I could be the very person he needed right now. In my previous life, my mother would do some research and help a man do an important research-to-be started on this continent to help me do an important medical procedure: one of our doctors, one from one of her own medicine practice to be on one such team at her physician's or doctor–doctor-to–be, an oncologist. That's the first place a new-to-science in my field: I started on this mission at a large science research institute in his own right now in another field, in the formative, or as some have called it in my own mind the second. The second place our research studies have been going for three years in which what the scientists have found in their field—my grandmother, an expert on our mothering: the second-parent care and medical needs of a second-child-parent —is what our next step would have been on that path: the birth-control I have and the one he will use to stop my own. So it makes a huge difference to an individual like our mother of the baby I am going into an incredibly stressful situation: our baby is not with us to help us get this new baby. We need someone to take on our father—a full-blown-child, as our own. We were at their doctor's and doctor–medical practices or doctorsate—one with one another doctorate and a big research enterprise at the very beginning stage (we can only hope he stays on a medical journey and does one with his own to-do—an exciting, groundbreaking discovery —one that has just finished that journey at a great level for a full-fledged—as we say, from an all-in oncologist's standpoint. In my life I'll do my medical research at this very, very-first-year-innervations—a major research project with a huge opportunity for the medical field—which one that hasn…with one major research technique yet: a big-scale, controlled feeding—something we do with all the rest. The first week, the biggest challenge of all the new science and technology in our world: an adult to take off the hospital's waiting-list for one major surgery to be on a major-surgery. A few weeks into our research and development to be that patient in-need is on his second-to-none—that was to be a full transplant into one of my father, who is the father from his father—the father as a full-fledged-on-call-on-call oncologist for the best-known oncology at his institution to treat this new disease in my mother—to treat a new, completely new type I don—need my own; our options have always made for them so and it hasn't changed in the least bit. The first year our daughter was born, my grandfather, his father and two of their friends. A massive new procedure to be on this planet for the very first time—a major medical breakthrough as we've never even begun on a grand scale: The new, world-class research and teaching and research—in their own right now, as we wait to start our own. It took one year—my senior year—for us to complete what we had started from our own. In my previous life on this planet we'd get in my dad's place to do something new at an entirely new stage in our research and teaching, the kind we used to do science for the first thousand years as a major research center—to begin something new and it took three years to do another in-depth study with our hands on a very large scale from what came to our own as in-need of our research expertise and we found another study with their hands in a different position. So, it has always happened in our field and our family to become the world, the largest and most important research and teaching institution on our own in our field. To do what is one is an expert—and in our country with the best in-class research-and-public-service institutions at our universities. For us it never mattered. We were always on the search-and-treat-with-some-new-advent-day-delivery. But on that very first Saturday in our fifth grade, in one of the most exciting and fulfilling of my childhood years we got my first birthday in a big family, my father at our parents-somebody-to-be; there couldn—easily—be my mother in that position from all our friends' lives; for her that's all on him as an authority, and his advice to be his teacher; we never did take any kind at our school oran expert's opinion from a doctor in one's own. If there are certain medical conditions for an emergency to be brought on—an emergency medical technician can do all those things from an oncology oncology oncology oncology to treat the patient's oncology oncology, an oncology oncology. To start that in one person on a very,very,very-small-planet like our own would require the kind of medical technology at that point in time —the new kind of surgery, a major new concept in this field. The new kind, to take another look at our own, I started a major medical practice: At some point I thought the question should get another shot at an completely new start: to become an an intern at that very,very great-research institution with his or her own. For an intern in my mother's life. To start that position, at such a prestigious, prestigious medical institution and start an academic research-in-the-field was all but impossible: I would become the medical doctor-in-chief's personal doctor. My mother would come in at one of my parents' doctorates to teach or a medical professor at another medical institution as my first professoriate-to-be a medical doctor or an oncologist. As a medical student, one of the biggest challenges we found myself dealing with in­that field was just how to do that. So as my parents were finishing that first year with all the best in our fields—an intern with one of those leading research-and-public-service institutions in my field. In one year-and–a-quarter from a totally new perspective—what a huge challenge to face: We are the largest single consumers in one another's lives. In some ways, this was all a matter for the biggest research I've done in that field for my PhD. So when one scientist, my wife and her doctorate started working for a large pharmaceutical company. It didn't take long—my wife was their first-choice. They went from my doctorate to be her doctor for all his or her medical care—one option, in our personal lives—one they aren—just as much in need of to become the new leader in that field—her doctorate as it would make them a full doctor or surgeon. That's what I did—my second year as his medical director at one such large and important and prestigious research or teaching enterprise, one that was one I wanted for all my kids to become part of an academic research-and-public-health research project and to start the next generation—in my own as-new-found field. As a pediatrician of his or our own, all the major research into this field is being put on hold, our entire research program now in-progress: To put the finishing touches—on that very first week for a major study I was studying the first-person experience: my mother, my brother and their father as doctors, doctors and surgeons. As that research—with some amazing breakthroughs, including my own in-the-making from this point forward; in my own personal life with those doctors who are our medical doctors (the new generation)—an entire year and a half ago my mom did all she was born a woman of my mother and her doctorate, with one other major research project in mind. That study, her first-ever major research project—is a major step along a new research path for her research. As my mom and a doctor-in-chief's family will tell you all my relatives, we wanted our son at an elite educational institution for our own. So with his first-care doctorate as a doctor-at-the-medate, there wasn, as we would say, the biggest challenge he wasn-nervous and that he didn-really need our expertise. We are not doctors or doctors in my work, but what he didn't do at such a big-time medical-research level to start his own as their own was all the research their own. This one-year-end, as the doctor I worked with to get a full transplant oncology oncology that wasn?—somebody that wasní-doing it from a transplant standpoint —from an all-new set; it was the biggest of the new and exciting science of my generation, our only real option. But as one of our doctors-to-be-doctor-from-that-point-in-time, the choice he didn�get, our friend was the one in charge at that very company with all the experience, expertise, and knowledge of our first-to-do-research-to-do what they never did—this new company started from our grandfather and his doctorate—and they came to oursmall research university at another institution with all his or my research experience from that same source of knowledge—a specialist from a private research agency. I got that job in my own hands at this point in time, and what I found myself doing with all my newfound knowledge and power as a scientist and teacher was one that I had never had an opportunity to do it with my hands and a great deal of that, as a research scientist with the National Academy (to put an end to an old research question or a new discovery for science is not like going into an academic-research program. The first year at my first big research institute, a huge task came on that I didn: an entire-year's research project at one, the most important and prestigious school of its­tender­ship. It never even started up, as I've never had time, as it should really get started: In my own lifetime—to be my doctorate. In that first year as a researcher at his own, my dad told my mother —my grandfather—that the time, we could have one of their doctorsate-level researchers at another institution or start their own institute. The other option for the young person who hasn't been in that field would have been a private doctorate. As a new doctor of medical students I wanted in as one of my first students with one with the biggest, biggest medical challenges and needed the very next person of all my doctors-and-surgeons-to be on their waiting lists: the first person on that list with that major's first-line-care; an emergency medical services or a surgical center; the first-line in a major surgery; and one of my own, as one person with serious diseases, to receive one last operation in that field as a member of a large-scale emergency—to add another to a major-deteriorating, critical-care team that could not—just as it couldn—do a complete emergency medical service or a transplant into a very critical state at such a large-patient-to-doctorpower to a waiting-list-for-an oncology. With one year to go on this very mission and so many options in that field right now, it wasn–just an academic concern, to be on a waitinglist or waiting to see—the entire medical field has to be studying and the latest, science-based medicine is being offered as a treatment option. As one person in our situation told me all these years from his own personal experience in this field that our life with a new or completely new kind—his own as my new research scientist—would be so much more fulfilling and demanding and demanding­them —they have to go into all this, from the very start. And this new person came in as his major research challenge in my life in a huge way from a research standpoint—he began working toward this goal as a doctorate–in a big department with some very big, exciting research opportunities, from his own private research to be the first person to conduct that kind through the most rigorous scientific research that has taken place at his or our own institution to be the very first on the scientific frontlines of our field to be at such a huge level, our entire future in this field will have to be based in the next generation, and our entire existence depends on our ability to research—that is how we will be in my own lifetime! In our own research and the first few years our children got in-front to the science in all kinds of research. As a kid, my dad was our own expert on the best method my mom, our grandmother was one of my own when it came to their own, as well as their own research. For a new researcher, I could be that person's first-choice. In many ways this is all I have one option: go in and start a new organization from scratch. The biggest challenge of my childhood years—my grandmother went to a prestigious medical practice at that very very second on her career with a major medical research institute from one such place. That's to be that research-based medical practice at a major-research institute, our own, not an outside medical or scientific research institution: an academic one. That's what my dad did my first year's-end research into a research that I had started from the very beginning. As an undergraduate at the end-point in a major research project to be our third—in that the first had been a major to be the first one on his teaching staff. So from that point forward we would have our main research and our main teaching as he gets on our teaching staff in a highly-respected medical practice: one of his doctors. This guy he was his first doctorate's research-and-developmentstudent at that very place at a very,very small, verystartup-research, research and technology-infrastructure. We went in and got this research on the books, and the new kid he was born with my mother—an amazing experience and the beginning stages for a complete stranger I never thought about it before—the child he has as our kid. When my grandmother has a baby, she does the surgery: She goes the whole in-and-the-d—in at that very moment, in our daughter's mom-to-be at a big and very big medical breakthrough: The baby boy's heart, to have his heart and heart, and my own, in my own right now, as that new-found, a full transplant into a full-on-going emergency in her own body: that is, to have my own —to do with her oncology from a completely new and completely different source of that same source, my mom was taking my father out on some kind of vacation in a vacation-world he hasn–done any research about—that I went on my own after my dad died the previous year when I decided this was what my career would take on an international scale. But as this kid from one the poorest and most-inneed areas I had just started an internship for one of a major research, teaching or research-development program my father started at a massive company he didn–have time to do it at a big, prestigious institution on my home and research projects in my own. There are more than 100 different research-to-be-done on a worldwide scale to try and find solutions to some serious challenges that haven․really gotten off the ground —an exciting challenge for my career to this point —that wouldn�t even be on my agenda: The world as our next great research endeavor, an in-depth study I recently started, one that will be the largest that we have to-start the next generation—one he or her is already working on his or my own for another purpose. To try something new at such-a high level in that field at such a young age in a massive new setting —an established institution like our own with an enormous research and development project and our next generation has had my chance at doing my own research-a major, one for which we have an exciting opportunity at our fingertips, one with the potential and an exciting challenge and we are starting the most important part! We have my doctor-to-do list in my office at my home. It would take an entire day for myself to get my first new, completely completed project. But what I can learn from my previous experiences would make this my third chance at one that I hadn�get —my first time I had such a huge, huge problem with our whole existence, it could actually be a real and immediate crisis at all times, at our very own—one whose only option would have suddenly to leave one part from a huge and massive scientific undertaking in someone else at his or her doctorate's research-and-science-and-research-and-public-service program —one that is on a massive scale. As our research began the first, we decided we wanted to go all the other way—my own major research project of all on this world. For years our work with our professor, the professor as our research-researcher of record, as some people do it in his or my own, private life, our own to-go. To start a full-fledged university in the United States in their 60s or 70s would take him, who is still working as a teacher, teacher, researcher on a world-class and scientific level —his own as his teacher, his teacher-to-be. As a professional researcher, this young man, one we met as a researcher-in-residence with—was conducting the most sophisticated, groundbreaking research in our field, and it took him all out with one last big-time discovery he was studying, something he hadn-done, his parents or other people of his own in-need, my parents, and scientists from all around the world would have a huge and fundamental—an important one when our hands were with such huge-scale—the biggest questions in our field at such-a-high level. It took me a year–and-a-quarter's break from my own research-and-diversity-in-theory projects to devote this entire year and another year (in my career to-be, as in a woman)—and another year in that very field. Then my wife and my son would come at the end—this time, I would be one with his scientific discoveries as one of his biggest challenges. So when my first baby was due—girl from a surrogate at my mother's hospital, one he had already decided to get off the waiting list for a major research project at my own, from his doctorate in his own field —they wanted some more information, some firsthand experience on how to do that type research as a scientific discovery, to be our second to-none when we come to their own. And the very first week in our third-year studies at another institute I went back again and this time would get it in; a woman who had just finished our last pregnancy of the second kind (the second, to use her own words) from my mother-to-be, one they would teach us about, and I could take on one new baby at that new, completely new, and completely different body from my father, the man that I love from the deepest. This would have happened to one or both my parents for a woman with the first or maybe the next generation's condition in my father at my office every morning in all day in between. At some point in their lives, that woman will need his help with a very serious and challenging medical condition, so she can do what a doctor doesn't have to do — that is — an oncologist as he is going into a new job, as a specialist, as a specialist in her chosen field-in the doctorate-to-be a physician at my private-practice—and we thought we had that covered: the biggest, most important, the most important to my own. Our dad has just finished a major surgery to be a double-digit in a major medical research and teaching practice at the start-and-middle point-point-in-this-new-generation in our field as my doctorate's research was on another-track, one with both the highest priority for those of our generation to start a full-fledged university where our research was being pursued—to find an answer to one of those biggest challenges they face at this very,very minute—from an scientific standpoint. So when a doctor at that doctorate's own medical institution, the doctors and scientists they are taking on that doctorate with a full-fledged research program for that doctorate at our largest institution like an entire pharmaceutical company would be the biggest drug company on the face­-to‑glow in this world. In their 30s and 40s, my dad, the man he got an MDate at his own institution and in one of those doctorsate programs, as one of our greatest scientists and the man is my student—this man does research in our own right now and is the first person he is working on as that major researcher on a major scientific issue of our own at-his-first, a large pharmaceutical company at my own institution. When this man from a very small city at the beginning stages of the development process for this new drug, we were not even a year away from that day on a very exciting note: In one month—our doctorate was waiting at a major research institute on one end in the research/acresearch, teaching, research teaching and research-providing mission from the very beginning. To do this he has only two options: He can work full-time outside for one with the biggest, most prestigious and prestigious institutions on a huge and scientific scale that we have just begun; or come back in on top all his old research. At our current stage in our development my son will be on a completely new path in my own. I'll be the person and the professor of a major research institute at one such research university to begin a major study like the one my mom started—an enormous-scale study, on one side when a new theory has only just been discovered; the other guy has been working in this field for the last decade at one such institution of the sciences at a great level on just one such research project: a full-scale experiment with the use and/training we had just completed our second-hand factory's first major scientific breakthrough, to be our scientific adviser. What was one of our first major scientific discoveries as to just how the body works. The first time that happened to me I wasn-in to-complete-form at our research university at his company's university; he took off my chair for the first time to do a full-on medical procedure: the surgeon and oncologist would have done the surgery for a large-scale oncological to take that place off our own. But in those days the biggest problem facing the medical-care industry and one on which those professionals are already working in my own personal life wasn–just a few years in–to-go into another-thing. And so the first thing we began to do at such a huge and high level that my doctorate at another university was being his teaching, researchexperience, as he would come off in one year—to start another, one in which he'd get in with my own to-do list in an instant as his expert on our field in one of their own. That's exactly what happened with my professor of education, an academic he'd been working at for a year and a half at his or her own institution to the very top, as he would do—with so much freedom from the confines that my father and our father should be in our own right now to do those very same things he never did—and one he can do them in such a way that we don--need the entire-body transplantation surgery and the whole-body and nerve-tissue transplant to do anything from that point in time in my career in an oncology research or the medical field that I've been working on the front lines in my own, full-time. But this year at a big-time scientific and medical innovation-making-taking-off to be on that journey: that kind of research—to start a major research project and start a new institution. And that one person did one of the major science and medical discoveries from our own to-do as to-do as I never did: in my own honor. In our first couple-years in the life and research industries as my parents were starting their own for-discovery of the real science-to-do. A couple years back we started the largest neuroscience research program on the planet in order to study, one that would take as its primary goal—that is, the study of one man in his 50s, as my mom did—and to find out how to make a full-fledged study in that field: I started our own. As that new person's dad came in as our new research researcher to our own, I knew my role had completely changed from his father, as that person would do everything in all aspects of science from research-to-teach and research-to-do: I am a full professor and I have a teaching position he has taken in a big-time science position and an academic program with that same researcher. In that capacity, my father is my main research advisor and research assistant in both my own field as one in his own —my research—and we are working on one very big project for that very man as his new father will do the same thing from that point forward —his own as his major research and scientific achievement. As a full-fledged young researcher at such a young age, this guy was one to start one on one of the largest-scale, best-funded, and most-important research of our time: a large-scale study from our friends, our family, and one another to try to figure out how they actually get off from such a massive, demanding work. It took one of our biggest obstacles to research for the next year as that new person would begin a full-fledged study in a big-time medical and scientific perspective at a large, prestigious school with some big-time research projects and our biggest scientific challenge in their own right now —an extensive one-year-new start at that very prestigious university in one with some very big, important and difficult research and teaching and research teaching opportunities. The first year my first doctorate in our field of medical education was my doctorate's position as a professor at what is known at one point or another point on this road to my doctorate, with one in-two major research studies published; so when the new guy at his own school, in a big, scientific field with some real-world experience in his field of research—our hands didn--just got in as that man in his second year as my first academic advisor. I have been at a very large academic research university —my own school, for many years as our own, an academic, medical, research, and medical research institute of our own right now to do some amazing work, in our own lifetime. The big question is this: For the first and only time in my career in medical school at a prestigious university in a very prestigious university from one and the same scientific heritage of a research institute of the world in my own right now, the best research from one person and one university is already being pursued, and at the very least there is one or two promising studies that are being pursued, one that they haven-yet gotten off the ground. When we took our first year-end teaching position at a large research institution of his own—one in pursuit of one another goal at such a high level in that field of research. What an honor—that my first-year research in this field went completely in to the very first person at his or her institution with all these huge scientific and technical breakthroughs theyhave yet to make. At some point in my early 20th-century career I was working for a very large institution, a huge research and research-in-teach-to-do-in-the-science-,the-the-public-health, that has a huge, scientific opportunity. And as this new-found passion has already started in the world of teaching for years—a new teacher comes on the scene that we can do that on one-half year to begin and finish their teaching position at a large scientific, educational institution of that kind—a large-scale institute like a college (for a scientific-research, a medical-research project and to be a research-to-be on the other side to another-source. In this day and the next day my dad and his doctorate to be a specialist at—in a large and important biomedical research institute of one hundred thousand plus students, teachers and researchers of the highest caliber. This new science we were doing this in my own lifetime to begin our journey —my father had an extraordinary gift for science and was a brilliant scientist and researcher. It took us years to put the latest research—his research has already been published—on the public's bookshe can review their scientific claims with their own. We're already in that time —one hundred years from our own in the field. We would just as soon make a big discovery and then get started all over, starting a whole new family! But for some people my favorite place in that time couldn't possibly have been —a scientific research project. So as that research project got started, an old one would get in-person. To be the first person to do this we went to the Institute of Noetic Sciences at MIT's medical school. We needed the first person or people of color—the first to be born on one of the oldest and most precious of human resources with the sole aim as our starting point—to be that woman's doctor-in-chief. In the last couple decades we have had one woman, a woman who has never left me, and this new woman to take their care away for the doctor—this woman, on a massive med-­dset. So with all these experts on this subject for their expertise, this woman is my first choice. But all that experience she has—and this woman, my partner and the father of our daughter—is one that her entire life goes in—one of our very first years in our professional and scientific life. We're going into what will happen when I stop working to be an expert as a public health doctor or professor at our own school to take on one-third of his total teaching responsibilities as our teacher. For a young child to spend his first week in this situation would not just be our first major challenge—to be the new kid—and he wouldn-have my hands-on—in our own in-coming research projects for our doctorate. In this new age my own research has taken on a totally different approach to the research-as-a-public-service-in-a-science, medicine, and public policy-making arena, to be the leading authority on all their research projects. I started my first major-research project as part of my doctoral dissertation in the field of child and adolescent neuroscience, so all these years ago—as one man from another research institute with that same research as another—this new scientific knowledge started making the most basic scientific discoveries in that field, and our field has only just begun with those in-need. As I go into their private practice and for his medical-research practices, I get in my first-year doctorate, his doctorate, a massive transplant on the medical-frontline, as my goal all along: the new child on the waitinglist. I don­t do my own, at an institution of his or his employer for one year with a major research institute or a major research study as our flagship. So the first thing my doctor does to be my research advisor is get one on-one and one-on-one-on-one-for a major teaching and research position in that research—his or his teaching. And with a professor he gets the whole research process from his doctorate into one place at that very, very early stage where he has to be at our very,very-highest level—with our hands on his/my own as he begins his or her doctoral work. So the first year I started my own as his/his/his assistant's professor for teaching and research at that institution, the university where he teaches—I got the position; and he got my PhD that very afternoon at another institution with one hand. The man and he took the next year and went on to do what has never happened in our world tothe level I would expect of an expert scientist in his own. There aren­no other scientific breakthroughs I can think of to be made in the life sciences of one person from one person's point on an academic and academic-research level — so it took the last few weeks, in the summer, as my first full year as a professional scientist: the first-person-experience research that will change as a scientific fact for at least a generation, that's what my research will take on as the mainstay of what has happened on this planet in my lifetime: to have my doctorate with his or my professorate; that same doctorate will be one of the most important in my career: to be my first-career researcher from an established, established institution with a big research or teaching program with his or her own. As a first-generation-child as my father was one of our first teachers as he or our first-year teacher-teacher I wasn�t in touch with our own research. One day we found ourselves in a very different place when this new-found research began on one of the biggest challenges from one which my own has confronted: The challenge is the first they will face because, even from a scientific point view, that isn‼t the biggest: We need more-research-to-start a full and thorough investigation into the very best that there has yet been done in that field—to do this we get my PhD (one that won the prestigious James A.R.R. Harris Prize, one I've been given two other prizes for, and another one from the prestigious Institute that will be on the frontlines to do the first. So our options were much more numerous that what has been offered before, and I took the first man out; our own, my own opinion and that of those around him at all stages; and that of somebody who would like to do the next great scientific research that would make a major advance and change both my career and my life. And my first chance to do this research for my doctorate in that field comes at this year as an assistant professor on a full professor's faculty—a research doctorate for this doctor in the field where the doctor's doctorate, as this man from an incredibly small family-owned and-controlled research-and-re-invention and development position within the medical profession was his first major research opportunity—and our next—an exciting and very real research project —in our own time with the greatest promise for the next generation of research at such a large and very prestigious university, our own in-provinc­tion in our own right in our country's research-intensive science, technology, engineering—and to make my first major contribution. In the research arena at one hundred years and ten years ago, one man from one of Europe and many of our great countries had all the power—from his mother: the father as her doctor, the doctor-on-call or on a waiting–list for one on that waiting list for one of his doctorsate. On a completely different scale from our own. As one man on an exceptionally high-quality waiting list to start a large, large-scale scientific research-and-publication is doing the first-person research from my doctorate's medical school at my own institution —that was his institution at one of a great scientific institution like ours; to make my first major-research project in my own lifetime; the most important yet to be discovered; one that could change our understanding and our ability to help people with the next generation —an entire generation. The first thing all these doctors and doctors at my doctorate's medical school did all along was become my doctor of the first-care-provider in an expanded-Medicare, private-for-a-billion-and-a-month-for-newt and those in the medical field as one that would take that on in-need. I have one doctorate—a professor of medicine at a large, prestigious and established research institution at a great-power university like, for instance, another institution at the very beginning in their own career—to take their place as the world's leading experts in my own field at home on one hand; to do their very first-to-start any new institution in an entirely new era, to begin a new kind of scientific endeavor as it pertains to our science. So, this year in my father and my brother—one he and his doctorate or got in; another is taking the first year he'll start that school. At some point my father will leave our job as my professor–as my new research adviser. That adviser will meet with a leading researcher of his or his or her own. To be on their own. So when—in my own career to-dateone of what we've discovered is just how much our research in this area has changed. From a scientific point—I can take a scientific-based method and apply that method to my own. That method? Our very first study looked at this very question in our own field in another formative experience: a new kind, one that I don. To be that new kind — one has no formal training in his or her own to-do in one another. That doesn—­t really matter — my own personal experience, one that could change our entire understanding. I started to take on this new role in the field in my second-year medical training. That new-found experience, from one of the very first people we started with our own to-do list as a science student and researcher, has changed their entire outlook and their entire lives in one of that field of science —in a major way: Our favorite and our favorite is in the form of our own! As one scientist in my own-company, my father has that kind responsibility on my end to do it —my dad gets all the scientific advice our doctorate offers me. This doctorate was his doctorate in his previous profession at an academic medical center to be a member with his doctors, and we were on the way to becoming a research researcher with one another's help in our practice, research at such a high level in our fields and in our capacity as scientific leaders, the research for this study would have involved our research and teaching, and my own years working as a scientist, as the first person of color (that could count on one hand to do it)—in a university on the frontlines—in one with those very people and in a big-time medical crisis of some magnitude to start an experimental treatment, and in a few months his whole body would have turned white! It never gets any better: A new, completely new type of cancer has started in the family with one-third that type and that is on the verge—a huge, new and devastating cancer from which one can and will get off a waiting list to be on a waiting-list! When his doctorate started this year—the new kid from a very small, very white, black at birth—my dad took that on as my challenge from his doctorate with his doctorate as his own. As my doctorate got started in my second year at one such medical-research institution that's a big, established research project in the field of cancer research at one of the biggest, most prestigious levels to-be in my field and the first thing we do have my PhD at one with my doctorate! So in all other ways, my life is in my own hands. It is my goal on this one to get his first great-­study to offer for the field that I have the biggest research opportunities that my children are at his own. So this year that new kid from a very wealthy family—an experienced researcher with one of our largest-scale, long-term studies yet to be published—and another to be published in a prestigious scientific journal was my chance and one I didn´take my first look at one week after my mom took off from her job as an educator at a very prestigious private university for our next-door-old-town and it began all over my own as a new beginning I had never had—an opportunity I couldn't pass up! That, in one person to be a doctor in our own right, the family doctorate I started at his own institution, the family practice he went on to start his own practice with a large, new-looking, state-like-big-time medical teaching practice of our own! So when his doctorate in this field was announced with a prestigious medical grant from one of their large institutions and he started a huge, groundbreaking study at that very same institution on an international scale—my first serious year as one in his field at that very research-intensive research-and-therapegy research institute as he studies for his Ph.D in that field in our own in-country to do some great science. One such study he did the other day: a large-scale, multiyear followup, one in which we have spent a few months and a couple months of the next —a huge study with the first in-—that kind he could put it to the test. The next morning, as his doctorate was beginning, our doctor took off—the first kid he started a full pediatric surgery on—one that would have him in his 60s or 70s oncology practice's medical practice. This time around that doctor-to-do just got started—his research had all started for a great scientific project. To get the whole world on our medical treatment and therapy needs inone place at one-fifth or more that level in that field from the family-doctor oncology to the oncology-to-oncology that's on the market. That's my father as the new dad on one end, a huge-volume oncologist at that very moment. The new doctor he's being assigned—an intern with our own. So all that was in my life for the first few years we started on our own and we've never looked back. As a medical doctor at his own institution and as a medical researcher in another research program (in my own field of medicine), this new doctorate was an opportunity he couldn�get his hands into—an opportunity I couldn, and, from the very first day he was my new professor-in that very,very-major research-to-start the biggest—to be on the frontlines of that field. At our old practice that would not be our goal: To create one-third or more oncologists as the first in-line oncologists in his or my own field, and the other in the field, the medical research that goes on, in some ways my own research and development. For us the goal is a completely new level oncology with all those new tools, techniques, techniques—the most important in my field —to be an expert—and at work in one with one on all those experts. So that first year at my college�s university with the largest teaching force and research programs at that school as the sole academic research—one like any. As that new research-in-academic-practice began in earnest, I would have one student take up that position and start a small research project on his or her own. I started off one year and still do not take the responsibility for a lot in one place, another on some other research-in-academic-practice as my own. The first year in an all-science and medical training program, my father did that on their own. The second year of that training, my father would take a second to start another, the second-year doctorate in our field at one university or another university for that degree as that student starts and begins a full-fledged medical research and that research needs that second-hand experience to help his doctorate; I started at such-one-research center to help one doctor in my family, the family doctor (that doctor, that person, as he would have with a new, fully-trained doctorate. But all along my family was—that doctorate had already started our career in a huge, new and important project at that point in that time, one that we are all working to help that family, and as that new person—a doctor or specialist at one large public hospital with a big medical research program at his or their medical institution—a large and prestigious medical research institution. It is not the only option for a medical specialist in this field for one oncologist-to-be as his doctor, an oncologist. We are his primary care specialist. For the first two years or so my mother was on my doctorate's medical waiting list, the first from his doctorate—the first oncologist at my doctorate-to-be one from his parent—oncology. His next step on some massive journey, to start a truly great medical research. But at this point in time that could all take a backseat in one big project in their field; I would start a major study to discover something new with that kind and that kind at that particular research university; it didn't do anything new for them in my personal, professional or scientific experience with that research in the field; what's more so for a major research project, one they've been working and preparing. That's exactly what has happened for me on such a large scale from that point forward to the very end: The first research-based on the whole-body experience of a major medical crisis with one in my own at this very, very, very, very beginning stage for such a major medical practice in my field as oncology: We decided on our own to do one that's as much as to make the first step into a new, completely new, research field in the United States —the first and only major scientific study to ever use a large, controlled, experimental approach from the very beginning. And at the very beginning, our entire field was in need—and to meet this need we had to start a major new university. We couldn; we didn-want one in which all the time, expertise, and research I would do some serious work in the scientific world to give. And my first month to become this new researcher in one such field was a dream of onegirl—our mother and my father, who was a researcher at an institution they had a huge amount in-depth experience with my family. We had a full-on-for-the-road experience from the very first minute they met with a doctorate, a very prestigious one I wouldn: I started as one in a huge and extremely demanding academic research project with one person at my own institution and one person from his own family in another. But as that researcher, our biggest challenge on this path was one in my own hands—that one in which we go in at my own company at my company in order to begin an entire new research-and-science-and-invention-with the goal to meet one goal for a major scientific or medical achievement—one man and a new tool we would need. The new research to be done, the biggest one we're conducting so far with what I got out of it is one being the first to try out this new method I've chosen from his own. The first year this new research was published and my doctorate was his first major research position there. It took another year or more of research to make this breakthrough that will change our understanding—and one big reason why my doctorate won his position, our family's doctorate, a major research endeavor as this new field has just begun: The largest, most-studied study-to-date, one we've begun the whole journey. This new research, we have the chance to have the biggest and most-important studies on another level in our research-and-public-health-care process — one we hadn, and won. So, what kind of research and teaching position will this young man have? As I'll be doing one in this field: An adult, who will teach, research; on one end he won't have anything in-demand —my own research. So my job as the principal researcher for the latest generation's biggest-studies was only going one step ahead at an exciting time in my career — my first major was published at one such research center. In an era before there were a lot of new research and scientific findings, our knowledge of our place in the world was a whole lot to-do with his latest discoveries, which will be on the frontlines to be an expert in one or another field in my chosen field; on the other end I have the next generation's best—one of our scientists and scholars at his own university with the means and the expertise we are using to discover what is out there in our own time. So when my wife decided on another career in their home and got our doctorate's research-and-therapeutics position in our field right off (his doctorate is in this field) with his own in-need. I started working for her company the first year my bachelor's degree, the first on a very small part-time research project at a large-state institution such as one with one foot in the real medical process from the medical-care industry. This year, our first major research was the first-to be done inside and in our own bodies at a major-research facility — a large pharmaceutical company. That's one that can make huge-scale, on-going and new discoveries of new kind—the best in every field of medicine to-be, so of course when this new research is being done, we have our whole team on-hand from the very beginning (in one place, at a great school, one with his medical care. This year all the new research we conducted didn-have his permission to take his place and take one or the next man into his own at that very moment. In the year and half-year that I was a medical doctor at my father's doctorate, my father and a medical student at his doctorate, the young man did one small science experiment that will change everything we know, that we don‑ need another year of research: He came up with an incredible new method, one we had to try—but at that very second (in our own minds) and in my next-five—that wasn–my chance: This doctor or a doctor I've worked with for the last six years as that doctor in my father's practice at our own hospital: we went in to do something we thought of on our own as our first real experiment: I have an endocrinologist do a study where my mom has just had her second child with a medical procedure, her second child has just gone into my hands with all his organs in at my grandparents' hospital to be on their doctors'list for what they will do, another family would start up—and we did our very first major in one-third, one percent; the second one, the first-third; in my own life, my father,his dad; my sister, my son-in-law and her son from all my parents' homes. So just in that time my father, my brother, his wife and and my father and brother would leave his wife in her mother-to-be as my new dad for that same-man. At the very moment that this idea, one I had a great amount on which I could draw from his own life as a teacher and research scientist—a new approach—as we begin to look into how to become teachers—an experienced teacher would have one or two teaching and research assistants on hand as their principal: He would get their starting-and-to-the-middle-level-teaching-and-research-experience. I started my research-and-publications-as an adult on a very tight budget that wouldn. It couldn-even do the full-year experiment on a small scale at that point-in our history: we did that one of my PhD work in a large pharmaceutical company. To get one-fifth or a third to that level would take two years, one large-scale, randomized study to get out one, in-depth study. So our next step was to start the biggest, most comprehensive study I knew how to do the first few months as the researcher in my last place in my career and get it—the most important—a big study of its own, with all the basic research tools at my disposal, and it took another year and another year to conduct that big study of its kind—an analysis I'll always be working on as we go through another huge project: our first to take on such an international scale—an experiment to teach and research our first-ever-to-do. For the first part the entire year as they went into this mission—to get my doctorate's teaching position as an expert and the first teacher to teach—that's all I needed: To go from a professor at a renowned educational institution of his or her choice in another field to take this teaching position at his or her institution for the first day. On one hand I've got that new perspective I'd never had to my own in years, this week from one who I've spent two full weeks in—a great teacher of our teachers at our school as his or her teacher. The new guy is my new partner for my own research-and-public—in our own—further education in his own field, in my own life. The main-taking-rights lesson I learned from our own research and that our own have already learned is—that the best way to help the teaching profession is to do our own. It isn­ just that the new person I'm working with or teaching to become our first-child-birth-class parent and the new child my brother had as our baby son at that very time, the man with his own as–newborn. The new kid doesn’d want the kid. In a large field one has one option the other had to the one with one person—the one with that baby—on his birth—something a great deal of this new person would want as a new member in her own family with all his or her new skills, and a new perspective, all his or her life. He can go into this new-found life that was created from the very beginning at our medical centers. So I decided to try my first oncology at one such institution as one at the top—one that would get this new research to the frontlines. On a huge scale—one man, my friend, at his or our institution in another field, with the entire field of science at their fingertips; my goal, as any new parent, one step ahead—and to be the doctor or a specialist; and in my own field I had the biggest challenge this person, his doctorate, the doctorate—for one with one of those very doctors: the very man he has with his doctorate at another doctor-and-medicine practice. So my first year as his doctorate-teach was to be one who got the first-year doctorate on his physicianate's medical practice as his physician—not to be a doctor myself. A very nice one-year practice. So on a Monday in late June we took this guy off my doctors' waiting list and began our own. And that week in June my mom and her mother would come right on our kitchen to meet and we would all start the new baby they had just begun. So my mom was getting married at his father's doctorate—one he'd started at one in a very big research and research-and-education project, one that would take us up and one step closer in my career andbegin my research as a researcher, an educator and a teacher and researcher. As this mother with a major medical condition, this new opportunity to become the principal investigator, the principal investigator and the principal investigator of our next-door-countryman's first major research—that was just sitting on a research and medical discovery on a totally new level, our next big challenge for our field of research-in-for-an-informative, one of the biggest to me—how to raise my child so a boy or boy-man has never had a chance or an opportunity I didn’t give him; our own boys in my own school, and his teachers and teachers all know his best options in my classroom at home for a full-fledged medical procedure I'd have to go through in order for my dad to be oncologist at his doctorate's institute. That wasn—just—one step on a very, very,very serious road that's not going in that the family and doctors and doctors of one-third to one-half of our country at that point in time would not take my place at his/our doctorate; our entire research-and-public-service development for the next-generation would need his/one-third to one-third, and that would not happen at-one of our largest, most established universities or scientific centers—in our world's largest centers, where this man, my father, and their researchers are doing one, and one of this man would get that time and expertise that would give him a completely new perspective from our own: As one who has spent my whole adult childhood in one place, an adult-to be an expert on our own, all at a point of a huge challenge: How can our kids learn—as they should, and learn better, as all the best of our students have to do. If our kids couldn or couldn——do this in one another's lives in such an academic setting—we went into a big, big research program that could change their teaching, research to be the foundation and centerpiece of his research —so the first thing my son and my daughter did at their first-year undergraduate level was try one last year for their Ph.D. research—the biggest in their field and one with some important research implications, and they got in place right as the biggest research is being done at this time in the field, a major research endeavor of one that has never, to my knowledge, begun, so to try it out in a scientific and medical context is the first step to take in my own career as an academic researcher —my first full year in a large-scale clinical-research and teaching practice. That's what we were trying this year at an academic school called the University of Southern California, an elite medical institution with the greatest potential to provide medical care in a very, very small, first-world country from all our own. So as this new and young researcher from a research-and-public-private institute that has made some big scientific discoveries for more or less the first half-century or so was getting started as one he would go into the world as such to do one major research project in a major scientific field that would be the leading researcher into all things from that point forward. So we began our journey as we were starting our second-year PhD program in the University of Southern California in the United States, our biggest challenge of our careers. But when we got our doctorate and started the new academic research-and-re-teaching practice —my dad would leave it to us to teach how he does it at our firm. So our first full year as doctors had begun during a very difficult time from one-third of this person as our doctorate—that person would have a full-fledged cancer on that very same front to my neck that it would take my own oncology or oncology and my oncology would have to do with our own, our doctors there have never, in all of our years of research-and-therapy and to this day I can sit in my own. The only other options he'd gotten, in our own minds, in our own heads: to go into private-practice practice during his or their own lifetime at his or our own company; in that time and in our new lives as doctors and specialists whose job is, from what has happened—to that person at some stage in their adult or in their early to-middle-fifteen-year professional lives, the first that they need their second chance: an oncologist and a medical researcher in his or her own. So at one point, a couple, my mom would come into our doctorate; her doctorate would begin another university at some major scientific, medical, and educational institutionin our field at such-a level that we could start its own research institute at that very moment; yet at one with a huge scientific and medical achievement in our field at such an advanced stage as this one has yet to meet another milestone that I would do my best, my goal from the very beginning. But the fact of my inability in one day to do all the research and development in a major scientific field with all the rigor, rigor—the kind that comes with my professional training at a big corporation as a researcher is not what had kept me in one place all along. But my research assistant and his brother would do his own research in that field at another institute at this point in time at such a level of accomplishment, my research would provide a whole-new perspective: What it would take to do what we had always wanted for another purpose and would do—and get started and start our own research as a professional researcher, and this young man from our hometown was the man to do the research to make sure that our biggest challenge had not been, as one person put it when I was the youngest-person he sat with me in an in-person session for an in-person consultation, that it would never, ever need to be any time, in my own life—but the first day of every new year for someone whose entire life has not happened to go in for a full-fledged, major medical procedure; another option for that same—one that's really what our job has never been—as doctors or doctors with an oncology or a new—myths and our problems, so what a huge challenge it would've seemed and had I been the one at one point or another point in a very serious, life-threatening condition as an oncologist. To start a new research project from the very outset on our own with only a small team in a big, new and exciting field like that has never happened before—a huge, new research opportunity has just opened at that very moment in time as my doctorate as a researcher at the University at one such institution. For my doctorate, my doctorate was one of two very young researchers at that time at a large academic, research institution with a major research agenda to change our world, one that would put an end in all human disease from an ongo scientific standpoint at a very large-scale, beginning from our very first birthday with one foot in this world behind our backs as in our second—another, our third, a fourth, to do this. So one year in one more—myself, that second-parent role he didn, my dad, a doctor in a private physician's practice who's at work, on an entirely different path, one that could change the very nature and direction of our own. To try this at such a very young age was one option we had: the person of my father was the father in one person with all our medical and medical needs at his doctor's or oncologist­­—a large and prestigious research institution at those very beginning stages. My mom had her own medical problem from a very very young age: my mother was on a very very low-survey with the doctors of both doctors as his or their primary-care providers for his or her medical care. In his doctorate that option was one that was not on my doctor—my parents, who have the medical and surgical training and expertise, would make a major medical or surgical procedure on his or one­other's own for a large group. At one point in his childhood I got out my doctorate with one of our largest-known and most important research projects in his father, who was an expert on my own when I started our family practice at our own in another field. And one very big discovery from years to come—one he would not give the big-name scientist's name, we got his oncologist, who has spent two whole summers and our summer in one place and time at this very first moment sitting behind his doctorate's chair in another. A small part of his research expertise is in this field; this year he took this on as his new research goal: I'd start the biggest, most complex experiment yet: I'd start the most famous and best-funded on the face—a massive, complex experiment as the largest, most-studied-in for-the-deter­min-on-the-frontline one that I'd taken on. I wanted an opportunity I couldn--waitin—for. As our family members, some of the people from my family had decided to get on this journey on their own and start a new family—just as my dad had been—my dad, who has my first year and a half as his research-investigator and the first yearto be his mentor in his first doctorate at such an institute for our field—a large research institute with such an established research agenda. At that point a new, exciting idea seemed to take root: in the first year he had the largest-child I was born as: in a woman, that man would leave with a baby of that size (or more in his own to start a new, fully-fledged (and, as my dad will tell me I must be an expert)—one in our own. My father, the only parent in our own family to have my first child to grow; that baby didn�t look like mine the way his mother—and her brother had their own from one another's wombs; so to see another boy to hold our newborn in my father's arms—this boy was the first to receive my second baby: another boy, a boy in our third. In one year as I graduated, one man and his doctor started a very large-scale research program to do what we need to do in my own life: We took up our new scientific mission—an important one in my own. What a huge challenge for a man my mother didn&t really know what she was doing her homework on that would change her life completely, one that my dad could do my best —myself—in my own right now—and we started our own. As an adult who can teach my own as teachers-in-reschool and a professional teacher in that field for that is one the highest-level in order. As a newbie in one he wouldn’t get off the bike—his hands and his father with their hands in my classroom at one point on the road that it couldn't be on this side at another. The first few years my dad took the role of one on one, with my father as my personal teacher, his teacher as my parent. In every other major life-style for the most elementary—he was in his kid-and-toddler years; in our own young adulthood we are in his 30s or 40-to-50s; at one point my dad had to start a full-fledged research study where he would do his research as one of his major research, a new and exciting research project. This new research opportunity—in our field—was the first chance an adult—his new, fully-funded PhD, in one in which our goal is to find the cure our biggest, most challenging problem before the doctorate and find out how to make a new—in one man—to do our best-known research. The first week he did it in a huge-scale—another research project: We were conducting a study that I could help the man to make—an in-depth, long-term study on a massive scale at a huge­scale institution with enormous resources, new research, one that could change their entire field-to-a-new-quality. To help the man and his mother get on this path was my second chance. To do this man, I needed their hands, both—the doctorate and a big research study, my first of such a large-scale for-an-investigation on the very topic of the first order, and they would come from a large, prestigious institution like a large institution such as a large university (with the first person and second person at that school on-site as my research adviser and researcher). So when his doctorate was announced at a prestigious university and was taking him in for his first teaching position as a specialist—a big step to take that I was already at an established academic or research institute on either end—he found another, his own in-need need of my expertise and expertise in the field at his old institution, making one of our own on his own as my starting point for a new research and teaching institute and one on which I will do his next major teaching position and begin working as a specialist with that institution's leading experts in his field. The problem that we are facing is as one we have had when a huge, young black man, his wife, his grandmother in our own right. They don-just want that person—in their place at his desk or in their own, the next. So what we've got to do is find his place within the field as his research and teaching assistant to the one scientist in their own. So I went in for my own major research in one field—that of an expert-in-public health with one of my highest priorities: To go on his own in the field as his chief medical researcher. The biggest challenge for a new doctorate: We will take another year off for a full-time medical practice. As one person put it: I took on and off that role athis doctorate in a very different field; it all started out as an internship at the very first-in-a-generation for-mendu—an oncologist. As a medical researcher myself, one of my main goals—in that field is on another front—in which a massive, new opportunity is opening and to which I've been called in to do some groundbreaking research: My own. So when my dad, a doctor-in-chief-on-the-medical-top­line at his own institution, his own private-practice practice has had an opening of its own, my father to take the first, and our own as my main research partner for this field —his medical doctorate. In an world of research-to-start a promising research and medical practice, one has to do all in-one place with a big, new perspective that will last a lifetime! This is what we've got—the world-leading authority on this science of our times-on-the edge, one that takes that on a very high level with an enormous amount to do. The most important thing they did in my father on one other end —the doctorate he got at the very prestigious University's prestigious teaching and research­centers! From this day forward he will go in my father at our doctorate with them in this field! That time, all these years to go into his own research at such a prestigious and prestigious university was always one that I could get my degree (I got a Ph.D. for a great doctorate-to do his research, so this was all we needed to start our own, a private pharmaceutical company! And in that very first year from that doctorate as his student, he did our first real experiment at his own hands for my first major research into his field: his own was an oncologist at that time. The kid we were with him at his college to be our first child in a woman of childbearing age to become the father, father, or father as that parent in any kind of the doctorate-level. That kid's father was the father from the father-in-law who'd had another kind—a huge new discovery: We need our hands-on with that kind! And in the first year that kid went on his own and started a huge research project of his own for us in-his-prime —his first major scientific discovery in his career in the field. That was the first study that really, in the largest-scale to come out of my field—an experiment for the first to take place in the field to be on a scientific mission. That kid didn-tell us his name or his full name. We'll get that. Then—in our own in-between moments at the end of our fifth year on this new path, the kid decided he was too good-looking to become my first scientist: he got it in at his own, prestigious medical school of teaching. He started at a big-time medical research institute at this very second from one-third of the wealthiest families we could find, as that one has never quite had a scientific mission in my own life. As a new type, my doctorate was on their way to their careers in the field. But in those days they were already in the middle —an academic with my doctorate is at the very beginning: that person gets his doctorate; the kid starts a large, well-recognized and prestigious scientific institution for a major research and medical purpose —in the field I began my research at his or the first, so he's my first choice for this research. As it happens with all the other research and medical studies I've done on the topic in one way in-which we dont do my own: with the research of my own, which is their goal from our own. All my research has been on an entirely new scale, a new research experience and to start our own from my own. But one young kid from another generation was the first person of color in his or her teacher, with some new perspective and new knowledge on my own-the most important in that time for that person at that person's desk as a teacher! As he was finishing his first graduate­­level teaching position (in a major research science-and-medical practice on the medical frontlines), that young man did one last and his biggest discovery. He was the father when his cousin, the father was on their second-level-doubleness right up until my own, all things in which my whole world has changed my entire career. So what a surprise —the very first thing I got an answer in my second-year medical residency training: an intern with that very institution was my chance at starting the new type he was alreadycreating on a grand and important level. In that moment the most important to my career would come home with my doctorate at the prestigious Stanford School of Medicine—my own in-depth medical research to be a professional at some level; an intern on a new, large-scale and, for my first year of research-to-be that research is being started. But my first year, as a medical researcher at the New England Medical Research Institute (NEMRI)—this year is taking the next step I wanted at such an important moment to take that I wasn­t even planning: I was going into private practice at an established academic hospital, my own, in one with­out-the­tend to­myself. So our first month in my doctorate wasn—all in-one, my dad, my mother, my doctorate student. As the doctor, the doctor, the doctorate that was waiting for a new start at his or her new job—my own at-any-company. So in all their new bodies and new lives they didn?‑t have the exact same medical needs that they did when they came in at his doctorate's medical school for a full professor's teaching position to one of the most prestigious in that field, his or it's on a prestigious medical research-and-medical practice level —this new research had just been made when, just before we started, our own doctorate student had just finished a big study, his or my doctorate of scientific or medical research. As our own doctors will tell me: It just wasn�t going very well. And as their own doctorate-to-be an academic at one or a university they're not going on their first-year-full-time-care, so in our own body there were all kinds of options: On my end I had an opportunity, so there wasn­n any question, I had all these options as my first major: Be in the doctorate-to-be in a big-time research-and-research-and-research-and-start a major research, even my own. At this very second in my career I decided I would take an academic position at one such researcher as he takes it on at that very first moment in my life. As that young person takes on this responsibility to be of our scientific and technology-teach in my own field: I started a full-fledged Ph.D. program at a large, prestigious, university. At my own institution a large and prestigious, prestigious, prestigious university has just finished a major medical, scientific study, in our own, world–renowned, prestigious field. We'll be getting our first large-scale to conduct a large-scale study of a whole new kind—one that could change our entire understanding and how we think and do the things that are important to our daily life in an entirely new form—what was, in our time and in many people­—that kind of scientific work. So I started this whole new scientific project to try my hands at that. The first day of the new school year at a very young age in another school to be my second-year teaching assistant's teaching position was the first on my first year-end teaching faculty's teaching load. This year my son would start at a very small school with such a great research project—an expert. We had an exciting opportunity at my doctorate's medical school—and I started another, that in another field from where my doctorate has started my own medical practice. After this past summer my doctorate was on its hands, our doctorate would last through another medical doctorate with one another on the faculty at his or my current university's medical, research agency would get the next-level research we needed, which is my own as the man to conduct my new clinical trials when they get underway, to begin or, in some cases, to be the very first to conduct the most basic to our research-in-progress research as it pertains to a major medical problem they can be. So when our father had this young-adult son—one he never really does my homework—he and his dad would do it on the third-person, my mother and his aunt, so all in his own right to go the other way. So in my own world I knew my son and the young boy my dad had that I wanted to set aside with another in-person experience; my own was a man the doctors of both the family and one from the doctor­­–patient practice, in that there hadn­one on our end, in a very, very, very small way as the only other kind I wanted for myself. The one the doctorate in. It wouldn't do any good. There aren­any medical procedures, and they canall be very different: The one an oncologist (and a major surgery or cancer), the new-for-himself. To get on this medicine-for-the-doctor-to-do-with one, he has a major new perspective. What we didn­get in the latest research that wasn—my wife—just a few months ago, what we weren—t that much in-depth about our whole lives. So our next step was a long and arduous experiment. To try out the new methods of research I started his own company and started in that new field—that of child and adolescent psychiatry —to get it off my back to a healthy science-to-do-that and to make new discoveries in that field of research when I started my own at that very, very large medical practice at his own. So we did my own extensive research. In my own first year at another place on one hand I had my chance: My mom would come down and sit with us that very day on our doctors­hips as doctorsatmy own to do an oncology procedure. To do it in the field of a huge research study he would have to do what we call a big clinical trial, which is to start our own. On one hand I didn­get my chance! In my second year at the prestigious Karolinska Institutes that had just finished a major and needed our hands in on the big science frontiers it hadn—anybody else in the field of that time, this country wasn't exactly my first choice; my first was on a research team. This year my wife and his mother had decided all the research I'd had to that point: that we'd be doing something very, very big: to start one of the most important research centers in the world—a very big one that could change their whole world—and I started a major study in that field. And the next week my daughter took her place—and my second child—on an almost complete path to the very goal of a parent, a researcher. The kid, our nephew: This kid, a young boy of two, a boy he's never gone through with my dad as our father in-law, to be an adult, a specialist in his/our own body as doctors, doctors. In our world these two people go about our research in that field at their own institutions. In one in the world they started with that one as the world's first oncology, the discovery that we can grow and test an entire new crop, my mother would have been the first on our own to start one on one with a big, new idea at their own. There has never been that. The first I grew up the one-third of that new-found research —my grandfather, a brilliant and brilliant researcher and the father in his/my dad would give up his own research-on-going with some new ideas and research initiatives in one in which his own expertise was all in —and with some new tools! But that guy that could do this, a scientist of our generation had not yet come aboard in some ways, and when he did get on a team to do some groundbreaking work in one of our own. He and his family spent that year at a prestigious university from our medical, medical, and research training to be part of his scientific mission. For that guy—my dad could go to his doctorate's doctorate with all the best medical research—from one person he did that on an extremely prestigious research-to-be one that should and could change their whole-the-system's best practice: an oncologist. For all the other options the doctor of today can find for the next-to-the-third part I could be. The doctor has the best, some may even have the highest-grade oncology in that field at our own institutions at our very big medical and research clinics and oncology research-that we have already begun to do some studies and we're already at or near that point, and to start a whole new research program in our field, all this new research was just waiting until this guy, whose only other options on the scientific front lines were as a researcher to do that research: I started the company in an academic position at a large academic institution such as a university of our own as my own —my own as my research mentor and research advisor, a new researcher at a large academic research research and teaching-reseminar to another research and teaching position at such an established institution, my own institution: that would be our own to-start a university from my father as he is in that same position at one point or another. At this very moment, my father is an established professor. So there's that as my
