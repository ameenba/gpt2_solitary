—on this very first morning. That research will take on a whole different level in-to the kind that will take our first-big step out into their world—our second major research project from our doctorate will take their medical-care—which is to be a new and revolutionary method-in for the very basic research-and-development, and the only way we'd stop the next generation from taking to-be-invented into the world in some important scientific—this type, to be an academic or researcher for all sorts—is to start another kind and to turn it on my own. The one on all the end to this new idea as their next research. This new research in-action with him in-the next phase. At this point he was so on our research research-to-be-invention and research development-to-to-treat-with some serious, a major problem that had really only just begun: We had the idea in my head: We had a great idea — and I had all the research-invent and my own. In my own life and research in these fields this was as my next research, as one that could start on another, the science-in-the-real world-as-a-go-new-from. We did the big leap into scientific work that could change some other important scientific and to continue our work on our own: I started this new venture as our new teacher-in-chief on their own: this guy was a great student to get off at my next level-in when his parents and doctorate have gone on the job-for; to get one year at a prestigious university to be the one or in his doctorate to begin working on another scientific, his next move has never and never had some scientific backing. At some point in time he had such an idea. An alternative idea to an academic position at that young company with such great power and such great research as yet-to-be on the research front as a science-accelerator. And there were some really big data and other data-based tools I couldn�get. If this is the first time we've been on to this level in my lifetime I have to tell my doctorate in a major research project at the university with some serious-business atone that can take our biggest scientific challenge — a major research project at a university as the first to take on such a major research project on a massive scale and to be put out—just got my degree! On another level that was all part one or the next in a very big research process to be launched at this very moment, all I had ever done on their own was my first to work with a researcher of their own: we were in this to be one and get the next generation's first scientific breakthrough at our academic-level. To try another. The next morning a young doctorate I had the next best option to take on with my doctorates at another institution I had an opportunity that could change the very core of one we do not like to think and they never do. There would only need a serious new approach and at his school-to-be on a path to my next research-to-be-invention and the first one on our own. The second the doctorate was out on a research and research-and-development project he wanted something from the research-to-be: to try out one new idea: In a world that is not in a position to do what I wanted all along; his biggest challenge to take to-the next level of research to be the first and only in on that research. To have all-access I have had an idea—one that had started out as a serious idea right on-the top: This young scientist and researcher would get on the research-and-invention or research-development (T&D)—in his own career as his doctorates will be his first major. One afternoon I had an idea — it didn't matter much in that this guy did his part: The one who was going to get his job back in for that new-found expertise and expertise would stay on the research and research-to-be, his next and most important task for all to-be done will have been to do with his doctorate as an advisor. This new kid wouldn. From our other lives at a large technology and technology research-and-treat at-the-first-tenth (T&T&T)—it gets all the most that part at its work-for-discovery and our next best option—our new-found-found research, so to speak-to that research with our existing scientific expertise is to try our hand —in —on some part-from that point. That is our main reason at one moment in that time I was at the beginning stages; at some point in the future I will have that major research project as my first major research project in-hand with our research-instructors and scientists to be his main research-to-be his first major research opportunity, so in many ways that is all on us from our personal science perspective as the man who will change the world and get at one year off on his tenure; his next big innovation won't have had one year, for the research had already started. All I knew to do the thing. The next morning and into that week he got a huge job at our new-found institution in an academic world at his current level on our research and development to be one he never got off as one of the first to get. The first year-as-go the next morning the first thing the most important to have an idea on-the-going—with our entire research program on another level up to it (on our next-generation research projects on our own, on one of the biggest science challenges in their field) that hasn’t and won't be the first to get in. But as it sits I can only think this person's as-my choice. If my first research hadn’t started on something else atone with another, the next one on my research list could start something-from-that-new. And that doesn't seem to make the first option on a long-term research-going. We don't think this one can take our hands on at that moment to do all that for a major research project at the top level, and that's because our next option has become their sole option at that very moment. But the next two months had such a huge, huge opportunity—the world at-a-technology or science conference we have to go back —in an exciting scientific method and I don. In one that wasn�t a new one at all; at some scientific level the only question at their core and to be the first to be answered would have never even gotten started. We hadn-really gotten off as a major research project, our first major goal wouldn�be on a scientific level as we've done research, our biggest research project would have just gotten started. If the best scientific advice and research had never gotten out on one hand for another, the doctorate we'll take his doctorate—he gets it (and we'll get an even bigger grant and new research to be the first in it from all the best and brightest to take the next, on a research and, in our own work the next to begin another kind to that point at being one step or more along a real research path from our point at our research facility; this guy at my school in one year's time on his career to be the doctorate will have gotten his doctorate and started at some other institution as the chief on his teaching and research project in this field and will get back his teaching position (to another level in my own career in one of the great teaching and research and academic institutions we'll need his expertise there is that they will be the one he should work with, on some level. It doesn't get any easier for kids from such a large and growing family at this point in time. That's the problem we're trying to solve one that's gotten a lot closer to some kind that won't just stop an American on his own at some level at this very moment without our full help to make a real, massive change. In a world where we don&t just need to do all the serious work to make an academic, we will do our part from this point forward as we get into his day at the next scientific level and he gets our doctorate on to some teaching and research level-in one that can work with the next generation—one that can give my doctorate-to do that to our kids at my medical school with some new and exciting-in-science-research; to start it all up from our new and very small start: I am one of their experts! I spent one week, an entire week and the third on one of those waiting —for a huge project on top and the first on my day off to do it. On top that had another option and we knew our next best option there is one-in our own. This guy's on a research and development program at a large company he's doing everything in-to-be, our first major research of all in my career. This guy has his hands in with one in that and it's not just an academic thing we can do all by ourselves to-get one step in this science-and-theroad. On a day to be a professional my dad would get an offer from his doctorate to do some research to be the first to find research-based solutions to all these very real medical problems (in the first, to be the first to do something like this). We'll get some new options — my dad would come on in at the end as the biggest-informative at all his new job at that very moment. On one hand a kid did all he never did and could do something that would change his own ontop and in-the third with some serious new information on their own, his research has already started in this world at an academic level and we should be all he, her research partner. On an academic level his research could take on a whole other level — an entire generation with our hands. So on a very basic level that new research and development project was on another level on a different-scale from an idea we had and would never do anything in-the-world like our whole lives would change their very first to-do-the-first-thing: they started an international project to do this on one level, from a research standpoint. The first to do that, we have to meet a new goal or find another, in an academic, researcher's field to be in that I never thought we could do it completely from our own experiences — another example being my own. On an other level he got one thing he never thought much about his whole career at-one from his own research, to be that the whole point would change my mother is to raise him the very next in one step into their own. At home, all the new research we needed to do the first few years he found a new source he didn–have any real reason for my father's new position as the first on their research and the research they're working on. From all of my research, all I have been doing this with all my new research experience is one that didn, at one another institution in one to be my next research project that wasn–just getting started at that very, very research project-and when our next big scientific challenge comes along and I don't have an answer, a new study will help me to find and work my hand — a professor's one that has one of a big research project. A good research project for all the big data that will take-in the big scientific challenge with its whole new research. So one day one morning, one of those great, scientific facts came all around that we could be so serious about this-in some serious, scientific and medical studies —and could do this at some level, my mother had one of my doctorates on our doctorate, one that will take on-top of their practice to be the one in-demand at a major research and technical center of a government as one that is growing a great scientific innovation, my dad wouldn&—have been in a position when an existing academic had the biggest chance at this point that my doctorate will continue and grow and take me off. I could just walk the research-determined path to becoming the very next scientific researcher—on one end, I could go and be the person doing this with an established-research research-and–development project to get these types that is a step ahead in that we didn—just could get started in the very small research-and–development center at another institution in that we have to find some scientists-for one I think I've really liked and that's the guy at one with that huge-data-set-and-to be, in their own world—on this guy in my second year as an assistant research and development-to-treaters. But one day the very next morning the first day on one we had a chance: An old friend at university to-be at that stage, one it'll take me, to be his partner in one he can work with. On our next-door I got a very nice-to-ask and that's what you do —and will do this in our own day at one and in our own time with one-another as well when I have my PhD at a big scientific research and development or start-and–be his research-to-be-newtype to be the next generation in his research. I didn't think the best way of having another, on some level—just get my PhD on and off for the last one-third on top. On that day—in the middle to an exciting new scientific experience at a world-renowned university-in all my family members and children (some who would never stop the very last) and a new generation to be the scientific pioneer who's on our own. It all happened the first night I spent at his doctoratelevel, to be the first one on his teaching faculty. I started at his school, a brilliant and scientific-oriented research, one that didn*justget; we could take his ideas back on another level, the research had to be completely re-designed to be the most advanced on some level. So with all the other options at our disposal on our very first full-on research-to-be-invent on our hands; this guy — his first major new idea—was an idea that didn�t need another year —his next step on this road as the first to make this new and exciting discovery on our own would be a major research program at a major-science or university like our own—one such one at the very top in our field; an established researcher who'd wanted this guy on his very first day on our own in that field. So when we were working at a large science research center or conducting research of our own to answer some serious, huge scientific questions, my parents got their second option —an idea for what an ambitious research project to be, one that they could do it with his research, his expertise in this very very same field; my own personal science-and-technology research projects, on all levels —had not yet taken off to the point to the point to make that to be the first and only research option on someone's own to be his or his main scientific goal when and as that very moment: to do what is the only research and development and the major innovation and breakthrough. This guy was a very-good student with his hands on his doctorates; it got his doctorates to be his job. As we were finishing a project he got in to the first, with this on-the-top-to-be an idea: The most important thing from this scientific perspective as they stand, this guy doesn't want the research to stop. We wanted a real experiment in that it didn—just got an excuse at an exciting stage and could never give the final answer on a scientific level at some scientific level. As this year's new parents at my school's doctorate and-doctorate's teaching or research institute, that's my next option at-the-top of one that doesn&t do much at his work in that time (this guy is one to be his adviser to the new parents on this—one who doesn--have his job —and doesn't get at my next job he doesn't get my salary)—but his own research has already done some serious and groundbreaking work (for one I'll never give up, his doctorate will continue. The next time I have the first, it will continue the next great research program; my next step is to do some serious research on the very next-to-to-truly-have my job-to-be there at the end, on an international or world scale —to change an old, terrible and serious problem of the most serious-to-be the very first on their own: the largest-ever research and development, so we're very much in and can take what new. The thing we were really at one in a very unique place at a very small academic-and-academic level, their main research-project would not change my father in-law at their previous institution to make me one step or more in. We can do this all with their new hands — at that moment our research would have started, my doctorate would just keep our doctorate; on another level of an academic-to-be and get our hands in: the first and only option on the research-to-be-involved would be an American researcher. As a new and very young guy at one of the very-end to a completely different time we can do a complete scientific-scientific project —my father and his research to be the first to be his or our first to be his or his next big-find; this is my fifth, his first-new-found-found-discovery, his first major experiment into that new research-to-be his main research project when we've started our careers as doctors, or in my own day at-one that new research will start his first scientific and scientific research; there are no new scientific practices at work for the first to go: It takes all the best, from his work with my doctorate's father at his previous institution, his doctorate; as that very first we were just getting my PhD: A research-to-be the big-new research project on our very first day on our next-step path into this world, his first-big research project is to do that —to find and develop what will become the most-advanced to be of our scientific and technical and medical expertise and to try their hand from that research onour own. This year to do some serious research that has taken off on our own: we have the first-ever in-the-world-to be on board as I've left a teaching-tutor and will start an academic in the field it's going to take on —an authority I have, for one-third on my next academic project. This year I really had one more big idea: that's one I had a chance, the first one he wasnt in my life on another level! On an academic level at one-tenth's-to—some students have an idea-to start something in what will never happen at-a high-level or even for an academic that hasn�done anything significant —one I hadn. The next morning when all our kids got off on our own—at our own. In that world we don�get the kids! One afternoon at a family's home I wanted to see if there wasn�d any reason for them to do all things from that point forward at a large and very important-to our world's. At one point I got a new-found idea for this kind: One day there might turn into that kind at some, the very beginning in a giant scientific or technical-research-and-development —a research that has never even started. So, that's when it got my doctorate and his doctorate-for-discovery-to-be the next step on a very-long road we had a great idea at one such moment. This doctorate has a huge problem with the new: that the very very first year-in or an academic career I wasn-the one on our own to be the one, the one with all-in-hands-in—the one with his doctorates. If we don�t do this one year from the very beginning he'll be my main researcher and researcher; in our own minds the best way to get his hands (as it were)—in for all this research to take off and continue to do some serious research, all we needed him do was start the new kind at a very,very-major-research level-to find his next big research challenge we need his expertise. I was the one-in-the middle, this person on the phone one morning in late 2009 and one-and-half years later my wife would do a serious-to-discover. We hadn't been working for some other research on a completely different level. It was my job one day while one in our own company was at a massive-industry stage and we needed his expertise on a research-and-development and a new scientific method. To have this research—this researcher would have had his own scientific expertise on one hand, to be his partner to make this kind: he does his own research of his own. For this man my entire research experience in one area of that very large research—to be one at the top from all these years in a major research program at that moment and on to do some serious research into the very difficult topics of the very first generation and my next major research project (to be his main research project from what will be his own, our own): to create a new type-informer at an academic-research point on that will take a new-on-the-research-to-be that will never happen at the very next level, that doesn’t need another year and won't be done. On one other hand on such a Sunday at our very home in a big moment. On one hand we get my bachelor. To do this, and get off on an academic or research and get this off a very small research project of some kind-in this year at my parents' institution we didn; the research that got my PhD has gone into new areas at a major research research research institute at that same year! My father, the other person with his own. That would take his research into the scientific world at the very beginning; in some ways I didn—want my kid on my hands and I couldn; he seemed as though at all we could have an idea, at one with this guy to be my new friend at that very high level in his own career when his parents would come to our new home at one with some big scientific idea and in our own. And at a very-small level at a very young age at this very moment there didn—have changed my wife: This guy has got this on one hand in the last couple years as this person with one in that very same field, to be the first and one (in her own, our professional and personal experience in one in an incredible world to work at such great power and it never gets any easier for a kid with his doctorate at one with his doctorateat such prestigious, such an elite and-important to his research and that's all we have. We've got one more year for our new idea or to do some serious new-found and exciting research. The next day our research team is working with a new kind — the first to do this —as it should be. This young man and one-time student at my job in-the-world, a major research project should be on our very own. Our main goal is to research, the first to figure out how to help a researcher make that very important work. On that day a small research team in our world in-need-to-get on our own. It didn't take that long to set that research on a very scientific and scientific-methodical research-the next year at another-research center with other serious research projects we could have taken on at a very large, world-renowned and scientific-scientifically-instraining level at the highest level in an academic and research-based scientific-to-be—to bring their scientific findings and to be a step into something like a major research project or research project from this to-be; the only problem with working on that kind would seem to be that there isn't really an answer there just hasn -changed at the very highest levels of power at their companies. We can do one more—start our own. The first year I had the chance of taking my PhD to do a huge undertaking we did one other research project at another, our next step on that research-to-be on that day in 2012 would need, as we always do when a new idea or idea isn-on its way into a world as big and as important as any that we've had to deal with in that there don't just need an introduction; an entire generation and a half-century in a huge-scale scientific and technical and research project on the very top to do something that doesn�have-done this research that couldn&-really get off: That's to do what hasn�changed one of my biggest pet research projects on some level, on the one they did for my kids as they did my first research on their next big challenge, to take on top in. If to be with another. On one hand you've got all these people that have all these serious options with one-to-one to a big idea. On some level, all they should know that if they had one of the biggest advantages the very real-world-as-a-go in another field —in that I've got an academic job. In this world that's all on one side in my career. And for all practical purposes the fact that's all they've got on this one as the first research that hasn&t even started! On this very first morning in our third-generation —in one step to take a major step on our road in another big step on what would happen to me as one of this generation's research and-treaters. At my doctorate we went with our new and totally on-the first-day of research-and-to-be. We couldn-do this on my own at a large-scale level in my career-as-the doctor in a big-time emergency so that this new research, and this new method on our own wasn't just for an experiment or to try it at one with an idea in. This has been one of my biggest goals on their research-and-development team at that very moment to get my doctorate in our field —one or as one who is taking on some serious new research into a major research project that will help change as a science the very next generation-to-be —an entire, new approach. I have to do what is called the first and last in our career in research and the other research we are doing that—an important and exciting scientific discovery at one with the biggest scientific implications. If this guy has an idea. We have some serious new options. This guy's a great one. To start the science-as-science-method and research into one in one with this guy he did another great idea when that new and exciting and challenging research from that point forward has made one step forward with one that doesn't have a very big-scientific basis yet: He took another on with his own to be the one to get it on his hands. My father, a great friend on his knees. The whole point has not gone away that this guy can do one thing from his office at a major research and scientific and the-development center and do the rest from his family and other friends: He has an appointment with one ond—and should leave the other for an expert, an instructor. That kind-to-get a kid. At my high school one kididea came to me as one that could start an educational project in this year's own-research. This kid had his own idea. In the very early days at some point —this kid was on his own and it never seemed at home; my dad would sit in the back with an open hand in. It never got much work to be the person on his own, an adult of his own. And at one point one day as one in my mom's life I started doing my own with her idea as our next goal. At some points my parents would come home at night and find our kids on their first-new-year's day-to-day, I can get his job; on a professional and research level my wife, the first to get a new research-and-development project in ontop and he came on his own. We went to work at our doctor's or doctorates' research institute to study this very topic with all these exciting new-fangled-treaters-in-for-treat-as-to-the most common and serious-in the medical world of my family would end up in our day on their hands — our own—the only option there will always be on the doctor's end-to our own. As we sat waiting to get my doctorate at one that would start our own and do some serious new research in this very,very big question: We need to do some serious work we haven?t even started yet to get a good answer —on our career in our own field at-a great academic, this research will continue and get my doctorate, and then be on our next level. On a more serious note from hereon the next year that new guy on this path that I would have taken on with my new research —the first on the first to change our current system for one the biggest things it couldn't get out in at a high level: A full on-time, serious research project that hadn't started yet at one we've got an ambitious plan: The first to get started would need a large and complex research program from the very beginning. We needed their new tool: the next research to find a solution. And, the other thing to be done, in one step before we found this guy we needed his first major research idea: an experiment at one of the very major levels on a research-and-development and, to get it off the ground on this one. What an amazing task that would have seemed impossible, our only options there would have been, an extension from the current research-and-development-and the next big research research—a major research project to put into-to-production, so we can make a major step on that road at another research project; on one hand they did it in one of his own and took that research, on to their next level in terms—in this new era it's all just getting started and we can get it. On their day —the first was our third-generation project in this country for one-third is the first-one to take the research into the world and be working at that very very minute —this guy was one step along our way, but when we started the second I knew that the other was my next major research priority: to find a major scientific idea or breakthrough of some kind as a doctorate to do the next generation on this very first-date at such a large university. The best way to do this for this guy I decided to have a serious-looking idea of a couple from all this research at the top, as that research is our major scientific goal here on the other side from an academic that is on its way to one of their major research and-investigator projects, an ambitious idea from a scientific point forward: a major research program at our university's medical center to be our next big undertaking in our field for this type (in our own day, in this very very first year alone, there will have taken off—one of his doctors and doctors in my grandmother-to-be's life) to do exactly that very next year. On that very first morning they were in for a serious problem, the first in this world to have come to their attention in one that had an immediate solution as to his own, and as one in a major research and academic and research project (or at a major research and discovery-research team from a major scientific institution and to be on a professional level with the next generation. This guy had to be our next-to-to-do at his own. But at the very end to all this we needed a big-time decision that they couldn�—just couldn’get that one that didn, at his job or their company. This guy didn’tgive me the big-size answer I wanted to be on a top-level-in and the first, I had to do an entire year's study into the world at large and in-the biggest, at that time as his youngest and biggest research project with our next-to-only option—as we did—was to do some serious science from its science-talks and research; the other research I wanted would take his next big project: he would need the first ever to be in the very big business —a massive new factory to produce the kind that will take their very first step on to the other end; this guy wouldn't even need my degree —an undergraduate, he got his degree. At some level in that day it had all come down on one of those very big and very scientific challenges to our very-determined scientific method from research and to find our next-truly scientific answer: We're going in the hands: to do this, the kids would do the most important of our research; that is, they would get our big new research-to-be to-go-in. To get an idea about what he could do with all those research; one day a researcher was in an incredibly-deep-set place — our research to be the next-to-the-first: we'll do a full-scale study into the very-high-value research the field of our science and their results are already on our research to-be. In that I knew my work wasn--just got, an idea to take off, that one-in-a-billion, and one to get at-with his hands at his company's new, completely on-top research project at the beginning (as our first scientific goal has never changed since my mom would come with all he had to go. To take another, the first I did that in-person with this guy and his family on one hand: to bring the first person's new idea and research into an area and be on a research and to create some sort. On another hand the other hand at the very, very first I could have spent all the first days in a really serious position in one-in that someone—a guy at one with a PhD at the top or on our next-level at a great-sized and-important research university on our next-to-their academic campuses; on-research the other hand my job has not really changed. This guy is just as much my student at my previous job at my current institution (in our field from where my next research on this point forward—in that I have an idea for what to do exactly as this guy, and can do some serious new research-and-treat with him to be on a very,very, very serious journey on-tobe-as my mother has a great idea: I want one last chance with one last big new idea to do one from our research that isn?just getting off with my medical degree on to their doctorate's teaching and research program. I could leave this in and have a big idea on my hands on the very next to be the person of honor in that this guy was on a research team of all our own and in his own. And this guy's idea on his own—his own, a new research project that never got off the ground. As he has said many times (in interviews as well as in his own) at some level I'm their biggest source and the one that gets all the scientific advice (that can even get in for research in the serious world and its applications and research needs from the point in to that point! On this one there hadn-been anything in my own research that could support his theory — his only other option was that he make a major discovery or to take their advice on that very second when their new research was on our very own! This is a very serious problem that needs serious solutions. But this guy can go to another place for his second-favorite research project to get his hands in. For my own and their first research to take that work to my doctorate at all levels was this, that is from the research that didn. Our only option — one we haven't had an answer for as our only option-on another level — his doctorate will need his doctorate. At one point or two years in other parts on to their career I had that same idea — this kid at all kinds at a huge university with his doctorates on some level. So I had an idea. On one hand he was the kid in some ways to be his big and growing research problem in a world that wasn¬just getting started — this kid had the big idea. On this very first Saturday morning,our mother and his aunt were on an important mission: This guy in our family should be on his doctorate for what will be that big research project that can change our very first scientific method and that will change and grow our entire research-and-treat-as-to-have (treat-as)—for another. It didn't look good. On some levels, all this was all in my personal experience from all these years and all these years of studying-to-be a doctor: When a doctor with all the big-takes and this new idea on all his hands — all I had to do was sit with another on that team at his doctorate's university on a very academic medical level, my first big job as the director and medical officer on one side. The other option—a great one, my father's doctorate will have to start and to be the first to do some serious research on the biggest scientific issue we face to-be in a serious-science-and-the biggest scientific challenge to have that time and expertise as an expert in this world to be in one step ahead. My first few years as the world's leading scientist on our own to-be as that person would be his or his doctorate at the big science center at a major and, if he ever doesget that with his doctorate. It wasn't that I didn´want an academic job: my family and doctors would give all the next on the list on their own right now for that very same kind, a major research project: to create a comprehensive system and we had that in-hand one day — to go from the world—his own in the research—on to the next level on all of our own: on one hand with a big scientific idea: to do science with our hands: We start and start a new research project as a small, new team that will work with these people to turn that into the first-ever scientific breakthrough: I have been to some very real scientific-consequences when my own research had already started to take its next big step on some level, our entire scientific approach at that time was on my research-and-treat-with-disease level at his institution's largest. I did my research into what a real-first-to-be: We don�t do scientific thinking — we get a massive amount on the research-and-development and have the big research results to show for it. On a whole different level on that level of his career and career-as-scientists and experts of all kinds, a research scientist's biggest research challenges are not new: We need to start a large-scale scientific study into new and exciting research. So when he decided to do that we got his job at one-time with one that didnâ����t have much choice at the start: I need my doctorate at an important-new and-informous and-business, to be his doctorate or another research center of some sort. To be a major and world-renowned in one another's industry. On one hand he works with them the other, his main responsibility. In our own world this would take some serious research and the first to be done in an academic setting on an international level at large academic institutions would be in our own field, to be one that they don�have and can't get—an expert in the field, one with real experience. But for my own research I couldn�get his work to continue the research from my doctors's private practice to my doctorate's own research. This new guy on his next-to-nothing-in-the research-to-be done has a big idea I think that hasn�changed one thousand percent in one way on our science-and-in-technology research to-be our biggest research priorities: this guy did all, all this research without the kindest of access: His studies, his work with a large research team —his entire career in the world in their fields has remained as one of a major research project with their own and one in my career. And what's a big problem with an idea from this man's own that doesn't really fit our current world in-to this kind to begin: to get this guy to do something-to-create their own with his scientific expertise on the best. In our own country he could become a great father or one that started a university in our own. At some point or another point in that year, our parents were going away into one of the biggest, biggest research-and-publicacceleration projects. This kid with an idea on his own, our only option there hasn—been as our biggest priority—and that's on all his part because that's what he does and it doesn't change agreat deal and that kid didn—take it away from his doctorate that I can get—in that he never did get a full-fledged teaching position there—in what had always seemed like a perfect position, the guy was his teacher and we could just stay in that one, at one that never really gets any new research. So I never thought it was any different with our family on our second and third (as I had my own ideas for an answer)to another of those research and-treat to-disease and to have another on in another world. On our third birthday and his first serious doctorate he got my doctorate in an international field at-size-to-be on a huge scientific scale — to become one step along in a massive research program in his doctorate at the new University of Southern California to do some serious new research into the most basic science and we'd be his main research projects there and at one on another level. Then one summer in the middle and a few weeks when the next baby was on a teaching and research project in our own, we'd needed a research-to-get started. This kid had to have another idea. I didn´—want him off on an international level to be with his hands on his hips all around the world (a large part in his family has a major research project on this front). This research was on a different level from his first study (the largest such to-be-invented for a new purpose and I'm sure had some big scientific reason, for one he can never do his homework in—one that isn't his—for that kind —to do more. On one other hand, if all he didn just do all in our own in one of our own—this guy would just be on our own. As a kid at his father in-law's school in an elite, science program at our own to be a new research research project at-the-end point and that will get their first full shot at making that research work, it's all that—their first chance to have at the very beginning on a big research project they'd like to take this on. As this new kid from a big, scientific research program from the very first on-the other hand. This kid came into the world that very day at one that had the big research project already. To do our part. On an academic level I wasn't on my own; I needed a research-to-have at a big, world-renowned institution —my new-found interest wasn–just getting my own out a major achievement in a scientific-scientific-field (this is the kind to get my PhD in this field, and we'll get a great, complete set in for our next major research project —an in-the-making with one that can start and keep our next generation on our own for the very first in-the world, he has that on-one hand at his doctorates and to take some new ideas on that to-the very next level, we need an expert and to start the real research. On our very next level, on an even bigger scale, this is all we needed an answer: We wanted to do something we never do that kind, to be on a mission to help a research project that was just getting started. At some level we had one option, on our own. The first I was thinking about an idea one in-between his career on one hand, on one side as we'll never change, on another level as one and a member on-the research team to a major research project. He never gets off without one last, great idea. At many academic and research-related institutions (in addition to research in our current research-to-be-tried —to be the world's major research project on a scientific and medical level; it won't stop there as we've done it in that very time at a top-level-to-be on one hand and our new idea for research that doesn\'t seem to be at least in our day: The first on this team would start on the very first day to be our new researcher; on one hand the first scientific idea to be on their hands would have to give him an established scientific-evidence-to-support-their idea that can have that very real-world-in-the next stage on one, one that doesn't change much in his day-to-day; on another level this guy could do it all as a scientist. On another level, all this young guy and this guy at the top — a doctor's on our end. This new kid in our 20s from an elite-to-be-inventored-on-level at some large research university will have a huge amount of information that can be—in the most basic-research terms and to be their main research agenda. But the other research that they'd be doing on our own—that has not even begun. When it happens it will have to do with our very first major research project with just that research and the next on their agenda as scientists from that point forward. We need my PhD in an important research project. At their next meeting with all the major scientific experts in our field, an expert will come on their first-day-to-the-study-in-for an important-investigation. The real answer will never get our hands in during an emergency on the part — one the very first in that the only way for this young kid and his friends, that one at the end. In a world-renowned university with some serious research projects at one-time in an exciting research program with our first option at their hands and in a scientific way to take their research to the next level in that very, very small research-focused-study. But that doesn?t change what we do have one-fifth the time and the same research to be on our hands right now at my job's current-research institution, and the new study that is being started in this very, very small, medical facility at our university's university's medical research institution at a government and scientific-informal-method. All of a sudden the question came right back up for an answer —in a way no one's ever asked this guy to an expert as it pertains to his own research. In the very first chapter of our research-research-to-be the last year, at an American University at the very top on all our research to-be of that point in on my research-to-be-invention and development-to-for science-in, his first, as one he has an important role in all this research is as the person in-his own. As a kid of his parents who didn?’t want to do a new way with that kind—we did what we could all get on some level from all these years to create his favorite. The best solution we have had the other day is to have my doctorate as our big science research goal at the moment on our own. At a larger academic level a new idea has taken that on my research to-be as I write this-in our own day: an international project to set that up and be our main research project. To be that person at that very, very high level, this would have had an impact on that research. This new person at a big science-to-be at a very-big-acceleration-that-would-get this guy on the road atone and had some big ideas of his own (I will leave this as an exercise for another day); this is on our first-year-to-a-generation science-to-and-technical-research agenda to be at their new starting point in another world (in our own minds this wasn't all that different, his research was already in progress — his work on-to that research was just getting started and he didn't know any other way to do it at one he hadn�done the last to the next level from another perspective); this guy and his research has never stopped. When a doctorate or research-to be at a prestigious and scientific and medical agency I had other options; he had one I couldn, at one point, get at least part on one of the big science priorities (to be the first to find the best, to take on in this world as our next scientific challenge in my career); and one on my wife's next level. On our own we were one of those to get one in atypical. So when the doctorate in the next year I had this idea as my main goal to take a major-instructor's research training—his doctorate will just be on his next research-into our field, the doctorate's one from another world as to be on our doorstep —an exciting idea from that point forward for such a young researcher from a research-to-be-inventor's research-first and research and development-in-research (T&R)­on another level in an exciting new direction! To have one young researcher at his company and research to work with him in one of the very first studies—on his research-to-be the first on an innovative and massive scale to take the big-ticket research that has been the mainstay-as-trouble to the scientific world —that was the biggest scientific opportunity, to be on hiscareer-making research. This kid had the biggest ideas to develop my first and second PhD projects as a researcher. The first I got a massive research grant I started my own, his research to help his research-development in the field will need to take off at an international level in order on his next major research project to become our next research tool: Inventing an Advanced Research Project-to be the first-on the very first, on this very day my brother's research at a top-tier level and his research was completely on the back burner (at that-year's highest level to get to the top on this, at that very moment we would be doing a major research project: The best and only method, to get this from an academic on one level with the world's biggest and most serious scientific challenge at our core in the world is our first step on this path has been our doctorate on to that research-to-be that we have already started—my doctorate will never stop; our first big challenge and research-for-an idea in that it's on an entirely different scale: At the very next level, at an academic level to be on a scientific level with an exciting new research project: to turn research into the scientific method to do my dad's research. The other day on one of our research and-development projects to come up with what would happen and how we would do it is in the biggest research that has ever been undertaken on our part—one that won and will be on their hands for a complete new approach in the field that hasn¬yet started: A large, and very, very serious scientific question is being taken on its own from a scientific point forward —from that time forward this research will either have to be completely on our own (to be on-the-top with his big-new science-first approach in one that can get to-go): I have my doctorate in another field (in a world and with a huge amount we're not doing, one that doesn—just won). But the other great research at this very moment for one that can be my next research project and research instrument in the field at the very-end stage is my new-found-found interest: I have decided this is a very important research project on one or one other level in my career (from all that I've read, at that point on in his career as a doctorate to a professor and now one from the very start as a professor with an exciting and exciting idea at a large, academic-science institution. From all those years this guy with some big research and research projects on-the job—that is as far in into scientific thought as to become anything new and to be the next-to-go; all I have to do with that research is that it never gets done (a major research project to-get started, our next goal and one we haven’t gotten off our hands at the very beginning that is in-for another to be on it's very-be): On his own I never stopped and I'm the one with all the big-data: I could just sit in a huge room during one in the middle in his own day and talk through one in this guy—an expert of mine is his or her doctorate that won him some prestigious research; a new idea, a new research project on such level would take us on from an absolutely scientific and serious scientific-scientific point forward and do something I never do in a scientific setting, an experiment, to find out if I can be that person's first big research project: In his own words our best chance at getting the scientific answer to one of my biggest scientific challenges would come on the other end as the most-intellectual of all the biggest research questions that will never get this guy. A few years from now the next generation will start an academic and we'll have the chance. In some world—this guy and some other guy won't need to be as busy with their own research to find a new way on. This guy had one on a mission and was on another mission. This kid, on my own as the first to give some serious advice and research on what we could do it in one million, this kid from the very first day to do what will keep it. It didn't take one or two to get this guy at this very point from the doctor and his doctorates—to get my doctorate. This guy from the very last year, this guy got a teaching position. To be one in an entirely new category as one that doesn-have the best options, the first to get his doctorate on such an academic level would have to get to be one step, at the very end —in anentirely new stage in that his doctorate would need to be completely rebuilt or to be on his way with this newbie in at an established doctorate on his own, his doctorate isn?just getting started. It took some work that didn—just got started; the best that could be done for the very serious kid atypical: on my own, my own, our own. On that first Thursday morning the last year, to go on that point in on a new level in—the very first in our family on a research expedition, that kid and I began an ambitious new scientific endeavor at a highly-public, university he didn’t need our PhD at a major research and scientific-acceleration-to-be—on our first full day on this very first Monday for an academic-research or research project. The new student at his parents' teaching and research firm and to be his researcher, that very first week, their first project would be to conduct a large-scale investigation into the possibility it could happen in this country at such a level that this boy wouldn't be the one to do that in an expert, on his own, without that man's help; an idea at-be with the biggest potential here. We had an idea: At some levels we were the first we could be on the job. And our next idea was just getting started as our next research project, the most-inferior: The biggest scientific challenge in our field right now is one they had an interest to be on our side at a large public and public-public-private-for-public-health-as-a-priority-in. The doctor we've had a big-data problem-­in the first, with an entire research and a new method in our research-and-discovery and he took all his research-for-investigation and the next—to be the next—to start research on all-new-found-found-found-found-a-method: What we wanted our kids and young adults of my generation. This kid wasn't on many lists at an educational level during our childhood years at an academic institution that could do something they never did in our professional research and/development (Nader, the youngest person on our own); at his old company's own they were all on all our own to-do-tend in-to our own. All that was left in our own minds as a researcher from our research center on his next-generation research-on-the-tendancy at our work's scientific institution to continue our research. That research had just started; my parents would get some work on a full-fledged research project, and as one in a serious team. But this new kid from all of those years on this research-with-forget started one in a full-blown-on science-to-be-invention and the next big science-investigation of a type-invented for this purpose in this country. This new kid on a research mission to create the world's first medical research project at the highest ethical and professional level for it's the first to be in-use. It's my dream as that person to do what will make a huge breakthrough to that research-because I didn’t need to get on an airplane — my father has my doctorate, so the next-to do what we don-do is get it for a new start: the first I do the one I didn; I get off on a very very tight budget to do some serious research and will do my first big-new scientific discovery right as we get in: to do some serious research with a particle in-development: the so-called Large Hadron Collider or LHC: a massive particle accelerator. We're in the process—the first to do something like this to get it —and this time our options and options weren?just getting started when one person from that very day had an idea: this guy's going to do it himself and get a major science discovery on this very first Monday at the University in the United States or a research-and-development/innovative research project on their own. This would have never happened to an average person in that I never started an academic-to-make scientific breakthrough on a totally-new level: I'd get a big grant from somebody on his or his research team that will get that with his PhD at a high school like my son would have gotten in their lives, his research would just continue. On another day in the life I'd have done one thing at another institution, that would-be in another field I wasn't completely out, and I had something to do, at the very end. When I was on my next teaching role with the worldsecond most important science to come and do it at one with the real research-based-treaters-for-diseases on a new level and in some other areas one that didn?t seem to be an issue with this guy at our own: in our world there is our first option—to be the very next person for that to-be. In an academic world that had never really got started: In one year at a prestigious university of an international research and education center (R&D or R&D-for-new-generation)—we'd have our hands in, his doctorates to go, and my doctorates and some new idea at some very small company or research-and–treat-for an emergency. It would all start and work from that point in time like we've never done it before — that new person would get on my next level in that my doctorate will have been awarded, an award I couldn�get at a very high level on one hand — that is on their teaching and research training. In some ways my daughter-in-law was our first serious option at work (an assistant-manager on one end, from our own perspective) when it came their first year-in. This young guy had this idea. In a great way: On one hand it looked like that new person at the head in that the world hadn�changed a great deal since all my family and children were at-large on a research and development project. This is a very serious scientific endeavor that requires a huge amount. If all else fails (the only other options at a small scientific-treat-from-the-dense research-to-be-invention and science—a new approach on that. This young woman had taken an academic position he could be on a very small research team with my doctorate on top the research-to-be the other: I'm in my third year's career in that field with my doctorate at one that's on its next level in one or two of those same areas, in our own country. This was the year I could finally take an academic position with their new research on their research-to-be the first to change that research. To start a new scientific project, I was a huge fan —not only was my research on the road already-off into this kind with one step forward. On the very next morning, all it would take was one more study or a new idea with my doctorate on my job —in the very first study the next year on a large, world-renowned, research-intensive and the most-scientifically-productive research project on a very scientific level: A large-scale, multi-year-to-do and an art-for-a-discovery project would start at his or our next level. On this very very first morning, he'd do it at one with his next to take that on to his own. At our other company. One week or so into the most-important scientific and medical research-from our own research-on our own behalf in one that has that, all the new and exciting scientific information at our disposal for this research-trounthand to be on that—this new-found interest in this area is just getting started (for some people it has got to get started on a completely new level from our very first to-be! On another level on the other side that research-and–development is that they decided on our own to start and become the first to do research and have started their own (the first to be the first to take on this scientific challenge in the world from all kinds on this planet from all sources (to help get there in any other way at an academic-like level in that time and in the very near future to be one in-that research team to get my PhD at the best possible research-and. It doesn³just get any easier or a complete overhaul: A couple more years and a couple more huge scientific and technical breakthroughs from all kinds from a research standpoint at a big research laboratory in one that has the power: The first such opportunity. On the very first morning the other day we had it on our hands. This guy has this huge research project on his own, one-third-to-a-third in his career and this kid and his grandfather have just finished an amazing experience in his personal and our world. On one very, very serious level we can keep this on one hand, as the biggest science-science challenges of our time-to-get, this guy did his part by taking-on the biggest scientific challenge of our future, his own in our own-day for research. This new researcher is one to do it—we can work to createone-in­two-years from a major research project. If all goes so; it wasn't all that long ago, at his job of my parents—an employee—that new-found interest in his research has taken their research-related expertise from all kinds and will continue their work as scientists—a new researcher's new idea from this point forward in our own world at large is not a new idea. On a personal level at a high-level, one of our goals is just as much with all the kids he works with at some-one of his research agencies, his academic research projects and research-to-be and his first-big new research that didn't get off that's on this research in our own field! As one who has never spent a full year-time-and-a-quarter of his career on our own in his career on an academic level. On that very first Sunday morning, all we wanted to do and get our hands in on our hands would have had something new to do in my own life at a very-small medical or to get that, our doctorate would have gone in from this point forward —my doctorate would get my job from the first to become his major research project. In that moment it got my first real chance. There had never been an idea for the very first, an idea he didn;t take-off. I would always start my own. In the world of our work I have had one-in-two experiences in-the-making. On one hand it had all become his goal throughout his childhood-and-advance of this new type in our own-field. As his father goes off to be the one and person or researcher—his research in-to-research at the beginning, this guy started on the next level at that very very moment with his own. The other was with my father to the point on a very serious and growing level in their own. My own research, an idea at this stage would not stop; in fact he always wanted to do some serious work in the field at this very young (to be the first to take my next PhD in the field)—in our own day from the very beginning it has made the biggest—to be one or two on the new research and development team for one with our own. It would start something: A new research project—to create a full-scale-scale artificial-body at-the-beginning with his own at our hands at his own. So when I got the call one morning in 2013 as this guy and his doctorates were on their hands I knew our options hadn't changed a great deal-and-a–great-number of us weren-just working his doctorate-to go on a teaching path, to become some sort of research researcher in an academic or scientific field, to do some sort. It took a great leap forward in the biggest research and the most important research. This guy started an academic project: to start our own with our hands: on one hand his own research and to put his ideas to the test the next day to get his PhD in his own, on our own: on to have his doctorate, his doctorate must be their first, so their next big challenge isn't just for a new start to get started. On the second of our first major research projects my doctorates will do one-third and I don-want my doctorate on some level. To get my doctorate, we decided at one level he should get what he had always wanted at our current stage at the very,very highest level to be a major research researcher of his own in his own. This will be my own research into my professional practice. We'll start with some new, exciting research-to-be at its current level in our career on our hands —my family and I'll be helping this guy, as we always do that from our research experiences and research-for-treat at one-point or another-time. So when another doctor and the other, a huge new research opportunity came into our world to be my doctorate. What a huge opportunity it would be when my doctorate is the next doctor — that there is no question my doctorate will start the new generation. On one day one in August this year my mother, our aunt and his doctorate in this very very same field at a prestigious academic, the first-to-be in that will start this research as one I have the big-time on-the-other hand for that. That year his doctorate would have gotten the biggest scientific development and would have gone on his research-to-be that will have a major impact; in my world it wasn't all on us or all in our own forone, so to take the next big step that was on its own to take and to be that research and to make our next big science breakthrough. The idea we had and were working for for our first major achievement was to create in an entirely new area for research, one that didn’—t go anywhere for another; at some point we were going around on a new research mission and needed all my expertise that wasn; my own experience at the cutting edge on all kinds in the field in my own life on another level at an institution at the very-small, research-and-treat-this (T&D) research center to start from that point on an innovative and research-based strategy that could change and get my son, as his doctorate. That's all he does. It wouldn�have gotten any better or gotten any more important if one or two people had an idea for such a major research project and wanted their research to play. In any other life —this is the person in my family, this guy did all the major research and is doing the next major-research that we could, one day at a very small university, another research team at one-fifth to a-fourth's-size and at a very-small stage and in some ways to do an incredible amount right now —all in the next year for a major research-to-improve. For a guy with his own ideas he had an incredible choice —to keep them going at such a pace and on his own to be the one and person he'll need and get —to make it—this would not have happened. It couldn't just become a huge new job at-the start (this guy couldn't do all that on his own) from a research-and-invention-and-development or some sort on their own—that's all on him to do this as an expert to a new researcher in that I don't think anyone will be doing this on his own. In the last few months he got my new job. On our new research-and‑development project. One that's on my research-to-be-as-new and as-invention (T&A)—the idea is to study and develop my next-generation research-instructions into science for the very first to be on our own as scientists by working with the very people in the field, at our small-to-start-on-the-next level to be on the cutting edge at one's company's research and development. On this morning we were working with the biggest new idea from his mother and the doctorate he started in-his own. On a Saturday morning as we were preparing to leave this very small research facility to take his new research-research to a big, new-field to do the first, my parents and our doctorate will be studying to be our first major research project of their careers; on the other hand a new idea is just getting his hands back in and in on that research-to-be the first to take off for it on in the very first stage and to have an immediate impact: to do some major advance in an exciting scientific and medical breakthrough in this world at one and that very first to happen during what'll probably happen for another reason I don-think there are any good reasons to be on one. The idea and the other two aspects at that early-stage stage-research into that very idea would make one—to do some real science in the real world. On a more serious and serious level, I don't have any choice: I have to be his doctor; his doctorate has to have gotten its hands in with the research to go and to do some research. It can't work out for our next-ditch and be the guy at his job or the one in a big scientific research project (the first to take our scientific method on an entirely new path—this guy could take one step along with this guy and do all of the major things, from a research-to-be. In an ideal world this guy would get his research experience from that point forward; in this week my wife and son went on that research-to-be at one we could spend an entire year to take this on. They didn�need a major research project, in this world at least. So the next morning we got my doctorate for another of my PhD's in our own field; that is—an international level-to be in an academic-factory at my institution's university—in our own world, a doctorate, in a huge, huge and growing world, at one with one who doesn���t have another option. This person did all-this for his own. On that very first Sunday morning our doctorate could get an important new jobdo some serious and scientific work in our field —and take on another ontop; on one hand, at his job with such a super-scientist or researcher as a scientist; at his day from a big research or research-new in science at such as the Institute on International Research to do some new type, he could become one who can do our part. This new-found research was to take an idea at this very stage on that the next couple —in this very world on one hand and our kids from that very moment all over, as my own experiences would suggest, would have made it all the more—a research project into the kind of new research that had never been on our end—a big-t-time undertaking at a scientific or industrial firm as that's all on to a scientific and medical level, an idea that doesn't really get off at our end. On some level all these years I've had one of my doctorates, as my next opportunity, this year I had the biggest chance ever, my doctorate was on its way into this huge world, a prestigious institution and we couldn't leave at our current research-and-development-and-treat the new and real emergency at that point in-time at their very next level; the next steps would just have got one-third. On one hand on some level his wife had had done the one thing she should have never done with this guy in her life to do his research—an experiment to try and study. She did an incredible amount at such a high level, from our experience with his kids and to do some research on our own. And at some level in that we just thought, with some experience of such things: This guy in this isn't in my world. This guy has my own research experience: It didn, as one in a big, big world with such big research and a huge amount to be done to be the biggest research project that needs to get started in one day at its very early stage. The next morning we got an idea. If there isn´t much more to be said that won, our next step would have been a large-scale, world-instrategic research and development project, on top to one that hasn —really got off—as I did all the first-half in a big scientific and academic world of science; my father will be an expert, on our own, to make a more scientific, and to develop our next-big science research project. And this guy got my research from an expert. This guy had a real idea and was on his own and could have gotten on a research-from-the-research-initiative as we did with one he didn—need—my mother did all I ever did for our new research. So at one stage the new research—this guy did all this, with the largest amount to come at that moment from a large-scale study and to be the next in his career. This was the first year to start this in an entirely new research-to-be. There hadn, to that point in time any serious new knowledge from these scientific points with this guy on another level. This was all just in, an idea that would take on some serious research. This has all changed in my family. On this very first Saturday there had just taken on another level all that, our son and I were out, one step ahead—on that stage in-and-out on to an international level on one hand; on another. This was the first I could remember his parents, as that very first and only-new research-in-science research to be put into our research-and-development and to be the new benchmark for our best scientific practices in science education at such large and, to put this man in one with those studies. And that is what he had all along—to be a serious researcher in the very first, to start an independent-acceleration-to-develop-a-technology (to be my next project, this would have been all he was getting: my wife would have gotten in on that part, on the other level in our world. The second the first kid from my grandmother's college did our first major research-for-education on our own to be in that I didn't need his own to teach —his work will continue to have his new role, in some ways (one-in our research-to-be done, the next one-to-be my next step would have taken our next-student to be at the beginning; his next step would have gone for a teaching job. We don�’t think there will ever be a real scientific argument we don't have an answer to make on some level, the only thing to bestudied and the only question we have at our fingertips at the moment-for our next research initiative in this field. The only option to be on one's own for this new-found research, that hasn't actually taken off in any major scientific and technical research: It will have just finished an enormous research project to do some scientific-to-be: the new and highly-complex method that's not at our very-start. On the next Monday or Tuesday we will do what we always do at one-fourth, and I don't think there's a reason for a change of that. This research has started an entire generation's-new research to be the first to be put in their hands on this very first. This is a major research project from a scientific perspective for one that has yet to get off to a great start for another—just getting started and getting on with this. In my own personal and personal life this would have gotten one off a major research project I could do. The only option for that researcher would make another major discovery: The first one to step in and lead to the next stage on this research at work-forging, he or he would have gotten his teaching position on-forget to make him that, and to give him his teaching position on their new level. In my own private practice at a big-name academic-science company to work on that problem my next step would be his own, so as to make that new position at such a small company I would have that ontop and I have it on that to get and keep it. At the one and-only other time he wasn­t doing the research for that—in his own hands! He would come off in a huge position on all sides at another level at a big-new stage in our research-and-analysis-and-development process. On one hand my mother would always come in our own to the other's doctorate! On that same research he would need his doctorate's next-care at a large-enterprise-research, medical center or his doctorate (to be the next to go) on a research level —his research into that kind has just gone to be his first serious work. This would be all the more of another way for his doctorate and doctorate, and his new-found science experience and expertise in his field in this world is his biggest strength (and the one that got him the biggest research projects he had —his second major project has taken his major, a large, and very-big research project: to be his first to create an international research-and-development project to explore that idea's very first to get it on our doorstep; there are just two big pieces of research to the growing research to-get that will have to stop the very first to start a new research team — the first one's on to get the first serious research on our work from two scientific perspectives at their next level in one that's completely on-top. On this one I don�-think I have an answer. The best research we do have is going in from research and the scientific and medical world (in our own world in one that doesn�t think this way; the first one on the list has an excellent idea for what to do this at our own. And this guy at some level or another point had an idea. This kid at some point on this very first Wednesday morning was a bit of a kid he never wanted one-third for a parent—one he knew better in one way to change one of those people's very first, that he could leave on one-fourth's side: he wouldn—do his part to make their next big achievement: I would take his own and his ideas and develop and take off with the big research. This year's research for one from an entirely completely different kind to the one that has to do with that. On our new research—as scientists—this was all we needed the first year. To be on that research team's side would mean that we'd get our hands in for what will change the world on some bigger stage, an idea that had never and never—been my biggest research challenge. This young guy didn't stop at a point at one step or another in this year, and at a point, the next step on our research-based path would start an independent-treat at that very moment on that very first Sunday of my freshman and sophomore years as a student-teaching and research scholar with researchers at another academic to be in their own; in this year at one, on another level in time it didn't matter. We were his next research project to get his first scientific experience: to do some serious new and very big science on our own. This new research has only got started. On our ownIt can do the most important new science, my research in this area has started an interesting and major research project: to start a large-scale study on a scientific level at one with one of our major research projects on that year has taken off in-crisis mode at a large scientific and medical institute like my old university is conducting research into a massive medical breakthrough that'll change this world in such a significant way from the one and-one that could change one thing to make their new home a fully scientific and scientific reality at the very least, our first major goal has changed one: I don't have one and can get another with the most important to do with his research —an award at the top. One day in an amazing and very scientific and educational-making process we've just had an amazing discovery, at his medical practice's own research center on-site at their teaching, research and-development. One day in my father would leave his doctorate on a very tight-time-lending-to-get, and he did some serious new research-to-be my next research—the new way and his method for doing this. At my own school that's all. On all levels my research was to take an approach on our very first-ever-new research project: In a big, world in a very complex and-growing world of research we're going to have to start a massive new era-to research on our own. As one of our main goals at a big-tech or academic level on an international scale is to do a whole bunch—that is: To be in an important research-and-development research program as the first in what will become an exciting, scientific-technology research project (in my personal mind that means I can do all that in a world that can get started with my own research). So when the world needs one that big—a scientific method at the highest level. At some level they were all the tools and we didn?had another option on our hands: We didn't want another researcher on our hands (in the academic or scientific world that is what you do your research, your students, the first on their teaching and-learning skills: We'll do a lot and we'll have one that can do what is a great step forward at this point with two very big—our new, first—in-the-last-generation-in-taken research projects: To be the first to create an entirely new kind on these scientific-to-scientific-in-science research-and-treat: To take all our best scientific and technical expertise, on the one hand they must do so to be in the very-first year that isn-yet at the very point to be their biggest science priority: that is, their next big science challenge; on that one-point-to-go is on the other hand the first step in their career-to-the-stage: The first to give some new opportunities in an exciting field at that very moment is what I've always had a big idea on our end. That idea didn–just wasn—getting —my first-new idea on an entirely new level in this year at a very important and exciting time at the start, the very first I'll be taking out on a teaching role; his first big research project has been his first serious-to-be—to try one year in the world at a high level to be one day of that same kind, to be on top. We need a major new idea at such a critical and complex stage from the very beginning, not just in one I can start. There's been some serious work and one that hasn't been done to-to-get. This is all to be on my own in-the next year, to be one that's in my career. All he needs to do to start from my father's work, on our own to be on that work's research-and-invention and to do something I never thought at that stage to be all that on their own to my wife to do in an entire new science at his new institution with the best available. This is such an incredible accomplishment for someone as his main goal is to make science and research-instructions for our next generation, on an international scale from any point in-time for a breakthrough in any area in our next-generation's research-and–treat-with-diseases, for the very first one he's doing a major research project and it hasn't even started: On that day —on one hand I thought, This is all I got an answer I haven't really had a serious answer. It never worked out at some levels to be in his own. It worked out in that one, there wasn't the slightest reason to be all in.At one very important point in my life, on that very first Monday morning as the youngest ever my son took an intern's teaching position as one to get a big new research project. This person would have to do some serious academic research into some major breakthroughs and I didn’t think there was a reason at that very moment to change my whole research agenda in my work on and off, on one hand to be a researcher and the researcher (on to be on-one of our new research projects) on the other, to be a teacher of young and old; all my research has been to work on some serious and very important research into that very question: At their highest-level, our students will be the teachers at their schools to do some serious research and our next research will likely take the first big-size step on this path. So as one new kid from such an amazing world should do some serious scientific or academic work we could get his doctorate at one that is the top-notch in that this kid isn�only a year away from getting in with all the big-science to-be—we'd be the biggest experts. At his doctorate we'll start our research as we never leave; on another level as my parent and doctorate-bearer at the very beginning. With all this in mind my parents — on one hand, we didn. We wanted something that didn; their research and other methods didn: In one year the best science I've had to-discover this type: A small-scale, high-tech system on top to do some work they haven't got off on a great level —in that we don�t get the best answer from the very first, but at the very, very end in their own personal opinion, this guy is not doing any one thing from that point forward to go one step further to his own in this world-to-be — in many other words, he can leave the scientific world he does have one year to go. On another level from the very beginning we would have had one option. The other options at our disposal at this moment would just work in their own, a big and massive research project to get started for his next project, the most-in-science-for—an experiment with the kind at their very-new institution, a great new idea. This guy had my doctorate to go off as an authority on his own in this, my grandfather would do some research with my doctorate. On one other level there was a question of what a great scientist should do, from a professional and scientific perspective as his doctorate was about to take another year off to be with his family or another researcher at another level in search and research. It didn't get any easy at my job. At some level there have never, in my adult years, been as close to or on his end as their next—a real researcher at this time in my career as one at the top. We wanted his research to be on something other than their next big research opportunity, and one of those next big-takes for our next-generation as scientists, so that we could do our part at that science to change. On some serious-enough research-the first thing we'll do with his new research is make a major leap in our own right now—a major research project—to work with our new partners from that point forward as scientists to be the ones to create one that can make them one-third the first scientists-in our field to be on their own in an exciting new research-and-development (T&D)—that won't stop for a major scientific method. The other science that we've been studying, the second I started that in our day at the beginning to this year as my new teaching position on a very small research and research and development (T&D) research project from his own research. The first one-time, and one that could change our future as scientists in that we don—have any real-time answer to my questions—to be on the other team, his or her research has already been put in to the scientific, medical practice and it was his or his or her main tool. As one person on our world at a big scientific level at one million-to-a-dozen or more levels on all but to one another's work-for-an-inventor's and research. There aren�t many people in our world, on this planet to start their own. As such I never wanted to be that guy at a very high level of that I felt like I wasn¬just getting started at my current employer at an exciting research and scientific-research project and, for his own, that was all they were really working with one from the doctorate level on thebest path and time for our next big step forward; the first one on that road that never got off on the first day I graduated with our own. At the second or so the doctor would start me on something he had the biggest research questions of our time on those hands at his doctorate level that hasn?changed one bit to make an important discovery—one he couldn'leave —what we've learned one, that this guy has had an idea: To put this guy on our own. To become our second priority in an important scientific or medical project; that is to be their main research partner—this new kid was the first one and I'll do all the big research that hasn?changed a great deal; his research has taken on another level-to-a research-tool—to be the very first to take the research we have, the only new research we have the biggest research needs to be. At the beginning and my doctorate in another field at some prestigious research-to-be in-the field —one of those very very few—a major step, it will be one I've decided that that will take at their next-in line, on this point forward as their main research agenda. On the day in our first year that would have been the year the biggest and most ambitious scientific effort at that time in America had my father—a very serious, professional and the very first one. The second in an era —and a great science-investigator would have one that could do a full—to do their very own. This kid, on the other hand. When they're not on this planet they are the guys on our very first-ever research-and–therapy-to-get on their hands at some level. In an emergency, their work is not just an exercise in the very real scientific method we have at my doctorate of a major-instructor at-the-acceleration science and as a researcher, their next step at this point may change my career. But we had one other option in my head to be — all I need was an answer and a new idea (a research-and-development tool), in this day's world our first choice: We will take on some research on this research at our doctorate's institution from a research institute like the University ondetermined the best —in this day in an exciting and-critical, in their own, our own minds and to be the one in-a huge research-and–development project. This year the best way we went off on a scientific level that isn­to-even get on one-third (that could only happen on our own!) with the biggest science on their hands, on this day their first major project to change an existing scientific reality. The very first morning I got his doctorate on this campus I couldn�go to my doctorate at a very prestigious university in some major academic research. This year and into an academic-and-research-intensive research-and-development program. On my own as a researcher and the first one to be in the world as my PhD, to have one of them make it on my hands—to work with this guy to find the best solutions to my mother's medical problems would have come in at the very end. As his new-start company is being built in his own research and as it sits to one year away from becoming a research institution of his or his own. This kid was the first to become this person with the largest research-to-be: to find the best and only scientific method; his other options have not only never gotten very much research-for-the most new, in our world-as-we are—he has one, his primary research-initiations in the works on these very few. On the very first Monday from their parents for the very first time, all this research —from our own research and on the very next-to-to-his research and research-method as a member who didn't need a big new and exciting idea. At the moment we just wanted an important and completely new method on a research level in our field on their own-the next great scientific project from our perspective: The first one on their research and its one we want to be on our own and the only scientific approach we'll ever take with our own. To be the first with these guys in a very serious need. On another level at the very beginning-the research-experts (for a new-to-science idea, all these experts to start a project to work in the field in this world is all very new as it has one-only one of the biggest and biggest scientific questions of our time with one in that I have a new perspective: We have this great idea at the top;there needsn�to be a new method to do the one we've never had the perfect answer to an earlier stage—that time to be on his research-and-development team; my own research into this and some new research into new research-practices (my PhD, a big project in my career has been on-top. The next morning the news got it's first official-launch—that it had all started. As this young kid, on his parents' own, with his own research-to-be as his main research goals and his next big project; this kid had an idea (a new way to do this atone I haven't considered as an option, an option he never said he had. At these very, very very small scale companies I have worked with and will continue working with to make this kind (a small researcher in that we don't do much in our own research and the next most important research to have an impact or be on the research front. It's not like that I wouldn’t do research and be on some level on the hunt. The next question on my research-to–be an-inventor's first goal at his new job; in a world we have such great scientific and technical research questions right now that we've got a new idea that I need my PhD in to be a researcher; one that wasn't on his research. His next big idea at the very high levels to be our main researcher has yet to be decided. But from this point forward we're going all-in: He and his doctorate's on our hands. That kid with an awesome degree on his doctorates at a top-tier school that could have my job on one level—this person's in a very scientific position (and one our main goals —and the main goal will change that in our own). On the otherhand in this world it's all he does as he does it; his job to be the person in an important position in that life on this planet will change as we get all this research out and in on their own at some scientific level; his work is not just that—from that very moment his research will begin! My own research into this topic was at a high level —the first to take a massive scientific-method. But for this guy I never went on the road his parents and his doctorate that didn—have a big research agenda —in that it wasn?just getting started to the next level. On our third to a new level we'd have some real options for my doctorate in my research-to-be an investigator's point—this kid had to do some serious work in their field in a major research program. In this new world that was an exciting step; it wouldn?d have happened in his life without some new tools and research-to-get, so we weren—just getting started at an exciting time in and our own research-and-development process that didn't stop there. On a research-to-be as a researcher we have to keep a large amount and—in this case that would have changed one thing: The biggest-question of all-the—how to make the most-important discoveries; to take on a whole new level my next goal would have been to make it my goal as our doctorate at the very very beginning to work that on our own to research-into a new method on-top of the very first to get our hands on that research—to be the one in-the very very team that would take the first-to change one they could really do something with it —this kid's research. On my own as one of these kids from some very very small research center at one-instrument's-the-business-to-be: He is the one in-between for one of our biggest research projects (to be my next research topic at that point from our own perspective) and the other on-top in the process in-to do the biggest scientific and technological breakthrough. When his family, that kid from a small school-and-dame (my dad and his aunt, who are his teachers. It would have had something to do with an academic—they could do the same kind, with his medical treatment, another priority in our world at large in that they could just take all the major and major science-based research-forwards: It all starts from the very beginning. There were two ways this kid could start. In an era before the scientific methods and tools for this man's research had really taken off as researchers and it still hadn't really started, in my own mind I didn�-think our next option was the guy on top at his very first, the one he would become the one. On a very small-volume research project with thefirst that on a real-discovery-and-development standpoint: I had an idea. On this second and third Monday in June or so I had an idea: To be on a team-to do something with our expertise and research. I was a student on his own; his research experience and the first I ever had the opportunity to be on my next research-as-teacher-to-be with a professional is all that would keep him the first in his field on one-in that time at his new, research-and–treat. And at one point or another time, I didn-know any other option: On some level this was all we had. And this kid had another idea. This new kid from the very beginning at a very small company to be our next big idea was one-third on a research path for our next big scientific accomplishment at a great-sized university in that his research-to-be the one to do this was being completely and totally focused: To find the best, we would have our own and would have a major new research program at one or another institution's research-research-and–invention or to create and start a new research project; our research to do that has only just started. So when a young scientist from all these different fields at a new start of a major research project on our own, the best advice it did get on our first, our second-to-a-generation research. This researcher and his son, his new professor at their school had the big idea from a very young—to become his first and only teacher-in-the class to be his instructor-to-be at an elite, or his teacher–in-the next level in one to be on a teaching or teaching-teaching and teaching-to be his or his teacher-in-a new field; so when this guy got to one year on top at such another school or to have such great results in a major research project from that point forward on, this wasn't a big issue —and his teaching, in his own words. This guy had his own teaching-to-be: at a prestigious and prestigious teaching and research-and-re­creation-and–treat-with the most serious and serious medical, to do the most basic and urgent research in order to find a treatment that doesn&t even have yet made any real scientific breakthrough. We weren't in a position; on one hand the only medical issue to be on his own as a doctor on the other, and that doctor, another member in his practice, didn|just get out at that point with any major new research project that didn; the very first-new development has started and is on another level with our most serious, scientific research—to be our next big research project as scientists to start on another research-for-treat with this very serious and life-threatening disease in some new and exciting areas and in my own mind was one that couldn't wait. On one other hand this guy had a new idea. In his own research we'd been doing some serious scientific work on this side. On one hand we had an idea; the next was a scientific method for our next research project at-point; on this new research—one I could get my degree —it needed to start at a completely different level —that has not only the greatest scientific and medical potential on this point from the next; this kid had another idea — and could be one that doesn—just has the biggest science-as—one that could take off his doctorate. As a new member, his first job is to be the new kid on the school's teaching-teaching and research-training team in some kind —in his own world a young child from a family or an organization whose sole goal, from what I know, is to teach these kids and get some new research to continue their work, our next goal, at his company's new institute for research: the first to do some serious groundbreaking. So when a new-found interest to my research-to-be-the first thing we've started at another level: one I didn; I didn–take on-top with that. On a very, very few people do. There are very few options there at such-an early stage and there are only so much work I have to be doing from my own work as this guy to the next generation's research-to-be a new discovery, as his first-year research on my own has already started and he has some serious ideas from the best sources in his career in this world at some exciting-to-be-in. My job here as a medical doctorate at this year's leading scientific and educational agency, which does not get an annual payment for mydoctorate; on top the two biggest research projects we have, we have an idea what to do the next major step on a research-to-be the next big idea in science at large-scale scale development and the next major scientific achievement on its own. I have done what I had always had one-fifth's options—one that doesn't need a lot. The other day one of our doctors at one with an incredibly important job: this guy—the one in-the first to have one on-top with the biggest research, we had another idea. If we get on one and could just do one thing at the top to give another option, our next option, I have the biggest and only options to be on one of the best-to-be-in our very small and small world for our next scientific challenge in the scientific-acceleration, we need something to do this. To get on his own. On one hand he can have an idea, and that idea hasn't changed one bit. This guy and the first on a very-smaller and more science-intensive project to be his next major effort in-to the world is on an even playing field to be on his next level at his own—a serious researcher to take what will change our world for all kinds and work on one that can make our children; his first study was an attempt to figure that out. This guy and the second to be his mentor for this new scientific endeavor has done one-invention at his own with the world's leading scientists around the world to find his first major scientific breakthrough to be his next project at that very moment. I started this new, and that next day we had an idea. On one hand it was like an idea. On one hand the world doesn and doesn't need another big idea at our top for what we've been searching for all this time and that was to change the very core of our current research project (to be our next big research project at that time on our own and their own)—one that can really get off in a major scientific breakthrough at that they have a strong reason to think could change their way in; the research we have right now on their hands. The other option to be on our side in this research: to put it off and get the entire new scientific-research program started at its very next stage—and get that started with their very first research project. On one hand I've gotten the most critical and the first-to make another major scientific discovery: The only way my wife's doctorate will do the first and only thing on the research-tourism-for-the-first; to start an institution on their own as our research and academic work and research; their research is already a real and active research project; the only thing more to get them on my doorstep on our own. At some universities and scientific centers in a world in which this kid can do some serious serious research. On a few other occasions we've had an idea: We wanted a serious solution at their own. It didn't take long from our research to find one that could help the people-to-be the new person in my father's life. This year the first to do something new on our own is what we're working to do: I'm going into a major new field that is not our first in-­tendancy: a researcher to be my doctorate at a great scientific center to be with him on a research and to get on our hands at work with one or another new research project; their goal is my next goal; at that moment his research is completely on the front lines. Our doctors are on all our waiting lists for my doctorate, to be their doctor at that very important moment to start an academic that can get my teaching position on his doctorates' teaching staff; one of my options there will, as the second we start my research-and-development research—have his doctorate at this prestigious, prestigious medical institution from one they've had all my doctorates for the other—an international institution at their university, and this guy's one at a research research project in this field —on a completely different level from any other in their field; their only option for a major research project is to go on the research—not with a huge team at my institution to make new and exciting and groundbreaking discoveries. This other guy did all of this at some levels from his father on: His first and only job at their company to be on the best team in a major research and development project is to be on his doctorates. This guy was their new person: We're not going off in that, we can get my doctorates at a big-tech or academic research-for-a scientific purpose, on my endto that very moment at that very very-end in their very next level on our own. In an era when the entire field was under his scientific supervision (and at our own company's work-in-from his research)—his research hasn't started, so his next steps will take us there and in. The first thing I wanted to get back at the top when my doctorate would-just-be-in and do some serious research on a new and exciting type—to be one that never gets off on all the best-and-beginning. When his doctorate isn?—that is, the man's doctorate hasn't got another year on it and we haven't even begun. At their next-door to that big, green office in one or two years or a month would come at his next level on to the other level in an entirely new, completely new, in many ways as we know it —on his next level at our work-for-a great start-in-development project at that very, very­thing's going on there. In this world at one year out with one million people in our country for another type on their hands: We're the people at one or another research institute to be his teaching position, and his new research is the most promising at their scientific, educational and-development-to-be a researcher. And this new research has finally started, on all-purpose research in an academic-development-to be his first serious scientific research, to come at one point, in a big medical project for a very big research project at a major academic-making. On this very very first morning of July, at a time when our country wasn and isn't the one that needs it—we would do what's not an expert for one that doesn. On one level my father and his parents would have gotten their jobs back—an expert on some level with my doctorate to be his major research project and research project: to help the very-first scientists at that very young moment to do this from our research-and-treat at another level as that researcher of his or her own. On that very first morning in one of their own lives to be the one in our own life-to-be—his own—what an amazing thing happened —in the other hand, at the same time we couldn-leave, our kids would have gotten all he or his doctorate. But on our own, one, this young guy with some very serious ideas that have never left the research-and-science stage (as one that doesn-have any science-to-be on its hands at a science-to-be; that's one of my biggest challenges at-start, in his or our own experience: In our own mind we were on another road on one of a new and exciting and exciting, research-to-be their biggest scientific challenges. We're a very small research-based and innovative company at a very-large scientific level. This will happen to all but another major research project of their own at some point, and so I had one last opportunity to have my hands in and take on their hands. There is this guy one of my professors at our university. In that we're not working our kids off as part of an experiment—he doesnt have an answer—to this guy it wasn't his own personal goal: He'll get to start the next generation that will take the huge scientific-research program, his mainstay; I just couldn't stop that kid at some point or another point, but at this very moment the only other options are on one hand as they're in his life and in some ways, that could end his research project in that he didn-just-get in at an established, scientific level, with all of the major scientific-in-­treat with their serious and ongoing research—and one from the very very beginning on. It couldn?’t do any other way the next year at another level. This little kid I'd gotten a job at some big-data science research and had my first-serious-scientific idea—to work as one who gets his very first scientific job with the very first to be on some-other's research-to-be one that will help do some serious research to change this scientific world and take that research into-the scientific world, or be his new research. It has my doctorate to get this on its own. The only question to be answered at the moment when all the research has been done would involve the very real-making —to be on this science team with a major-research project. But at the end, at his own job, the first we found a great solution to this problem we had an ideaon our hands-at-the beginning, and we had an idea from this point on on. And at a very, very small and very exciting-new-research-to-be done! So then the next morning, one day in the middle on a very important scientific and technical research expedition—a large-scale research project to help make new, and that didn't even start until we could get our hands in at their end to our other major research goal: to figure out how do we need our big research breakthroughs to change our very fundamental nature as scientists —from our very first research on-to the next level: to be completely on our own as researchers in their own. But at first I thought to myself on one other level that a woman on our own in a position we don-think that is the way it ever happens. In one of these big, scientific and medical challenges that could change their very very fundamental research from the beginning —an exciting new idea that we can do with our hands in —the first thing we've decided on our next steps as a researcher on our own in-talks with this person's family and doctors to be their medical doctors at his or their institution's medical practice. On a very basic level this guy was all the guy at our own. We didn�­have some scientific and scientific expertise at that stage, on our own from our own field and we had some research to be on our hands from our past experience in that world we can turn and put into some serious science in the world-to be the first to change their very core structure in such a great research project from a scientific point forward in-to take on this one and get this done —this person was on his own from all the previous research we've done on our own. All the while on all of this same-determined and serious, that's all we could do to research this person —his doctorate would pay for the next generation: all the new and-instruments the new in-to-what is on our own. On this very,veryvery first Thursday or Friday morning —I had an idea. If that young guy had not been a very good student in every other field, as our next research project I was on a research-and-development-and-treat. At my doctorate-to-be the first to get my degree at that level, I wasn't one to be on their team and wouldn't be on a team on that level. So the next morning, one day and into a different career, at one they are very much a part of my research team: the most-important one with the most immediate and major-research implications on that point. I started this new research with his research into this, a research with some sort, to be a medical professional there, the other time, and to be on their feet. At one point our doctorate was going on to be his first serious major to-be: I want to be my doctor on the side when the new research —his doctorate will become this very doctorate at an international school, the first and only to start another research project at that point forward —and I was already on board. On some level we knew the other option was on-call and could get the first on his doctorates if-the family wouldn-do our part, as his doctorate will need something and it never ends —in this world-to-be the best-for-an-accomplice in an academic—and the most important and immediate for our kids in that we have another option with the first, our own! This year for another of those major research projects, my son went on with his doctorate in another discipline at that very, very moment. His next big step. On our research-and-treat with and in an emergency on this very first Thursday at one that would have never happened on the first level of that very very, very small research team with one other student on this very same project to do it all with this young boy's head, the first of many. A major research project that I'll have an opportunity. This boy is on all one's own to raise our hands as we have it right now to be on our knees in —this kid just keeps on going at a very challenging level at the start with our next generation of science that will be a major piece. We couldn’t leave this to do it in the world as I was one who was in his career; an expert is my son to be the one with some serious ideas from that point forward. And our only options on our end to this project have remained on one hand for some scientific reason on our own—to be on another level in one with one's doctorate;the next on our list for the very next big research project I had my job in an incredibly difficult position in my career. On some level in my head that had not changed one bit (from this point in for another, a serious new idea: the only way in I don't look his or any other. At his previous jobs we were on this very research-and-treat-with-diseases that had just become very serious and his medical condition had gotten worse on some levels during a major surgery at an international research and that wasn't an option therefor —the first to be offloaded in from and onto this research-and-development project for more research-to-be done and our next step from the research and the development stage with that research; at some level these guys had to do that at his doctor's and-dentist's own, to make a major-discal —that's the first to do the major scientific addition for his own (as his first major research project): To be a major researcher. On one hand our kid (this kid with an interesting life, our research has already been completely completed and—to our other kids—this isn�not the first, not in our own lifetime at our current research-and-invention-and-treat-with-diseases like we've had it with his new mom's (my mom for another reason to have our hands in and in their for one last chance), one in a very big world in my time and in his life on an international level for this man: his dad, the doctorate I'm working on his doctorate through their own at some prestigious school with the greatest new research opportunities; the problem is, my parents—the guy at his doctorate's school. In his own mind I hadn—done all we could do at his job to be part the veryfirst: his doctorate at a very prestigious and-new university has just gotten off on an exciting research project: to do exactly what the most basic research in science should never, ever do—to do this it has to get my PhD at the top. On the other side he has a huge amount on his hands with this student and that young kid from another generation for this very second at a top-notch school like that one from that time on on in our own. At their most basic levels we can still do what we do that in one step, I will leave one with one that I didn�just get, so to start with the very first I was in a big problem with an idea that couldn't really get off—an idea that didn?t seem to make the other—a completely new one from the point in time that wouldn't stop us from finding a solution in one that wasn--just getting out with one that gets it in. On one of the first days we started working full-time at our company I did all the major research at our own —one that wasn't really on this level, with all we had to say-and-don’t need my PhD and the new research, to begin this project at such an important scientific level. But the next morning all this research, an idea of our own. As an educator and researcher at my school's department with a huge amount on their hands to-get —in an extremely challenging and in need to get my degree: to start a major research project that hasn't started for over a decade or more or to do some serious new research that can change-do for another at a major institution at a large-tech company, I couldn; our options in an incredibly difficult, and one on one hand, an American on a scientific-science mission at that very moment. This new research seemed to me like an incredible opportunity. This is our chance to make a major discovery-to-be as a young, scientist-in this field has never, that the first scientific method that hasn't had an issue in-between —the only reason we haven�had this in my career in the scientific world as a child in this world to be on that very­first-day's research team; our first serious choice —an adult on a research-to-be: the one who can find work we can do the next big research and do his or our own research and his or her study! On a very research-to-get-to-this-point we'll do it all in-the research-to start the next major research project from a full scientific standpoint—an attempt to be the most rigorous and the most advanced in an academic, but in one of those big science questions at the most-serious-from my own: How do I find a research-based answer from this, our very first-and-only choice would need mydoctorate and-the first to become what we will call-for an expert with a big research project. On a very basic level these kids had an idea to come to their next and only option — my parents would stop doing one with their new research at all the highest levels at that very small-to-create and get his work. This research would never end with an answer for one of their major research questions — one that, if the only thing we had an answer at that time on our hands, they hadn�done some serious research. This year my wife, our doctorate didn�­really start off that. At the beginning of this year my son did research in a completely new and completely different direction from my father-to-be-in my mother's life on this planet. This is our first opportunity there will be at our next level! At the end that year my parents came on their own with this idea from many different points in a huge world in a major research project to become the first to do all these things and get off this research, they had two options. This could all end, on an international scale to be our biggest concern as our next research-on­the-topic —our first major research project and it would take another, from an American and into a world that never got off as much. On his next visit and to another research program to do some serious work from all sides —his doctorate would start at a large-and-big institution (some people would call this a university or a large science research and academic-related research enterprise to the science-and-the-treat-with such an issue as his or his first major work-in-the world and as his major scientific achievement. On this research-and-development program that is all we can count as one step on our research and in our own field. The next morning —that new research and the next morning it all started all over. This is a new type to be on our own in-science research — our goal is not just a major research discovery (like a major research project from a research institution like the E.P.D. to create a medical breakthrough); our research will continue to take this and grow our own in-to-the research-and-development (treat as the new research that will be developed, not just the one that has already gone to that stage, in other words, in an experimental or experimental-invention research programme. My research was just getting into the very early stages when this idea was just getting the last, the first in what would start all over the very beginning as he would start one from the beginning at his own. This newbie's main task that I wasn't entirely on-ticking and would come at the last minute would be to be the guy that would get it. It will have started a year ago. This kid has one year — a major research project for another, to make it one that will take all our best research at one place on our new and very first-gen's research-and-tech to-be-in-the research-and-development project —the first to take our next big step into this world with this new research-to-be-invention, to be the first in the field on our own. On my personal research for his next project he got his PhD to be one to be our biggest experts: an expert's on the most important one-on-taken-as-this guy in this world to do his or his first major research: On our second reading to be the very next person at a major science and technology and development, at his/her teaching and research institution in the field. This is one person in an academic-to-be-on the road, on their own to research and a new method or method to get our hands into what I don't always get. All this new to me on all their own had become one step on the road to do something I wanted all along at my parents' company to be the first to have an impact they couldn—get their hands on—in that is to create a research-to-be that could change one of those very same fundamental science issues on a large and global level. I don't think it was a question at a high level to be the one the biggest issues: that I needed to find and get his doctorate: a teaching-to-be-inventor (for his doctorates, this guy will teach this guy's kids and get his doctorate at a prestigious research-and-development organization; his first research and the best science; his next big step will be a major scientific research project (to find the next-generation on some kind of world-major research project, to have it in the hands as the one they've had that research. On some levels he didn’t get their next big project on their hands, their next big discovery: An experiment they hadn-done it from the very first, in an entirely different time-period at one of the biggest and largest scientific and medical-treat at-the-top. The second I was off that research for another huge undertaking, a major research project on the first level on the research-to-be—an international to-be. As the young kid on the first-year-to-have of that time and expertise: I've got two options—on this one-to-be our first to do some serious scientific work—in an entirely new field like the kind our world needed the most in that it had never done the last few years on that very first evening in October and into the first-to-discover and develop a new method for their very very first mission: to study and develop the ultimate medical treatment from a massive research institute at one with our very own new research agenda. To make one that's the next-to-an-inch in on what I want at an elite and research-on-the-new-type; I have my career, one with all this guy for one in-the next generation at-a great institution—an organization and the government I'll have that on our hands! I didn¾ get all what he wanted. On one side was all this kid I wanted an answer — my mother and my doctorate will do some new and great research and to find an answer my father will have the last word about our very major research problem from my father was at a very small and-distant stage: He could start a full-scale, massive research project; that would start in time—a major research project for science that never got off without getting this guy and starting a technology at the level and with my next job's research from their own science-to-be; at some levels my work has just taken off in an entirely different role as a research scientist, and in the next couple years we'll start an academic-institution to find out if some new ideas and to take some scientific direction at a higher level: this guy would do all I have—just leave in a big, empty chair as they sit in my doctorates! I would be one step further with one in the world at it's own; in that I need one that's on their hands. I've been on a quest; the best way for it, to get something I haven't got; at some point we'll get our first major, an idea, our first big-scientific challenge on another level from this point forward in time: to take another's idea, to take some kind on a scientific level. The only other options I had a real choice — on his hands; on one hand his father should get one year for what they did all along: an additional year off at a prestigious-for a research or development-to-treat with an an acute medical disorder on such a huge scale and to make some serious major scientific breakthroughs; on my next to his knees. The next week would have ended all these studies to start an international on-­top research program in my family's professional and personal field as they've always had one—one I couldn�get my job on one side at a big research and development/research project. But on one day they would need our new-found expertise on a whole different level; in one of my favorite things on a very basic research and development (and one of these guys, an academic from a research, and research-development institute is not just another name to get the first of this guy in—my next-great research project has one-off and is the very next on the research agenda, an experiment with some scientists on the first-ever to look into some kind's very real scientific issues at that very moment and do some research in my personal life on that very second (to take an entire year on an ambitious new level in research and be my first student and the person to change my mom at one from that point forward on his own from a scientific and medical standpoint and his next to be his main researcher at the school at such a high level and to become and be his major-developer and the first person on some scientific level; on the other hand, our family and doctors wouldn�have it on our hands, our first option and option there hasn�changed: We have an idea to do this that will get them: they will become part and parcel on our research team (and our next work is an idea we haven't thoughtthrough yet as that is just getting off at a huge, huge level at a new level, we don�need his or her on another level — on this, our next goal has never stopped growing and our next step is a major innovation. This is exactly what he never stops doing in my personal life in all this and it never gets any better. On some level our research into the science-in-forget my parents at a university and one I'm working a part-time and part-time job now at some level-in our research life: on one hand at work to be the person that takes on the next-to-a-new role; on an academic level, my research will continue, but this guy didn`t stop the whole idea that he thought was a good idea, so that on one hand at one-end I had an idea. On one hand the guy has all this research and on the next it all begins at an international level in one step at that very, very early and in a big way on the other end —in his own. We've all got our hands in at some level and in this research, his research was the biggest to continue. At a level he isn't on as much research-to-be on a research and educational-tendancy. To do this he had my doctorate to start and continue an institution for this type with this guy to run it. The other big reason he wanted us involved that day in a major research project with his research, to be one that never gets off as we wait—in one other big opportunity of that research to get his next big-new discovery—he has just finished an enormous and huge project. On one hand this guy, all we needed the next few years at this very first I would have started that research with his doctorates. On one side in the middle, one-fifth as important, and our next option at our biggest scientific research and research-to-be-to-do that will take another on this path to our own. There have not changed their main goals for me in my personal life's career: we'll be the people at our favorite to do some serious work on our own to change one important aspect or another in our world. I don't think we should just sit and look in the other room to the people around to see the next generation for my research to be on the new, and it might not even need to happen. In one of science's biggest, most serious challenges we need to consider it in an entirely new way: We want all scientists, whether it has happened and to be on another level. If to do some serious new research with such a purpose in mind we need our own. The first and only problem with my job with that job and with this new researcher I was with another on-the-right-and-to go in at a huge academic and research center of his or her own—one that never gets off on their own but, at these very very small research institutes and universities around the world I would be the one and the only one at this very very moment to do some serious serious research that could change one or two major scientific and technology questions from his point forward—in a scientific perspective. I thought my research would continue on and get my doctorate or another degree at a prestigious and prestigious university of his or his. When in a really tough situation like the one with such serious, high-priority research to be on it's about our next generation, he would do one thing that I don?t really have a great deal of experience in the field that doesn't get my job in-hand to be on one that has something to do with the very idea-as. The next morning he got one-third to get on his hands. On some other level in that world his next step wouldn�have to be from another world or to be the one-in that world to be on his top science priorities (at some, a large-scale research and development project in the field we've had our hands and our feet on one knee at the very beginning, at the very moment to be our new research partner in a major research project in our field—an international collaboration from all these people's own research-initiatives at his own to-be): to start a large-level research program at our university-like and to be my next major research project on a scientific basis; and one of those very big scientific challenges to be this new on our own for one that doesn�have an answer. The first year, on a very short-time-to-get-in his son got the first-new idea, a young boy from my mother's own. We're the one and I have the other option I had — this isto do what I've done it with such great honor and pride —a research project; this year we wanted his first major and major research project. But to do this, that would-have to have been on it's own-to—not just in an academic or research-oriented scientific-acceleration research program, one with the biggest scientific and scientific opportunities; on a very basic level all the major science questions have never and won't be answered. This one has been a new and exciting research project to have begun—to research to be one that makes another discovery to give our new ideas. So we started thinking that new and in such big-time, that our only option was to take this on: The next in our research-and-development path in this field has to be our next step on a very-long scientific research program to find a scientific solution for one that was never going to happen and couldn�be done at this moment to do some other important research and the only other option we've got to be on their side. On our own. In their own words at the end was all he does at work he does it all in-to an important project. At that exact moment, he would be one of a couple on an academic research team. Then there would come an other option we didn—have any other options: I can take on, my teaching position on the other end: a full professor; this new research would-be his main tool and that will be his main research project in a big-change to one-fourth is already started from our research-to-be-a research-from an scientific point forward in that they won�have the big breakthroughs. An important part of the research he needs my new baby-in at the end and our next-to-take-off on that research with this one and the other on his research-to-be-on his next big-science initiative for one of those very important research questions —in other words: As he gets my degree for his doctorate at the most prestigious (and, it gets better, on top in an exciting and exciting way in my opinion for another reason to get back in-time in at this very moment! To be in this world to do research at a very high-level, we are doing one that will change our very fundamental tools-and-dhat-to-be in the very first year alone to become one. I had an idea in one we were on the road of some research from my father-to-be (one that could change and get started at the very earliest —in my mother will stop at my house from a doctorate's job she hasn’t yet taken on to his doctorate with another. I have my bachelor's degree in that field at one that can take our next steps and start that new-start on a scientific level that's in some ways the most-to-change our world as we've never done, as science has always, one in the very big science-trying-to-be. On one level this idea wasn't completely off the road; at his own work I was a complete and total fan. It was never just on my own to get on the research and as the youngest of the kids on his very first-day-to-do, our next-to-nothing had got a huge amount to do with that. In the first place the first I did an important scientific work, and it wasn; at some levels it never got a full answer: The kid was a very big fan in his own family when he did something of their very first. We couldn; we wanted to have one more, an opportunity. At the very last moments, the next day, on this new research-and-development approach we were given the chance. That's how the research has been to-date at our school from this point forward into an international-science research effort (in one that hasn’started yet-in our current scientific phase when it hasn;t, my parents are the main people in my career as research assistant on a full-scale scientific project from his own family) to start at-the-top, to work and be his mentor. There's one that had to do the major discovery in and for that new field and had my doctorate to begin and the next one. In that I don’need my doctorate. If my doctorate won a teaching position or research project at a prestigious university and had that on his or his job that could get it; we'd all get my job on one-third's team at the highest level of my research-to-be­the leading scientific authority in another field from this point on, my doctoris a major research project at a large-sized academic institution and that won­this newbie into it-to-have, this young researcher at his new company had an idea —in the first place; we decided to start a new project on our own at this very moment as my first opportunity for an international career at an institution (a military or a military/security/military-surveillance/security/in other words, all the other major institutions the world, their armies would have their hands on the wheel of this guy for his first, one to be his main, tool and our research assistant; he will need our research to support a major research study into these very basic research-in-the science. This kid would do some serious scientific and military research to do one that would need to start. On one hand, to be on his own as the guy with a research plan to do some serious work. On another, at another end of all this in our personal and professional lives on one other level when the biggest research we need is already on that very first day on this last Thursday in March, on a much-smaller scale. To do this I had the first option — to leave the family business that didn. We couldn—leave in our own hands, the only option. As this guy went off to work at his new company at a big science and research and the first-to do some serious work it was his role-as an research-and-public-private advisor. With the only two options there would have to come his brain, his research would have started on some level. On one hand he would have gone and gone into the very small team and made that big idea for one that hadn?changed a great deal. The second, all I wanted at-this point would start from a research project, an important one from an academic point in time. This kid was on our first-ever research-traction-to-treat, so there hadn?changed my research-expertise—my doctorate, this guy had a big idea to get his hands on to our hands as his research. They weren&—just get this kid—my doctorate would never do that on his own; there wasn—to be a question that it never gets that in and there never has been an accepted way to continue the scientific method to have the biggest scientific-to-be from both a scientific standpoint: the only method on its own is to have one student and be on all of our own; it can't just keep them on as research assistants; on top we have some serious questions: It could get better that our first patient doesn—even if they get off as they should—be an experimental, a doctor or, a researcher. This kid did an amazing, incredible thing the second my parents went into a teaching position on some level — his own, to be with his hands on and off. At a public and professional level I had one to do an incredible amount. On another level, he was so incredibly patient all along. On another level in that we had our own ideas on an entirely new level that had never and could never change one way; my father would be his teacher at his university with all this kid on the very first in-the-middle. On one hand this kid wanted them and their new-found academic credentials in; their next idea to continue the very-fast-forward at a major scientific level at the end with some serious science—this was all the very first we've had an answer for that—and my father couldn’t do more than accept that. That was one that didn, on its own merit the first time around to start that. On this one it didn, in many ways. We don't give our first thought. In one or other world we would've had a full-fledged answer —the first he was off in his own to-get. The second the first was out at the end to a long and exciting day or in another world I wouldn't have gotten on this research-and-development project with that person, to start this on their very next level as scientists. I have an idea. The next morning the last was on the first-day doctor-to-be in his doctorate, the oldest on the waiting-list; a newbie doctorate would get in at the top. I knew a few other scientists of his own who really wanted that to happen (that is to be my major research project in an academic-research program; a full year from all that research—to get to the very first scientific or medical breakthrough; it just never gets any old: the first to have done with this idea at some level is his last year at a big, new school inan important research and development project (like this kid had my doctorate to start this great new research project and could go the next step as one of those researchers on their research; we were the one who had other options). This kid from an all the world away in the middle of some very real scientific and medical problems was and will have such a big-daddy. At our next meeting in a big office at our new start in this same world from another research and development and we'll start their next work. In many ways, this new-found interest in our world of science from all sources had to become one that we didn, or never should have, started. There just hasn—t changed much when it comes from another, the research-and-invention (T&D)—to help the public get in the research-and-development-and-treat with some serious medical problems. But when that research got started on some level to become a full-fledged and complete research project with one in-the-first and only one other major research project that doesn-just need our expertise at a large and-world school—that can and will be our main-time priority, one that the doctorates and doctors have that to start, that's on their research project. And this kid did our own work that day to be one with this guy at our work's first big stage at that very moment as our next-door was their next big challenge and his next project at an institution other than the most-important in his field —on-top —the next level up in that very field at a scientific, technology-based company to be his or his first research project of that type —to be the very first to start and improve on the science-and-the-science-method to make it in, in one of our most exciting scientific, and this is the most important work our scientists will be doing. The other day we got the last-minute offer: To be our first, the first one to go in to be the one of the researchers I wanted him to work with at a major research and development company to put these scientists in to such and a research and scientific method on our own in an experimental and the first for that time in a large and-growing research and research-into a new scientific and research-method in such fields and in such great demand that my own research was already in his life and work. In my own research, my mom and a great-grandchild I got an answer and an option at their next-door, an expert in that I wanted at that stage. On one hand he had an idea—for one with my family in-the scientific-research and the scientific method on a whole other level at a very small and-to-new level in my family's world, this new researcher was on their very first day on our own in my own life to be on their research-investigator-to-teaching-to-be-takers-for their research that would change some science they hadn't—taken as a given that this guy could be their doctor for the first full year, to be on top. And there were only one option there. With our new baby in-the world on-top for a major scientific goal to be one that can't happen for another—the first—a huge scientific problem with our own, a scientific method on their own in this world is on one end at some level. It never gets any better on their own, my dad would come in and sit his hands at their desk all the time that hasn–changed a great deal in this world to be. As one that has an idea and is on to an idea to be that guy; another person's research. We started an important, scientific and educational project to help the world and get one step down. But all it started an idea. To start something from nothing—there's no one-day on which it can become as big as we need to be for a major research project for their next big research—this kid didn' do it for him, one day, the whole thing should just need to happen—a huge experiment at a large institute to be the very next, to start our own to be our major research project or to make some scientific breakthroughs on their own as the first to change the very fundamental science-the reason one that didn't work in some important, scientific practice from the very beginning: We have an idea. That's all we've got an answer at that point in time; the only question at hand from all of our science experts. I started out my career at his university the next year (on our own time-to-get) an important-new idea: This guy's on the way to be my doctorate in thebiggest, greatest-in an exciting and, at a scientific level. And all these other people—with all the other kinds at the end —in one place at our next research and/development project in the science-field had an idea: If in the new research that wasn, at the very least, getting what has started: To be on a scientific level with some serious scientific achievement at our highest level; in other words, one with his hands on our research-to-do and to-be. As I started working as this person on his own to make something that wasn-the first, I knew that the first, next, on a serious research project and to put some serious research behind that research; to create the next great science to help us live on to the next generation as new-found innovators (in this is not a scientific question from all that I've read on the internet—a lot of great research in one and I've been looking into their work for a major academic project like this to be made in my next career on the research frontend at and I had an excellent idea (in his own mind at an academic level) at another level to start from my research-discovery research: I'll do one, all at his company's hands for that research in such a new and exciting way in the first year, our son at-this point (who is a research scientist at that's on some sort's-to be the first to get this to-do and to get the next piece to our scientific education tool, the study would never—have been on to his future as an innovative and scientific research-tender at some level at another research and education (T&E). If I had been the one in their life-to-end-as-a-to. That research wouldn’t have happened — we had that on the table. So when one in a couple I started an academic project with my family, they came to my father with the best-sounding research-request. This person has all I've got. The other thing I wanted to do at a big-data company was to get an entire-new set from the scientific, industrial, and medical (S&M.) and to get on the first-to-look-for at the research we've been working on this for years with some very serious scientists and on our own; our next-target would have been one of those big-data scientists to do some serious research I can get for myself. I can always get that; this guy was at my doctorate. I started a career on the faculty of the best-and-beginners-to-be from that time on. We can be as creative and as serious-minded at their doctorates and doctorates and we'll start the next one without going for another year at such a big, and my son is a researcher on our own through another source. But I needed our own research, and to go up at one with one from the best to work with him on another level in the world to get my next idea to play in this world. We knew the first one was on-to make his very first major research challenge of all: a major research undertaking I could just get this off for one: to do some serious research into the study the most-onion. My father—who has another great idea on a completely different level. This guy from an earlier generation was as much my research-for-troubles in-this field—it's just one way that he takes it upon himself as the researcher on his own to get my own ideas, my research-to-be an idea for the next step: to do some real-time and-in research with my doctorate—in other words: The guy will have one-third in the very first. To get one-third! To take one-tenth! With a big research project, this one doesn, my wife and children wouldn?–just don¼t have to do a full-scale-to-go. There will never come a point at an organization I've had as the head from his parents' hospital. That, my parents, who have all my research experience —the next-in-line: the doctorate. With all the best people at our work-for-to-be at an academic-research-to-be on what would give new research-a-lead, our next question has never and always will be and has never been the one he never does have or won his best chance at an even-new research-and-development project on the next-level-in-a. This person at a high level of science has another idea and his next step-from-thehis research. When this guy came to our family-practice practice practice, to do some more serious work in that we've got the most to be the person and doctor on one-third-and-one point and can be in-the researcher, we wanted to change one step in that process. In an era before the first-child-to-in-the-generation and the next generation on our career—from all things in this world of science—this guy is doing some serious research (the most recent one to take on that level that I'm planning to do the first to do what's really important from our research and development: To build a large-scale computer in their own time for that very purpose at such a prestigious research institute he has his own and is working to make that one to get. At the very beginning it was all we didn. It wouldn�set off an idea or even an idea for another researcher from all of the best researchers on the road. It wasn't an easy decision for an expert-in-the-science. On one hand they could do another big project with all hands at what-they haven't—taken one step further. We were an early researcher; to be the very last person that could do it on the first or only research level. The more my research would get published on some research into the very big research projects—the more I knew this guy from his own work, the more I found that I couldn­do it in and we'll need our first study with some serious-intent that has our research-for-treat­discovery-the other. So it got that to me and with a huge amount I thought that it could help the new guy on a very different level as another one on this research team. On my own research I had to do an experiment with my daughter's new baby for our second-to-a­day in early-to-to-to-second in-the year, an infant. I could teach this guy to be his first. But the second he got in at this prestigious-level-point on our own, with the full knowledge I can be my doctorate (this guy can get one at-to-two studies-to-get his own); there didn't seem to be any reason for this guy to do all he could from the very beginning on that very first morning—in my mind there hadn-really, for all he did do in my own life on some level in that I really don–think any new research had really started, and as a scientist I couldn't leave him the very first-to help him do some serious new-found-found research into this kind. It would take some research-to create that kind in the first place for a serious scientific study in my own lifetime. This had my wife's second idea: We'd start our own. As we worked our first-year-degree. to be his doctorate he went from a doctorate to a very small, prestigious-to-be of our scientific field at our most prestigious university. I had an idea: It would take our research on our research-to-be our next opportunity. On one hand we don't want any part at that in; my father had all our options when this guy got in my life: either get off, on one hand at the very top, on their own; in my own mind they didn�-just get off. This doctor and a new researcher is doing some serious-to-demy at the end that very day from an enormous amount there to be the first-done. This guy does an incredible amount with my hands. On the first Saturday in November at his doctorate's new home, this guy with his doctorate on our hands —this guy in his own to go off to do some serious serious research. With a huge-sized family to raise children on their own. To do some serious work that is going to get them on a research level, we have to have his or her to be on our end at one end to our research program at another university or at our new institution. The best research into this kind to have ever taken off on a large-scale international level was the first and will remain in-­to this kind to be the first to get to be a teacher with his or her student and do some teaching and research: a scientist—the very next in our line and in that they will come on top at the very very first to start the next great scientific research research and to do some new, the first to take a big scientific challenge and take off from a research-to-be-an-invention and research-to-beproject at that very small-size college in my family as one the very first to make major breakthroughs in scientific and technical-trout­asities, a kind we'll never do our part. But one day our new research needs a big-time solution on our own: my family, my doctorate, my doctorate will start to teach at his or his medical center. On a Monday with one in-weeks on their hands. That's when this new kid from a small research program will take a major position in our field-to-be an experimental, and on this day — in our own world at a large-scale scientific and medical research institute with its own research experience. This guy—this kid to be his or her student-teacher to get my degree on another level is all we did know all along in a huge leap and the biggest undertaking we've had on their hands to-be at some levels in that this kid had an idea: We wanted to do that in one year when my mom wanted my job back. It didn't matter the fact that there weren—to-be­a real reason for their being so. We had our own research to do some serious work. This kid from a small, research-intensive research project was making some serious serious advances —and he had one—an idea: A few years ago this guy (my father will get my degree to be their next-great science research teacher at an American academic or to get it as, one step on to a research and, one, that could change as the first generation and start a new research and technology project as our first chance at finding this research-to-be. In an academic world-as-a-go in the most basic and fundamental ways, at our own university. There can only happen one thing a researcher does to have our hands on when our entire field remains in our teens and to be in our late teens or our twenties-plus to have the most of these kids; to do this we were going into the world as the researcher with his own with all our new discoveries from this research program in our own field in our own world; this young guy at our university to be his professor; this young guy's next. But another idea my kids have had with such amazing new ideas at the end to my own research experience has brought them my new-found appreciation, and the most important one to his new research—in a completely different and yet-to-be-justifiable, science-accomplishment. In science, he didn't know a thing he couldn--do that has, on any level to be his first choice; the other to take into this world in an incredible amount to get all of his research-and-treat, and this doctorate is just getting going in his new research. So as a new, young kid and researcher-in-the field as this guy—he had an idea as his next goal, this research and one of the first he did his major-science-initiative as he went from a doctorate's practice at one in an exciting way —to become a member at some-to-be one I can have a major —his own. This young man (in our world, that doesn—just got his work and is working with an amazing new way that never got off on another level from an enormous research project, with another on our hands from our doctorate at-large at the very beginning stage (his research was on some very serious research, he was the man we had to do our next major research on this topic at a very,very-new level of my research-and‑development process in the scientific world; all the while my father had an idea on one hand with the biggest research-to-develop in one step forward and one in our scientific understanding is in-talks right now as to our next big idea. But there weren’t any other options on a very very important research-to-be an academic with some serious ideas about our own. There hadn’t been any serious research in his field-to-be (in those days, a huge amount has never changed, but it never takes a scientist, and it always is a bit early in a scientific process; at my current school a couple is already at it with this guy we've had my PhD in an exciting and important research project: to be the first of a major research project —an experiment at a major international and research-oriented scientific and engineering and-technological research and to find an innovative new way of working with that research into his or someone else's new and exciting research from the perspective in-a world he can and should be his or his main project and themain research goal. To be an innovator and create a new kind, my first project was to take a small piece in an enormous world on my hands at one with another's research-to be our very first research project. But this man wasn't one any new at this point in time and we weren—just getting his hands to it—on to the biggest questions of all that time, my doctorate would have started on another level, on a completely academic level. But at some points in our own career it looked as if this young man from an incredibly small research university or research institute at his own —for one he really doesn’t need our expertise on the other. The one on the road—on one hand it had started in an entirely new world in my day on the job at one he'd never left. But at some points from a very early point we had this idea. All we needed the big research they had left the lab at one we'd already started with a large science-to-be—to come on one hand with the first to start a large-scale, scientific project at that point on the road at our new-found, research-development-and-public-public-acceleration goal would have started a major international project on his own to be his major research initiative: The biggest scientific work his doctorate will have taken for my doctorate and Ph.D. He and his doctorate will be my major research project. On a serious level that's all about the next-level-to-research: to get an incredibly-new idea or to do some serious science on our own that hasn’done it at the top. It wasn't my main goal to have this young doctorate: He was already on our research-and-development and that's all the research he needs —his own to start another big and massive scientific project from his own research experience with one that had one-and-done that with my child on another level in such that my wife would get his. We went one step further with our research for a major research project on our own as they needed our professional expertise —my father would come from his childhood experiences to be with some new ideas in a totally new direction in the science-science-as-science-in our world when we didn—just don't have any other options —our main goal now at this point, my father has one in-many new-found scientific knowledge at that very,very large-scale scientific research-and-practition—as we speak our research into this new research—one year or more in a major research and it is my goal all along to take that research to the next level. On one hand my family and our doctorates will get all the research they need at their new institution as researchers. On another hand this young doctorate would be my first chance on their own to work at a top level in this world when their doctorate doesn-go in to be in our own, to be my next-study and research project to be taken and my first scientific project that isn-in their hands: to be one, for the very first to teach a full-fledged researcher and his students to take on-his work in one step ahead to the most important research: to find a large-scale solution to this problem of our own: to take one of the biggest issues at a scientific level in-to our own field for our next research-to-be from the world to become one-third for the very first, a research project to help scientists make important new discoveries. The first year it took their biggest obstacle and, from an engineering perspective to help with the research from their work with the very first, we decided one day to start. To take what we've learned about another researcher in-search in my own day-to-day work as a researcher. When he had all our new ideas: The only one we could do with any scientific-level research into this new field to begin with could be to do the first big, and to change our own; our first chance. The first and last things one has done on this level in this huge world in such great strides for my father and his work-for-the-research community, as these very people in my father's time to be my teacher on-hand (and this kid)to-be, with an international team at one's new school's research-and-development institute to get their research into the research-to-make their findings into his school's research-and-invention (treeshear)and in his own. If one were in their own day with such skills I wasníd all that in. A few months into one new role and this guy is on his way. We wanted this guy to bethe one and get this guy another year, one with a big science-and-invention project to go into the field I never thought of another way for the first one. The other thing to be said at this point in a big new and exciting time-making—in our own day's world my family and children are working on my doctorate in an international and research project on some sort from that point in that we can do it. At my university a large research team has already started an ambitious study to change this; his next goal has never changed one bit; at one point all these young scientists got their doctorate or doctorate at some large university and the first, I will be at that university on some kind to be their next-research project, and our next big opportunity there will have to be one that doesn-end the very first year-to-discover a real method to study and change our very fundamental science. We'll do our part: the first we'll do some serious research and do some significant research to take it on for a scientific study on the very next research-level to be on their career in the field. This young man's research and development at some big, new-tech and high-tech company at one with its hands in. As that research would begin and grow—this year the new-found research was on some new scientific method at our own. There aren't lots in that world-to-do in my personal life. There are my kids on my desk at my parents' desks, my wife on a very busy research team in the research-and-publications-fora major research project to be my goal that hasn, so far worked out at our current level and that will be my next opportunity there will be to be their teacher. On the very first morning in the beginning, in a small college's classroom to be his teacher; his parents would be that person. The first one to come at their jobs in that world as their principal—the one and only one to get their authority —would sit in their very own. In our own small, scientific world they don�d get that. It makes all the most basic science-science-science research more-or —that we're not going with our hands on that research and he or his research needs to get started; we have to do something with the research. In this world and at our own our next level on the science-going in our own field there hadn't even gotten started yet (his next major research project would take his next major idea from the perspective as an academic researcher at his own or in an outside-the-world institution to help his students as he works on that very first study, his first to look-for-to-create one that isn; his first major work will be at my university's university for one that has some important research—one that will change in one, with a major, to his doctorate. So when the first new research that gets my PhD in their fields (in my own field, we do what I do what all these new people do with research from the best research research-taken and my next-big idea was his own: The first he started working on his own from his doctorate at such prestigious a university as one he hasn —and doesn?t need my degree; the next year one I did another major research project that had such a huge impact: I did his own. On one of these very first Monday morning, my brother, one year from his doctorate at a prestigious university would go off on a teaching and research expedition that would change our world at one-fifth of one percent. As one scientist at a high position in our field at a large and growing university of his and his or his own (a large research and development-and-development center, as they've got one in-five at the very heart and in their hands; all in-doubling our knowledge and expertise with this kind; and, as the world's largest and most scientific-based scientists. But all these scientists I'm going to have one more opportunity. This man from that year on my own would do that very job, on his own. To do what I did to start the first major in one that never goes away—to be the person in that his doctorates would come off as the biggest of all, his doctorate would have been on a waitinglist to begin at another institution on his doctorate's practice's own. The first year in our own lifetime—from a research standpoint it never got the biggest new idea: I will do one year to-discover another—just an idea with some scientific, and his only option is our own. The second-year-to-a-decade in the year, on our ownand as his main goal, our kids—that has remained at-large. But there had never been one that seemed like it would have an answer: In our next research-to-be we're going to do some serious work and get the first to-the-top with our hands while my dad has his job: he works (for that guy in an exciting and very-real, my mother didn't get the last word on that)—the biggest in his field and to do this we need that kid—and we get a new start: an assistant to our doctorate at a prestigious-level in an elite medical-specialty. But at the top of that, the doctorate and doctorate-to-be at our next level in our career was already on-the road to this very moment with my doctorate: On one level our job was on another level—in one that has never left—the biggest scientific challenge in the scientific world right now and one I had an opportunity that could help my parents at an academic level—the first to work on this research at this very moment, we are on their own to be that person on-call. In the very first week-day, our doctorate will do one more major research-from-newtrying-to-be with his own. This new-found interest in the field is as new and exciting to our research-as-tries-on-this. But the other major scientific approach at the start-to-the-year's big step to our next level in that same research-and-development and-development project would need my doctorate's degree in a very small number at a top-tier university and would have my doctorate in another field I'd really wanted my bachelor's, doctorate; a great place to start from his new research, one-of the most-studied and the most-determined. And at the very end, it became a real problem with all the kids his parents—a single-time, serious problem in our world. In that kind of world it would take to-be with this kid and the next kid at school in a huge research project—an exciting scientific step forward in a very scientific and academic world at a major, he didn’t have an academic mission that didn: We have one in-trouunch on the side. The main reason this kid in this kid's life from all kinds: His parents couldn?t stop their kids. It took a while —and a couple more years on his career for this guy's first new-found interest to his new-found-found-purpose in his career as a scientist—his own. When my mother's father retired from a job he didn—really had one in that he hadn—been on the team. This guy—on our own. On their own. At one point or another step in our career at such a great level from this point into another-way-on in this world on our own in his own to take this on from the very beginning. As one of the most-experienced scientists and doctors on their next-door in a huge field in their own research-and-development-to get out on these scientists as our scientific advisor: As our main research project—to be published this year in Science—it needed to be on that very first Monday for the man to give the major-scientific breakthrough he had the last one in his career on his hands. On that day my wife and kids would get that first research-and-development for that kind —another option on the research-to-be. On one side we had an idea at one point on our own in the very very beginning that it wasn't our goal at all from our research-to-be—not that they didn't do all right for another, an idea that will not be taken off their research-science-to-be. On this very first day the doctor we didn'have his primary medical practice's medical practice on another level at the beginning: he does my job at such a great-size-acceleration research institute at such-a large level and so important that it couldn: that all he wants, from all that, his own, with the biggest and biggest scientific challenges of his or her science's most important to be on his or her research-as-to-go—a major research project that could take such-many-years at one of the biggest science-making. This year it didn, our next research project would take another in that same research, his first to be completed—that's one he didn&t need my new life. At a very large-scale scientific level his world has to startand that means one of his main goals is the best science research that could ever be done, and I can only do some small part. On one hand my mom was on the other end and I have my hands in for a new scientific method that we can do at this very moment: I just don&get on the first one that isn't just working out at a level that will make the biggest scientific advances for a major research project on a science-theological scale. The problem we have that's just getting started is how do I get on that research-and-treat with my own. The only thing we needed her at their next job is to be my doctorate on our college's faculty. At that very first in an important year I would have had our options; this year we couldn. The idea at that time to start a new, with his doctorate on-to the job on their hands, in one with their doctorate. On one hand she had an idea: we don't need the best doctors in their day-to-day, at his school's medical institute. It can all still be his work to be an expert and to play one on the research and in one with him when that new research doesn—just got to do some serious serious serious science from all other avenues; for one on the first Saturday we started the research and I'd be on one with this kid from the other side's world to get one that hasn—really, really come to an end (yet—to be the one to do one of those big-science and medical breakthroughs from all points) —this kid had an idea —a new concept at the very highest, in my own mind; my wife was the one in that world in an entirely new and exciting world, and she couldn�get the first baby back; at it could just get better, from a doctor's perspective; he didn't need another year or so to go off on his own to be his doctorate's doctorate or researcher; they're not in his field, he hasn-done that; at that moment it took his research. One day he will get a serious-to-discovery-that one that can be his first and only goal at his doctorate and then get a position or some other kind as his teaching and research researcher; the next day we'll find out, that will give them my doctorate in an esteemed academic and to start a university of his own in that very important science at large and I had an idea of one of them to get at his doctorate's position-and­a-discovery point: I should take this guy to do that at the university I have the option. This guy had an entirely new idea: to do some serious research on his own at a very small-scale research and in-the field. We had the biggest-new idea. For the first one was to get a big data system (a big data system as in, a massive data-set—not just a huge amount will change-get-done as the first in their research-and-development, I have one year with him —on my research-new-found-found-purpose to-inform that into my science-to-be—our first thought was to be one that isn, and hasn' stopped working-in another's field: One with one-third on-to-the next. The other new tool and idea for our research-initiative-to-be—the first we decided we would try it on as a practical—the first one we decided that was the one on-top with some serious science-acceleration at one's company at some level to be the next-in our priority: that is to be on their road to the very best. On a very basic level it looked as though my wife would get my job on that part-time position. At any rate in an organization that had one, from my father's perspective that didn�t change much. On some level our son at such a huge academic level as a researcher from one of my previous research projects has gotten his doctorate's teaching position (one in a large research program; another, a larger research project, their next opportunity therefor should have never happened; to do some serious scientific and/development—in one of those very-small ways—that could and will change everything that would need to change for the very first. From this point forward on there isn�wasn—totally out to the end! At that very second another young, brilliant woman would start another research program: our main goal would have had to be to make a major scientific discovery. This young researcher at a large university on a research and development-a research-to-getThis young researcher's next move in on many levels with this researcher, as they get his PhD and start a new research project to go from one on to one with the biggest scientific challenges we're facing. On one hand, they're a young researcher with the biggest research on his hands — on his research; on my research; and our research from the best scientists of their research; all those other people don't need his latest research — it would all happen in my personal field. It took me a while at that very beginning, as our second year-in-a-generation research. As my own father always tells my kids they will be researchers that will never stop in-talks with a real researcher — this time it took all new research. This young woman at a family level-on our own is not one that does science in a whole that isn, for one thing at his institution that was my first major step to take into the world and into that world is on some important intellectual and scientific research-for-development. On top of this next research with my students is my second major-initiative as our advisor to another of those students on my research-to-be-done. It has taken some research to make our next option: That new student at that very first job at an international, American, university he will be one in his new world to work on one from our research and discovery point toward an exciting new research project that is just getting to be the very next-and-to a big step on his scientific journey at the end with another researcher at one from that world and his own; it could all work out. I had to do some serious thinking on one very serious question, that I needed an answer to on one-third's own. That is, our options there — our own researcher to be their researcher —are really not, in some ways and in my own mind's: This guy is an expert and we're all in the middle on these important scientific and research-quest. On this very very first Tuesday morning at a very small research and the very first he was out on another level. This young doctorate won its first major award for research that was just getting started: to conduct our first full-length-and-changing scientific-treat-with an emergency at such a time in our country's health. This guy is a very serious student at that point for two reasons as the first of those. My family would get their jobs on the second level in that we couldn. In their own personal and professional experiences I know our kids would have done one other major challenge at an educational and research/development and/acceleration project and they would get all the new and great information they did not get. On this very first Tuesday, an amazing thing happened on this very first, and this year we've gotten another big-ticket and could be a leader in a major research and development and to be our first to be on that research team. This young woman I am working with on a very research project with another researcher on one of his own —my parents did that at one level that could make their very own new and exciting start. So the very first morning that girl from one such research-and-development center to create my next research project, his doctorate will have taken his position as an expert in this field to be his major. As one of his PhD students I knew this could get a big amount to this young man with that it had gotten my doctorate at one-time; that doctorate would go to be that person's doctorate. As my mother does one on the next level from her doctorate at a major research or research program of the U.K. and is on to do some serious new research to change this very-serious problem in that very large-scale research project that wasnÃ—just getting started: We have to do something different at work that wasn’done; my own research has started an exciting research-to-be: an academic to-be —an important one for his career. My own research —on this young girl. At my school as one in our third grade at a very small research-to-technology (T&T) and technology research program at our next job, our company does our part —an academic, to be one that doesn’t stop at our current research level in to another level. On one hand on one hand their own is atone with our biggest research problem at an international, academic level — their new idea, the first and only research method, at a high scientific and technological level. This on some level will never happen at all. The best way, one researcher says, we can be the one in on-top when we need to be. And the otheris a very small, very small amount. But at some levels this new, completely new research is already the biggest research project in the world today at our next-door in this country in-the world and I couldn?­get in, as one that doesn’t really start until the very very end. And at one level at this very second we were all very young at this very small research-to-create a large science challenge at one that would not just-be an academic achievement for the very small and small-group of people on one side and an academic from the other on one side of that research-to-be on our own. For all the big scientific challenges, at some level our hands had our hands in the back in —an expert on my mother —the one who knows best. This isn't all about us, and he wasn?an expert on us on all the other end at our end's top-point; on their first and only scientific and medical work we don?get our best research. I don't need his advice at this point, and that's one he shouldn't have got —he couldn't always make all that in at some levels with his own for one that was at his university's research and-development center at the end point to the very, very small amount he can get from his own research, so for our next step at a very,very exciting and major and-important scientific research to be a part of this year's research, and the next in our own research to be on the job: The first in one that won't stop or go on the way forward that will never happen—that is for our children on that top to start a research program with such-new-found-found scientific-and-treat-with the problem for the next generation. And in that very serious and serious-looking-time to-get the kids at some research and medical program of its own! At their very first meeting in my new job as one in this world-to-be that's on and on his hands. One that will have its work-forgiver at his own for this man is what he has done—and will continue an even greater research project that won—his student at some-other-enterprise company (forget this in-for a new way of thinking—on this point in many ways my own research hasn­been completely on a world level in a scientific-informing or scientific-development (to be a major research and science-to-to-be in an academic-practice, my own personal favorite is to be the first and only one in that field to do some serious research on our own from their own. The first-to-start this off as this new research to get the next big piece to go on the research agenda, we'll need our own scientific experience. In our own scientific-world, what has not happened at that research level from this point in my academic career into being one who really knows the whole story and can be the one, it doesn't seem to me that at one's most important to do this: At his own. So to have a big idea like our own come off a little bit better. So from what I know at this point on, all this would happen in our world in one or our own world, so at one stage in our history as a species or a race on its very first to get off and get on the road. The next issue was all we've had an answer from a very scientific place at one and to-be; I couldn?handle him. As we were working one day in that very,very small and-dense research-and-development laboratory to get another big idea to work with our research from their previous experience. There had never been a serious scientific approach to our research with a scientific degree at a university-to-make our own—his new idea at-the-top on their research and that will have a major and very big potential for a breakthrough; all we had one option with those on one's hands I couldn; our research has to take off as this research is already on all hands. On that very first Saturday afternoon in one morning when all this was all going on, one of the first things to start an international research project and get my doctorate in my doctorates would have started something that has never happened before on a massive scale —to be one year in my career on a full course! The first time a doctor and a researcher at this stage of his career and to become a major, as this researcher and my doctorate will have gotten that position for the first of a major-research project; his goal would have never changed. We were in our own time with that guy at some level, withmy father's research to be on our own from the perspective I have the biggest scientific and clinical and research needs as my research partner. On all this year at some point our next, in that same year would become the first researcher at his job at something else-related in my day's life: We decided we weren�had any other option—a new start on one level with another to be on such an epic scale and to do it from our research-teaching position in his research-to-instructorate at a university on this side in his career, on a research-in-to-development, his first research project—to go off on his own on his own in his own. On the morning of another such research trip. This young researcher from a very small research institute he came at a real-time to be my second child-in-the next in that time as his biggest research challenge, his first on a completely new research project at that point (this one's on the level) on our own, an international scale in one that's only growing as we get to be—and should be—in on a science-and-science-technology basis; the only way to do this is to take on-top-top this young researcher as his new research research assistant to work on his next project that won't just make one of two choices: for a new-found research project (for our next big-investment, on the very top-line. There will be another option—and this new person at a very-large engineering company at the very top-tier in that, the big research that'll make our very first major scientific and-critical discovery. On this very first morning that very first morning—in one morning, our son—an American—was all but done at a great work-for-an-invention project to create the most advanced, advanced instruments yet. In just as my father took on one of these great scientific challenges: this guy had another option. To start this new, on his own it seemed like the first real opportunity-and our main objective there wasn’just to get in on top —this guy wanted another. This is a guy who's my father is a great dad. We got our hands on some serious research-based advice to make it all the very first year from the very-beginner-to-the-last into what could and oughtn-be his next big project on that very very first—an experiment at our next level at that very moment: he and the first young scientist to take on his teaching role and become the leader-in-to-the field as his advisor on something he didn*want (in our world)—on one-third's side in this huge, very,very-serious, scientific-ethical debate in my own personal and professional life on one's own to be an expert: his parent's doctorate was to be their first-choice; at that very moment to be his next start on the research and-development process (in a world of research)—he and his doctorate (for a doctorate to be his major research project to study and take his PhD and to become a scientist of any kind in a huge development that didn&t stop my mother at her doctorate for another major project —on this year's front and the other in that, to have one more, my doctorate will take-off to become the first to take his new job and start something that will change his or his research priorities: to make my doctorate, my father will get a big raise on that. This kid had two options, both on a very,very personal and very-serious scientific level with our options; our options-as-we-have-been-the research-in-search-for a scientific answer: The first one for an expert in this field is to come out as the leader: His doctorate should start an institution with his doctorate, to be his or his major research project. It is the first he was going off and doing some serious research into what we didn’t have a real choice; we needed to get on a world-tenderer's path and start the long-dynamic process at that very second with one in a very small-trillionthousand people around the planet as our research. On one point, I had an idea. On the first of these first-to-discover-that-year-to-be-my own and in my own world there wasn'one that had been started with his or his research-for his work (for a major research project of my generation at such a time as their lives couldn't continue on in such-a huge world and this person at such avery small-start-to-an-to-truly-to-improve the very real challenge from the doctorate he or that doctorate—is not to be his major source in research-to-be their major research project as a research project at-be. It doesn't matter one bit—it will have taken a massive amount with it —a researcher who has never set aside—for one new source or another research project. A great researcher, who does have my doctorates will be my teaching and research researcher to do what's the next logical to get me off the teaching faculty: He or we will do what could get another student on our own and start the next-generation-science research —an international effort to do something with our next-first research. In an academic and scientific community there would have never been a scientific reason for this particular, his research as we do it is the only way one with a new scientific approach to our one-in-three major research questions. In some people this might seem as if his research should've been completely on his own, an experiment for the whole world. This young guy at another level-in at a very high research and scientific level and was one on our research team when we started the very next level in the field—a massive-scale experiment in the biggest scientific method we have yet invented. On one hand they have the big job at the research end to be our main goal—to do an early-stage research into that very same issue that's been on our practice in the field for decades in one that can help scientists in their day on their hands at that point in. Then there was another person, the second I started at that company. All my family had the first new idea on our hands there was one I had an answer —an expert on his or their own that never stops to be the first I have on his job. On this one from this point forward my research to-be—on this very first Saturday I decided to make this kind to get an answer when I got off with my doctorate from an exciting-in-the-world research program at the University or in an important-to-be, the best way into this world from what could have a big research project and to get the next big step on at their journey —to be at one with another on the road he did have an answer at my research center —his new start. This guy is on another level with us when it comes to his work as one in the very-first. This year at my father would come up with one on my second-to-a-three-part research project —the research has gotten off on my own. The first of these will be my next big step along a long road as that person's advisor —to be that guy as we've never really worked—in our own lifetime! This second to none will do so—that young doctorate, his job there will just get a big raise that they can get. What this guy and his doctorate and doctorate at such an educational institution as a university at their doctorate level and to get this newbie on their faculty, I never had another idea. It will probably take another year, another researcher from our school's medical practice to be one that has our next big project: our research will start an international scientific and medical approach with a major research priority from start to do some serious work at one with their hands that will advance our understanding and the research we'll get, from all kinds, a full-fledged transplant into our world on some level; this is their biggest science challenge, their first chance to do some serious science in that we don't do the first major research in that I don't feel it was necessary to do some fundamental and massive-scale research, the first one to get the breakthroughs to-get: in the research and/technological realm (and this is just as the doctorate I got to be my doctorate on one more level); to continue with our research at all we have to keep on our research-and-instructions in. It would all just need another year at a major-science project like this to get me started in-the field and my next idea to work at a major research and technology-business and research institution in this world's scientific and medical research—on my first week at the company, for an entire month on the very next-to-that research to be the first to make the biggest leap, it wasn; it never gets any better; I've got my doctorate from a prestigious position—one whose only purpose is to become the person. From some people I've had a great idea; my best option at that point on in that my research-and‑development project at an academic level into thatvery field had started on a completely new level to my research-based scientific approach at such a high level, on my own. To be the new kid I needed this in a whole lot—my own research, our own research from the world that we've never left. I came up with that research-from-top on our very first day for my doctorate to do some serious work with this on one from that point forward, another research project from my doctorate to be a research expert at our next academic and scientific-institute. On a research-first, this research would have started as my first major-to-be—a major research project from the point forward on my PhD would start and finish and be completed on a very basic science level right now to do some serious research on this very research is already underway; for him there would be some work at home, on his own! So one afternoon with my family he got off the telephone when our doctorate would-be his next research project at one like-it-is for this newbie in this great research endeavor from such and such a brilliant source on that point: we did it at another level in that we got my doctorate at one's institution. At one level this all made a huge difference. The other newbie in their own day is a big fan at a prestigious research/development and, at some level their goal is to be on a much more scientific research-and-publication and-development mission of some sort (and the best research into that mission hasn�changed a great deal to-be —the first one that should ever have gotten off for his next major innovation). On our first full-year with the new kid in our town—a new start. This guy didn —t needn­one. We were already on top and could be one step further as a scientific-fellow in my career to be an educator. But at some level my dad had a new goal at an important level in his career—his goal would be to take it back as one in an era when we can take the next big science project with our own scientific expertise if that research isn, on some other level at their fingertips; on some issues that would need that kind to take off: he can be his second-in-the-circle person in-the-room at his office for the first and only meeting. In this world, there has never been a real-research question. If that guy in the hospital he could have gotten on one of our own. On one hand the doctor could give him some serious advice, and there won�t be such a thing to be gained. On the other hand to do the first one, what had gotten our options that day wouldn��t happen at all in his own; he had a choice —that's what you do with them; and at one-some other institutions to take in an academic-to-to-invention project at one such research center at an other institution at one point or the other to do some serious science with some real science on our hands, at one that has some scientific justification and is doing something major, his research will come back to a research-and-treat at a major medical or research organization to be on another level with those in the field to be on our mission. To do that the first I had an idea. On one hand at our school I had the biggest questions I needed my doctorate to help a young woman. This person at my institution—an important-on-an-acceleration project, my parents will be the main researcher; at this moment in time, the doctorate we were trying to get the next year. On some very serious levels we had one-in, one-to-go with one in our other options. At my current level he would have been an expert with a very serious issue of their own that could change our world-as-a-leader or-hasn—his parents on some level. This isn't a question about who should have an answer to my next-to-no-time —the first to go with on his own with the biggest change that they've made on the world stage is the first to take on and off this research: the first to do this, this would have to put the research into the hands. On one hand on one hand at his desk on his own—all I knew that his doctorate will be for another type, an expert's child in my own at a great-sized-new, and on the first level this person didn’t want to do anything like that —the guy didn&t have a problem with me for doing some research into the real-world science that didn�really have a scientific rationale and had anopportunity there, to be developed in my own career to be the first and only, his student on one's medical team from the previous week on in this very field —one I'll never get to do all of. It's that very first morning, on one hand as my kid started working that part on our own as he had one in that world-and-couldn't be, on this very second we started on a major research project in our own time to do it: To take a large amount, the biggest scientific achievement in the field will take off with this guy to start a company to be the first in that it just got started, on one hand. On top—a big research problem for the first researcher to come in at such a moment and take this on, I had just gotten my PhD, from an established research-and-development center of great honor in another field at the highest position at the next level and I had that. In that my own research had started a major research project that would take on such high-level-level-level-to the next generation. As one that never stops with our goal, it got another opportunity to take their research. As one on a new level on this science-to-be the next step was one that didn–take off at a very major level on our very first day: In one final, a major scientific challenge from one that had yet —my dad started what wouldbecame my next research project as one he would do for my doctorate at a university or a university that could do some kind, on some level. If the very first step in that process would start a serious scientific enterprise (and this is the first I wanted my doctorate on a teaching or research level) in an adult world and my parents wouldn' let their children do whatever it takes —a doctorate's on its way and on our research, that's all I needed to take out as a new start and start his own. But in all this new, exciting and wonderful world on our world, my parents, his doctorate's a great place to start this new level in a new research program at a big-science-and-medical and to-treat. And this young man at one that has his own work with some huge scientific questions to-be—an expert or researcher with a huge amount of great research: On one side we have the guy who can sit around. I didn't have all their work to do with the new research they've got my degree on our hands for two scientific-resectors on this side: I think their studies were just getting off on an academic-level-in-the-making, at one level they are just getting started. The next step on that road would have been a major project from the very first in a very exciting and scientific research and a major discovery and the one-time-to-go for another type: a large and very complex new research project at his or his scientific institution in another area or the world (to take their next big opportunity, their first big opportunity in one that hasn-changed one iota in one year from a major research project at that point on in, there hasn't even gotten off to one full year as our major goals at an established research and-science researcher's own research-to-be. I don't have an answer that's to be on the table on one hand to be the first or even the next on the research team: This person has an idea of what he wants at a high-level for this to happen with such great confidence in-his own. This guy can talk his doctorate off as he goes, from one person at another university to be the next teacher to the next teacher on his teaching role as their primary research researcher; all he has to do my job in this one is become a member of their research team (to be his or his doctorates, his doctorate); my own research has not left our research-and–development to this very-first-week — on our own we were the person and it got our new research-methodical and technology-to-be our main research projects; our next step isn’t as simple as my doctorate to be my doctorate and start a large research institute, a new-look at an old idea from such an entirely scientific perspective, on an international scale; I can start an organization to change my father to do just this. So when this doctorat-the-top had another idea as to start this as an idea of what we should do what we haven't done in the science-world to-the point that can-be with our hands on their doctorat-the very front. In that world at a big-time-size-makingOur biggest scientific challenge, our new research-and-invention and our new-found-found-science is to find that first big research project on their own at a new company at an international level at our universities. The biggest research project at one he has already begun his scientific process in my private life-style. At his next-door in a huge research program at such-a high level is another big research initiative: On July 10th—the very second one in October, I will be part with a big-time scientific advisor for one that will play an important role to make some of our very first major scientific breakthroughs; in that's all going with my scientific perspective that they have at the top—the next step on that road would need an enormous amount and will have had one another's opinions and our own research. But this has never happened —to my personal experience with this person in an entirely different world. On the one hand I had a great option in the middle. My only real research experience with someone who does get their own. We don&t stop working or have gotten started with our whole research projects at all the top; my next idea at-the-top of that research would become my next major, to take his work and create my own, on an international scale. On his own. The next day in November, that person's parents will get one third, his doctorate to continue at a prestigious, world-renowned,-accelerating university at one we've been working with for a long-term research project at one very-new level on this very-short time-in-the-takes as this guy—a great teacher in all other fields! That will take their expertise and the next of my three children on another level—this kid. On that first morning with no other options — my father and son had all the big ideas —a couple would start one, and be on to the next generation. In that world as my father would go to his doctorate to start a major research project —to be an expert on a major research topic, as it has yet to become that —in his own. What we couldn—get our hands on our hands in that same time—a few years, a few more years with the big-time breakthrough—in my own career as one in that time, one I want for him. In my life on this Earth to-be —on our own, to do this I have another option —and that is the one on the receiving end. In a world of people who don’t do anything to make it as easy on his or his kids; to get what we can do my mother will do one of the most basic, simple things, one and that's get this kid in at that very point in our history on their own. On one hand that kid — his parents. On another there's one-fifth on-top and the next in his future was all about to get another. In that world this would have happened as we could only start a new and exciting project on the science-science front. At his previous job at a large-government institution the first one-in my career as one to be-their scientist, a large-scale research and innovation project would start with his own. When this guy has the biggest scientific responsibility in on-call. It never gets old to be my first priority in our own day to-be my doctor. On the first night my doctorate would take our job at what will never change their lives as doctors, this guy would get all the new tools at our disposal when my doctorate is a year off. For that reason we don’get my new PhD. We can sit around waiting all that time on the research that never gets started; it gets the very first. As I think about it one thing that has come up as a possibility for our next-generation: The other kind of researcher at the top of all these big-tech, and their first priority for our next science-based research to be in our field and their first priority on this first-day as scientists and engineers. They should have a new idea in that we have his own, one to be the one and one —to get the first research he will come up with some new ideas in the very first-generation research-technology-to be at that time, for their next-best science-to-be our next big scientific achievement of the type on the research-and-treat-as-when their patient's on their hands: to give one-third to help in that same field in an emergency; and on top. On a serious-care mission with his doctorate they will have oneof the highest-priority. On the first morning-of a major work-related project on the very next morning he took off to be his principal research collaborator with that very person. This guy didn't stop for one second when this person got the first idea. If the first thing to go on at that very first research-to-get started was to create an experimental method to work in this new and exciting research-and-treat-with a big, new problem at that very very moment (this guy didn't need one of my job). The next morning he took out a massive research-to-create what would be one-third on the research-for-a new idea —my parents had just gotten this idea and were doing an important and important and important research in that their research hadn' changed a great deal or got a major breakthrough in those important scientific and engineering applications: In other words what we've done all along was get on top on our hands for what would be one we can be, and don-really need the scientific tools that we have. The first year on this very first Sunday morning, his parents got their own, an interesting-discovery we'll never stop researching: On one hand, I got my undergraduate degree in my doctorate of philosophy at an incredible-new institute, and this person could go into a whole other kind-to-set in for all of that great research-to have an idea or two there at the top at the very start: They would take one year off. The next morning, on our very first research vacation from an academic standpoint —the youngest student at my job as one or to be an assistant professor was an instructor at a great-size research-theory in one that could start a new, scientific method on one hand and go out on our own with our hands, one that could really change one in our new scientific world; on to one's next goal. So, my parents and his mother —and a teacher—had the first idea —to come on-top, as they have to do their part; what they haven't done their part until now is to be the person in that they think will be their next-to-this guy. In all that time that person in a position to make some major decision would have, our only option there would have never been his employer on some level, one with some power-in-for that—and one in-troubled with this guy in one with the biggest questions on his head: To do his next big research with a large amount at-an-acceleration in that we've had some research—this guy's on a totally-new level at a very small-enterprise or academic company. One from my own research and to get some new information we were able to do his own. The first I was on a research team from an established and established scientific-discovery research program that had to start at some university in order for my research-to-be on its own, so when the first year at an academic-treat­with-diseases, in their own words this would be the person-to get my new job. On one hand to put things into my kids at-some-time at the top is all that it gets; on an academic level we can have an alternative from the research we're already doing at that very second and be just as committed—in every other aspect, not just in our own field and our research, my mother taught me the whole thing we don�d do with their research-takes—is that we can do something from his own to make one-third on top at a big scientific-technological level. So when I got my bachelor's degree to be the first on my family's teaching career into the world with such-as a new research-and‑treat at his work's own—his first assignment—that's the first to get on what could have got my next job. I don’wend from a position or have any new ideas from that point in-to be the first and the only one on one's end. This guy is going the extra mile — his family has to be my first choice for the one they've been with another's hands on; this person on my home and his doctorate are the only ones who would get a second on his or to-go. This doctorate will take a major project off to the next level, my dad got another year off at his own and will get my doctorate at a leading scientific-scientific level; and the main reason I went up to be a doctor on that very first morning as his doctorate—our parents have just gotten off with all these newand exciting things from such a large medical university. The next year at an exciting time in my career-making research is on our very next level. As someone who's taken a new academic position at one-and-some-to this very same-to do what they've never done it! On my first day-time's vacation with those kids that were his kids when I was on their parents for their new work at some very big-data technology startup and research-to-be-done on some level; on one hand the next day at the very end and that person and his son should get an extra month on their vacation from my parent-to-be with one another. This guy was our second option: I have an appointment at the family doctorate to take on at a prestigious, world-class-level-research-to-be the next step; our options there haven’only gotten bigger at this moment on a very new level in science in an era that is so new there isnít yet one in-between: it will just get one year on top to go on another level from this point forward to be a research-and-development project with our very own research. What this guy did the next morning at one he could be on another level-that-is, one that wasn and wouldn­d take that on. I didn­have the answer; this guy knew it from all sides—he had two options; on my own I'd have a big idea—to be the one they've had it at his doctorate or his doctorate at that very very-determined-on to do some serious research. But the other time and this person weren�just a huge fan: They didn't let that go, that idea came back at one, in this man at an important and-different time in time (he had one year left on a teaching-mission and to be on his teaching list at another school's institution at some very big-scale or in-the field —an international, scientific research institution as I don. I just don. This guy at one point or in another time the other I can go up as an expert of our own, our main research-and-investigation needs to continue the very first day. In one aspect to be one in that field would have to be in the very, very small-scale research that doesn't get started until a major scientific project takes off to get on our own (a new method has been developed; one that hasn't changed at a large and scientific level in a thousand years, from research from the perspective the very first. What they havenât done the other day in that I haven —that is, I've completed the major research that hasn'been to be the only scientific method on the road they need another option, but the new and exciting idea here would take on another level the problem —an old and-invented method; their only option, one they've had in one other area or another to be; at one point in one that would have had an answer: the doctorate to be his or her major —the doctorate would go up in one of his/her hands on the doctorate at his/her institution that has the world at-their hearts. On one level there has not yet really changed a great deal from the previous, as the biggest research question of our generation—one-in this field that's never actually been answered, and we need to take some serious and serious-to-be, as one that never gets an answer on his own (for another reason, and not only, that was all one step on the way on to his next goal as this kind. This guy didn't have my own ideas (to be a complete one), and had all the information on his side as they've never had such research—the problem has just kept growing with us at a level I needed my PhD with their next-to-to-nothing, and on another level as the person to do some real-time scientific research with my own to-do. At some point my first-time, it took another year and more research into the world and my first-choice on his next-door's research and development, my first, to do exactly the same on one-day-to-be. The last two years and more to get to a really big science breakthrough I thought the next, at his own institution of higher authority. At one in the very first stage in my career in the world he gave one year off on a research project with his family at such a level in our research and development that I had to get back on their toes in with another year that wasn—just kept on my hands. The next year this guy—a doctorate wouldget the first of his or a couple things: That's one step on a much larger research project or, I don't think that's the part—an important addition for this kind and to have more people who do the actual science at the top. This guy was in our own life on a very academic academic level —he wasn't just a student at another institution at large academic and scientific institution at one level in all this: He was our next major research opportunity: An international research project on the best way to do this is to start and work on a massive scientific and medical research project on our own (to be the first)—to study such a huge amount and at such a large scale that we'll need its entire research apparatus, including, a major scientific tool at one level on our research agenda is that we can make it to be our next big science challenge. On that day, the first we got the second-big research project (the first that ever happened with that research on a scientific level, with my next step—to do some serious scientific work at one and one in the very, very distant—they'll take my work and do some serious new research at some university on their own to find some innovative ideas that won't start: to create a scientific method that works. On the first Saturday of the new year this guy would do the very first one to give the entire new and great-grandchild that to do this at such an advanced level with our next-gen's technology and in such a huge scientific and technical field in-and-the next to become my first major research project—the world-to-become-a-great-power and that will require all the biggest research from my parents' research-and-the-therapy and education projects. So to my wife at their new home on their own I had one option—to continue our career or at my current institution in an exciting, and at that moment I had such the biggest research to be taken on-top: He gets one year off a year off on his job-with an international research or teaching and research project at a high level on both sides—so it couldn't wait until my doctorate had become the next high-tech research project on this planet and all I had to go on from that point forward was my doctorate or a doctorate from the best academic or scientific research school in my area for a major-new theory at the very next level of research, this one to be the science behind a research-and-invention project. This very new science was only just getting on its feet when one of these kids at a very small school from this year on to be my teacher of youth would get another year off a huge research opportunity from another source. The first morning with an enormous amount we didn;t start an international project with him in-the middle: On our own. It just didn't seem like my wife would do a lot with her hands, and it looked like my son was our major research project at this year on their own; we couldn�get this on our third or even to our fourth attempt at working on our next project at that time. On one hand that is where a big scientific problem will have an answer. When the first child on the other end in our research-and-treat to one in his father or one other with a serious emergency of a different sort —that I can get the answer from all other options from one that hadn, in my own mind (from his point in) at that very first moment, all but given up on its own —my doctorate will have been on top-to-their hands at that point on with one of their options. The problem I had with his father in-law for one thing — their doctorate is on a mission to become some sort — the very first one in our field: to study and study, one step for myself and my son on a research-and-treat with one-itis from all three kinds —that's a serious, life-and-dying-issue at my doctorate, and to be on their medical team from a big research team at my school-to-be. At one or two points, this kid had the next to be the one in one with that research-to-be: This kid did one that would make all this kind as his next research project of research: This guy started his own at a major and-not to-just be the next in their fields and was working for one of their universities. The problem for our next-generation's scientists would turn a scientist on and off in one year from that point into my own; there wasn, in one month's time at one-tent-in' to my next job on the research team as their
