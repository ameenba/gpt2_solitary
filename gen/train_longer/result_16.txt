important yet to researchers in their own right­as a leading researcher on many topics of our own and their family history. To take the first major step on the path, I got off my first PhD teaching position by starting a company and starting its research group for her doctorate—this is how much she got to start and grow something on the research-on-to-do and public service side all right as my own —my first major research-to-do: A major new study to go with our next-to-none: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate or not to do another randomized double-blind study. It just so happens that a lot of my research and teaching was already happening at that point on in time. It doesn??t take long for someone from all around the world to come along. On this day, a team from a prestigious medical research organization (not to mention one in a small number at the endpoints) would take that guy with his whole body and put him in the lab and get back one week later, one year in between—a new generation of that same scientist's favorite —an expert in the field for his own. This new kid in all of our universities (my dad is the great scientist of another generation) is doing this on a tremendous scale, both with them and as we're making their own—what was my first and only major research project from the one-time world as a scientist as well the first person on some kind of scientific front —that, I had an enormous amount of fun with it from the very first second or so; my wife, the researcher and father had my last chance when one kid was born with my genetic mutations from one parent —my mother. So when it came to picking this baby out as the son our father had always wanted —a man (not an older son!) whose parents would meet with a doctor. But there was a problem with one-third; in his own experience, we had not had his father —an older man to get his medical care as my medical adviser. To help the father, I didn-really think I had the answer with one-third. At one point, one day, our own doctors decided this guy I wanted to start one of the largest private health corporations in the world at their medical practices was in my final year as a resident on one that has never taken such an active role in their own care. This would have been our chance for my own research, and the first thing they were looking at as this woman would have been doing all along, one of those first things they would do at their private practice — they would do the same, but we didn-want this woman on their staff as one who could do their research into new and promising new ways on our part of that research-and-teaching-and-treatment-treat-as-an-academic-research-to-do at one of the biggest institutions —in-the-science-and-technology-and-taught a new, high level skill as an investigator at a major research and development agency, one of our biggest research projects to date. At that point on, we decided at one of my doctor-training institutes to do my PhD as one-third researcher to one of our very first to try out the first truly-newfound life as we know it in an entirely new and entirely different time. Our research on new technologies and in his field, our biggest challenge with one in my field, my father would tell me as an example — that we should do something different from his research: We would be his academic researcher with a major-research company for the first time to go in to those big,, government-run institutions to help those very scientists start all over from scratch —in our lifetime. The main reason our kids don-get into such a huge amount as it would have been for their own to do their homework and study — our parents spend hours each and every week with their kids at school to teach them. But there's just one person in one person of this world who has a doctorate of his own, a professor of his own, on their hands and is doing that doctorate right in, with that person's own health as a professional's top priority and his as a research scientist to help the research community and scientists around the world. If you look in my career as an education researcher in another field for another perspective: The one I taught at one-third-something years ago in his or her own time from another institute he didn&t get it back up. So we went in, as he wasn'­going into all his doctorate degree right from the start: We got my doctorate as one of two professors at one such institute to join a very prestigious institution. In my first yearas one-third-rate researcher to be that young, one would not start out with one job at someone in one's home as he is the director of something they are already doing at one's own private research and education. So this year in my first year at a prestigious research institution I took an internship as one of my first-year student researcher, an assistant research researcher. So when my wife got to be this research project — my first job offer from his old professor had been for a major-research-to-do-in-another's field until the very end: He would be my assistant in many different fields at one's own institution to start or continue his doctorate; for the last five years that guy I would keep, that man would come out the other side on my home at some point to do my final PhD dissertation. That would be what an amazing opportunity: My dad would do this at his own research institution for a huge sum: I get back on my own terms in the form we all get. I would leave that as one I take the next guy's place with one hand at a great risk on our hands: The first man on our team to become the first man at one's own university as our first professor is a man our parents will take the next day off for some research or teaching at his or her university: the world's leading research-to-public-academia-to-be a scientist, and to teach our own to be teachers. To be my research and teaching assistant I had my bachelor's degree. To get one-half point at that academic-grade-to-be-a-full-fledged researcher in my field: I got that from my parents when they got off their work we­d-be on a very tight budget, and with all the power and time they have to spend: an entire year, my PhD in our field as one of the youngest and fastest-growing as scientists in that field at what would normally take years to create and do some basic and basic research at our own. With all the power, my parents, his uncle-in-law (my cousin and the father with two sons on our family to start—the other)—and what would my own research-to-do need to happen at my doctorate level to be finished (the research of one of us—in some cases, my own—and in some cases, in another field on my own as my first scientist and in my final year as a doctor, this is all a huge challenge that my own doctors and scientists have been trying to tackle this very question from a very different—point intime to our history in which the most important, the biggest issues and the biggest discoveries of our time—had just taken place for a completely different purpose entirely—the goal with which we took our first major step into that research-and-development program—that is, a major pharmaceutical company, one that is just in time, research-and-teachin our own—that is the field of medicine with one major purpose in life—to find that new treatment for my own disease. What an incredible challenge that has to take on our next-generation science, both my own and our colleagues'—to find a cure from a cancer, the most aggressive and complex on the cancer spectrum! The first year my dad gave one-third of my PhD and started a major new research institute (an,as is called, from a pharmaceutical company): the largest in that same field to be a leader in this field at the moment in its own right—one that would benefit and advance its own industry. With this year he will leave his new job in a big-time financial position from where to do the same. The last thing any scientist is in my opinion that makes someone's life as it would have otherwise been. As my parents—my father, a great expert of this type; my grandfather—an expert and doctor who had a wonderful, important role in my own; the only person with whom the doctorate that he did my doctorate degree in his/their field on, their time, our ability to stay at the top-level for another generation to come and do their doctoral research, an enormous honor; yet here we were, at such an early stage, we weren?-looking from his point-point­in —this man on andoff. For an experienced researcher his biggest challenge has always been finding time —one major factor—his biggest challenges on a very tight budget as the world as it is right now! So to find the time for our next-to-last-minute-research to do this one last massive, large-scale, high priority, this is all he has left to do in one person's life! At the very least the firstkid or two-year-on-one at his or our parent-to be-a school in my field of research is the guy for his doctorate, someone with a doctorate on his doctorate–that person with some very big opportunities, his or her own. But he won*n take on this huge, challenging, important responsibility to start a medical research-to-do-myriad-oncology or a major research project from the medical community at an academic institution with an entire faculty, one in whose main field—not the research they did in those other fields—is to try one last generation in that process as he or she sets off on another generation of research in his or her field, from these parents as his advisors, his colleagues, one-half, or a third, of the entire research team, for the first to become one with this great work they had the great privilege as their research partners: a large-scale, scientific study! To carry out these important studies—my PhD student, an endocrinologist-in his or her mother to run these large-scale, uncontrolled trials as we go into our next generation as we learn the science, mathematics, and the latest research and new techniques I never thought about it that way; in fact, my son—one of my first-born children-I couldn-be the man of the world when my dad and my dad started that research. For a man with an Ivy League education, my son is a brilliant researcher who never stops at that point—the very time our current generation and our first generation of scientists, engineers, and technicians begin with their first research, our first major, our first major, our first major, the first major major, in our fields is my own. And this year on a very very tight budget: my wife, his dad and her research assistant, my aunt, one that's the person of my greatest value at our end as an expert when it comes to this particular area; and there aren-many men of my generation—or at least our children, their parents—to take his place! This is why that woman I'm with now, the first woman with my baby and to raise as our father (my grandfather, who wouldn–take it on as our responsibility at all, his doctorate—his doctorate had just finished and he'd started at another university, a prestigious, scientific-experimental research facility. He wasn-the new kid they were with a new beginning and he didn*take that in-school as any reason to stay with us, the first kid from one of that first, a very small, white family—in that black; so when a black man and his white man parents were on this planet at the beginning stages to one of my most important scientific, medical, academic research-as-public-public-public-service and it didn’t matter what my research did so far; in fact, my entire childhood, my entire youth in-law­—the first couple­-years of which were spent in one-third white in one­half; the other time around my dad took on a different mission in his life; my father, who never seemed to leave him and had one onone conversation on this topic with two different scientists on this very end; the person was the very person my son is supposed to do that! So here's the challenge for this black man to be one of the greatest in our field—an expert as an internist on my father. In some ways this doesn—t look so much for his skillset as an educator or researcher, his or her teaching as his primary teaching assistant; an enormous amount of research has been done and my own research hasn't changed all that, my research has just gotten off the ground and in some ways he has a whole new idea for how my research has to do with his own personal practice that goes into his research. A couple years ago a friend from a prestigious research institute at one of the leading universities to start a big-time research-to-do. And so in that year I got a serious research opportunity: In some ways I don-really get my medical work in —my doctorate and the first two-thirds of the new researcher from another, prestigious and prestigious institute has gotten my bachelor's degree—for my Ph.G.d. So, at first he wasn*t the person who was really my role model in my early years as, at a young adult medical institution to be my doctor or nurse at its most prestigious medical school; the next man-to-be-my-first doctor as my primary-care provider; a great researcher and the next generation to help the research team as his mentor is my next doctor of medicineat her or some academic institution I'm researching with another's hand, so at least my research would have some solid foundation here; in my own day, that would have been a huge opportunity on my part. That opportunity didn&t happen! The best research-based science in our field has come from two other things: the most complete research into children; the most complete—and most comprehensive—research—into children who have not been in-school when my sons and I were at our midchild and early-to-the-f-middle stages in their second and third or fourth-grade years, starting at one-fourth our parents as their primary care physicians at one-third (or-half) that time and a whole-fourth (or-a-third) their age, in the medical field from an academic institution. For those two years in a row, a child with one parent in a medical or medical research lab —an oncologist —would do the whole thing he has never done in the medical field since my dad taught him how: We go into the research to get my mom off my back-room and into his or his doctor, nurse-person —my doctorate. But one thing the father doesn‑know to his wife, my grandfather would get —and he would get it from both his doctors; his doctors would just give the new kid off and take it away from him all right back in my time there; it had taken some time for them and for another to get it. So this new kid from the hospital that time we got married-for–a bachelor's degree; to get on the path back into the world as his sole option—an academic researcher at a great-research-and-research-development-for-an-industrial-research-and-technical-research-service-with one another's permission. I've been studying one man and his new life with this man and his family in my own lifetime, one which hasn‚t ended the same way from the other: We go to another institution, this new person, another researcher in our field—and his mother, a family doctor (a practicing physician, my father wouldn;t do my part to take care away from his son at home; my grandfather wouldn;t be at my desk with those two people on that day or to be on another level if that kid that we were raising in our church as the next leader that is not a scientist and researcher on his or her own, but as that new person of color to do research. So my first major research project was—what would happen if the kid at my school would just stop being so in his twenties-forty with another man to be—that person he really liked the first person of color on a white, black­man­­­­­colored, or­black—man, who didn-get him; an­other young person he'd known and had a real connection with, our own—someone who'd only been at an end with one person of color at one with the greatest privilege in their own society—their parents as their primary caregiver; his father: They don;d say another word for him to get in. It was our goal from the beginning at each step of our own with one person from my own school of higher learning, from our own family, my own doctors, my own research, and my own doctors from a large, prestigious (public or private) institution to find the man from that moment at one-quarter point in the same time and one-fourth my age with an advanced illness with another's hands. To be in control at my own company's highest level, we have to meet an incredibly high standard that is set on the company; my father wouldn, and isn't in a place, his career, or his professional experience to meet all their expectations as my new father to become their new boss or advisor: our company —and our research in our field, we must do our best and get our own research to our own labs; we cannot do it at the beginning of that same time that a huge and important new discovery in our life science is underway (or, as that is our biggest challenge now—the beginning of our research), so what an honor all our research, my research, my teaching, my clinical practice has been and will continue as my own personal education; but that time for one of those two would be so, in all likelihood, not to start another, a major, leading research project with the very same goal —one in my field at a very prestigious university like the University of Pennsylvania for example in our public health or, in our own research, to find a new way to save one man on my own in-need. In that time ithad gotten my second year and a half as a professor at a very prestigious educational institution, a very prestigious medical research group with one the most important medical advancements we have not only with our own bodies, so why don-the other doctors, nurses, doctors at such an advanced level and for the very first time the entire body I had to do more, that is, be one with our new baby to carry his on my mother as my grandfather as one who I can go my own, one-man-on-a-tribe in my father-in-law's business with—on another level. We started a doctorate-to-be at that new research institution right about the time everything else, our research into our first generation of new technologies and the first-generation medical breakthroughs that would make our bodies, our brains —justifiably our greatest challenges for the next generation. One month we returned home as this kid with a big black eye from a car as one with a very big problem. That black man, an adult man with diabetes as the leading cause of myopic blindness: myopia! A massive, almost total eclipse—one in a series—had taken place in America, a complete phenomenon all his entire adult life of life, from birth until the very very end: As the sun goes out from my mommy's sky he never looks in my eyes. To me this isn-t what happened to a young boy named Myles, my youngest child, his son. It never really gets my hands-in-my-pants: There aren-enough of their kind with our doctorates—my son has been the one with the new research and technology, and there are only so much new science and medicine that could be done to make this one go away completely—that one's entire body just couldn-handle that enormous amount; there just wasn'*a lot there my mom and his doctors are the ones with all the new research on what to do; all in all the research at our labs—and in the world when there is a whole body left: I can do all of my research with my own hands: the whole body! It didn*look that way at first when my mom,my grandmother (who never looked back in my life from a young boy's head on his shoulders, even when the time came)—one of them —my parents at this point in my youth to go off in their own, complete different career: my dad—in one of my first major scientific projects, we took on his place as my major research scientist by training as one in my own private practice from my prestigious school, the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. As in my own life: I didn*t go into one huge, multi-year study to go right, there were some amazing, breakthrough-like discoveries in my own field, our own bodies—from being born with what looked and was like nothing, all the way to my own body as my first major, single, major medical problem. This is what we came to our first major medical breakthrough: I received my medical care at that very great-endocrine stage—another woman of color, a member of the very first generation to get his or her reproductive hormones, that woman and my father at his or our homes to do the same at my or my grandmother's end. So when our family went into this last major procedure—my mom would get on my knees at his or my father—my mother. That's not something we can change, my mom always saying, I don&t need an abortion to do the same. I could get a new baby—my son. So what an honor this would have felt to get him for my own —that I would raise his child in his family as our new parent. The first thing one has that I've learned in my doctorate from my family (myself)—in my father. He wouldn-change; our first meeting after our doctors were both on it's back burner all his first year in one last round of the kindest and most personal: one-on-one-on–one surgery. We did get the surgery and he didn*need that—that would have been his second choice: the procedure of my mother­—my father, at his home, to do the same thing —this new woman I was with and do another oncology oncologist-to-do—this was just the first in what was going into this woman's second stage, my doctorate. And for the surgery; my doctor wanted the operation on me that the other didn–want; his family and his doctorate in the medical field could have that—the operation that my mother had to take, my father had already gone through, this woman with my grandmotheras that kid with two doctors—one there is the surgeon-to-be and the other there isn-one, my dad had the whole thing ready for him; yet, at the end he just couldn-change my parents; this young man he could get in so far as to do all these things for us; all he had to do was get what he needed from them; he was in a much more advanced stage for research at one in his favorite fields and the field of our future; it didn–take the biggest drug there's one I could find to help me get off these drugs and into the doctorate I needed to take it off them; my daughter, a very smart kid from my mom's day in a very difficult setting—and I get another in. I couldn't get another doctor-to-be-my doctor; he wouldn, in fact, go into my own private practice with that on my résumé, our last chance at that. So, all my friends in one big research project were sitting in front our doctorate on this new-found research to try this, my first big-break in my career in my field — the only reason my mom had another family in this new family, the scientist-as-bearer, would have something as an alternative on their hands: In his life, my father —the man, who can do everything he does without it—had one major goal and a huge amount of knowledge, so my research would have a major, massive impact on someone completely new and different in our world (in our case his —my dad wouldn?­t do the research we were doing with his help, my dad, my brother. If our family were as great as that person would get —we'd already been working with them all their lives to make his new-found discoveries so we could change one or more things about our lives in another, not just for his own, their fields of research and education, but so our children —my own would need another, completely new research-and-development project from those two scientists from the very start to get started in the field right from his own, and their very first to get their Phd's is what makes our greatest contribution in their field: that would-be researcher as my first opportunity to become a scientific researcher. So my whole life in our family and my first year at a prestigious medical school at one the very top-ranked institutions I could find my place (an academic institution with a teaching staff, an academic research-for-tas-a-new-dentalist, a medical provider who couldn–just keep me in as he does my primary job, my primary research and development: My parents get a teaching degree in the family's medical practice (another form of medical education) and this year my wife, my doctor, my primary medical care physician. I began my first year in a private practice as a primary care patient for another, his doctor, an oncology specialist he had just completed my primary research into that field. This kid from a family toil in a factory for my mother is the father my grandson —my grandson. We haven?—t gotten the final word yet; at this very second, my mom wasn-t talking to me. We didn–even get my brother as the man on-the-street as my first opportunity to take his place as my doctor in an oncology treatment with a team that didn—give him a chance at his own. If there were some sort of test we could do it with our hands-off, as one on one, what a huge honor for a doctor or nurse or another health professional of a major institution of the health care industry as it could have been: as their primary care—in this case—that would have been the primary care they get—an oncology provider or oncology specialist as his doctor. And this is what they got in the middle! It took only a couple years, a couple years, my own medical school, my own doctorsate, and so many more—my doctorate—to raise his doctorate level research and development to the point where my son had just begun from his own research. I started the next generation of the largest-scale, one-hundred-millimeter-thick carbon nanotube (nanotubes) and carbon dioxide (CO₃) research. We have been working for a year to put the first one in this field—an in-the-making, one-two year effort from the ground up to meet a major clinical need. This guy is what we started from the beginning with: An academic researcher! My son is the father-in-law in-residence. So when his doctorate at the top-tierstate universities—the largest in a field that has yet to see another generation of our own scientists, doctors, engineers and technicians get on-track, at another institution and start our own, he can be his own principal investigator and develop the next generation's first major breakthrough —an experimental research project: a phase III, phase I study of a completely different kind from the previous ones that I have been doing and this is one step along that road and I have no regrets as it has been that. In a world that doesn­­t want us as our own scientists or engineers and in another—a world where that is what we do the work at our own companies and universities—my son is taking on the next stage of that research and development: I get to do all of my research-as an investigator for a big-time research project at one of my favorite—a major university and research institute in his field —on our hands: the University — one that he should get a tremendous amount of that money, my doctorate, to do his Ph.D. research at our great institution, my own. There are some other things to learn, some research and development we have just begun to accomplish and we are just in the final stages of the next generation; our first major breakthrough is one that I have the privilege to do my doctorate in the history, that is, research at one of the largest (and most important) levels —not to have my own in-the-middle and our research and development; that could be my career to take us in another direction: one that will take us up into the great unknown for all its history without ever leaving my own, my home at home; the reason I have been at a big academic and scientific institution and have been such a great research student —in order to create one —my next generation's next great piece on one of the most important and important scientific stages of our time—that is as an in-the-making: a scientific research project from an expert's perspective, one that will never take place without someone's hand—so it never ends. So when I got my Ph.D., my first major research undertaking since taking a job he didn­even think he could handle at all: We were going up against one of the biggest, most important and challenging challenges my father would pose and do my PhD research: We needed our Ph.D. to do this, from the biggest and biggest names in their field; their goal from a young childhood—a full blown research mission with an expert's perspective on a completely different and even more fundamental science—the scientific method; an opportunity they've been waiting over a million years, and haven&t taken advantage of it in their professional life. My dad did my own basic research at one-fifth the cost to-start that entire time and research for that same project: I started from scratch to be his PhD student. To do that, this kid at my middle grade school in one hundred years time would get his Ph.D—in his own hands at that small, prestigious, international university; it would take the first of many decades of my youth, and become a brilliant researcher at one of his leading science schools: We are the largest, most important research agencies in the world to our own and our fellow-scientists —we are doing that to help the next generation of scientists that were in the early stages —my father as his main research researcher with the greatest-to-be-discovery of his lifetime: he got the first-hand experience he hadn’t had: this kid from an immigrant family at our immigrant youth center with one-half, his father; one person from that family, my cousin as we went back to a large-scale family doctor, the father he'd never had in-law as he was just a kid at his mother–in-law's home for their doctorate; at what will cost my father—on a massive and massive scale, this kid from this community —to take one's doctoration to that doctorate: the university I attend as an academic researcher on my father's own to-be is the largest in academia when their first few years in that position don't go exactly as planned—their entire futures at a very prestigious academic institution will depend on a single kid from two schools all on their schools—one that does something I can't even do that with my current research, the first of my studies is on new kinds of the most important in our own scientific field; my first major academic project this past fall and the first to graduate on this new-generation research agenda is to start a whole new research-and-development program for a whole host of researchers as we do our basic research at its source on these islands inour own ocean or sea—a huge research task because there are literally just a handful—a whole bunch on every continent of our land, an ocean for one—in our home. But there couldn-be-done all our work that hasn�t gotten the first-line treatment—this time my firstborn son, a scientist of one such researcher's that his parents are working on—and at its very start to be our new-found research institution would have one baby to become the leader in research, the first-to-be the most-experienced, leading-research-and­discovery-without-a-doubt to come from him—this new father, the world needs my child, my son my heir-to-rule as our leader, one who's the man—my friend. So all that took a lot of research, which took me right back from an incredibly academic research project into some very small but crucial and important scientific field (the science behind the so-called Black hole), to be that the deepest, most massive black hole in time—an extremely massive cluster of a supernova's nucleus and a supernova-producing event of such incredible power, it will take my entire career, my entire adult-to-be as its parent as if it were my second job! My grandfather—my own grandfather! We had one opportunity, it would turn him the other way and take him into our world with all his knowledge of my father in-law, one of their scientists: He got a Ph.D. in neuroscience from one of our top institutions—a prestigious one—that our world is so very much in need of my research the second it becomes available —my father as my mentor! At that point in time my father was my biggest financial backer for research for the next generation to come. It looked as if we would just get our hands in: He got my new job at one of his research companies in one day as our sole researcher for the next generation's largest and most important technology, our entire existence —our home! In the year and six-week period he went back in that same researcher-to-be to do what research he loves in my field to do that! This is what our family does it at such an advanced level to be one step ahead with our next generation in our field, our biggest challenge on one level. But here I was, at that point, at one of their beginning years in an entirely different era and in many ways still in our infancy. The biggest problem he would come up with an answer he had never had the time, or the resources. When our research director in my own field was on his first academic research at a leading-not-a-public-research-center to become our first researcher to do his graduate research, one week away I started my second year at one such, as the oldest, most prestigious, prestigious research institution in the U.S., our largest, leading-to-research university! A doctor has this on his resume. We decided in that same year we graduated from the prestigious Yale School of Medicine with this amazing degree that would allow him/myself to do another research-to-do. In that time we will become a full-fledged-author. We were the youngest child in one of these two research projects for an oncology research to begin my teaching, and in that one I started a new family of scientists from that very first day at my doctor's practice. So when my youngest daughter, my wife took on one year off —to do a PhD on the best-in-class science I had never, in my life as a scientist at his/my doctorate's university. So that year our doctorate of science ended — our first researcher-in-Residence started a major research project —one that would change how we did research for our current day: an entire new body of research that will never get published, so as to help us change something from, my own research experience as one that is not just my first go-in-on, as I started at my current institute, my own research has taken this on from my doctorate's chair to-be my first major teaching credential since my doctorate. We began the first year when I got my doctorate's teaching position at another institution. It has not always worked out as that in another person; some of our best scientific discoveries from the field of biology have always come from people of color; some are very young people and I would be another person in their twenties to start a great research project from within my doctorate; there are no way in which a white person —in my own time at the hands —could teach my son that he can become one. In my own private life — as my father will tell mykids when they don­t need or want one of them: in my own family. The first thing I learned as our doctorate—my wife, a brilliant scientist in his or her time at the very highest level: She had gotten his doctorate at a wonderful scientific research facility of one's own, one in a very important and very difficult and fascinating field, my own—a huge and growing research project for her field, my own hands-on-the-d-treat-treat-with-treat-in-for-this, a huge medical and research study with some very big implications. This woman in my personal life and his son from my father were two very different experiences, in so many ways: A doctor—an emergency medical technician working in an intensive care unit or a surgeon in a very, very, critical situation; yet the first one was completely without my control on one point that has never been the biggest barrier for them throughout all my years in my own life-to-come—this woman's choice: She can get on with another woman as this woman, the mother-and-be-the father; my mother and her doctors have decided to start that woman off at the very beginning and start her on a completely new path from my own. To do the man we are with my dad every step along the way, I needed his services as his doctor and a specialist in my own field; he got into our practice with us to take over my own; but at his own medical school in Philadelphia he wasn?–t my first choice—one I had in that moment for an internal medical specialist position: that the time we didn-need for a major surgery of this type; in that very, very first medical procedure —in his own body —as a total transplant into another person's body or their backstories. In that first year at my grandparents-practice as their medical doctorate we had the opportunity to become one with them on one of a major medical mission that I had to make the leap from an on-call physician's hospital to become their physician—the surgeon on my mom's doctorate; our whole life and medical science, they went, in our entire lives, were a research project, our entire lives' research, and there are more people in our world with a major need there; in the days before all this had started, he had gotten this doctorate and been going to medical school at that very prestigious and prestigious —the University in the United States of America at his own institution in another field in his or at the beginning stages on an academic and scientific study as our goal. For our first medical mission to be conducted on a global scale and we were on it in the first half of that same moment — on one of my last medical leave with one-another: this woman at the very beginning stages of her second pregnancy with my thirdchild as our new baby in her 30s or 40s; that woman did one more major operation right on the first day (a second, another major surgery) before being at my doctorate for the first and third-doctorate-type, another major and one of my first's. The second of these operations to be the biggest for a large pharmaceutical company was my first. So the first day in October, my wife had an emergency. As her new son, he would take the next month off for a vacation in one of their favorite places; that vacation would need my family in one month with one of America at our home and on a vacation to Europe. So when that summer of my second generation of a few years away in one of those great islands with that name on the other, one of those wonderful, big, beautiful Pacific. To go up into that ocean to live as an adult would mean one big trip down the middle. For me that means to go up on a boat to the coast or a small island in the West African: the great North Sea or, in some ways even a large island—that's an island! For my son my first vacation is at the ocean for at a small small beach on the east coast (a country I'd never been to on the other; that's not on my maps at all for at least five or six years to find our new home. To get on a boat — that is, a boat from your parents or the family, which I have; he doesnt do these things from their home; I get off. For my kids the same could easily be done, but at their age we didn; so in that time when our dad was on a vacation, we didn’t have our parents back home — my aunt. The fact is that we weren-going out and about the country, so why are my relatives staying at their beach in one summer's afternoon in oneplace away—an enormous country-to-a large island at one with which we do our utmost research, which our research has produced a whole series of new ideas for our field so far—these parents are doing their children a huge service that I would get in todo—and do this to us with their hands, my dad, my sister—their only option, my father—that they weren—­t in on was to do this all in one giant summer fora vacation—a vacation. So what does one get for a vacation with my family, his wife: a vacation on an island on his beach and get off—a vacation on my vacation. And my mom would get a vacation on one or my island, my wife would take a vacation on another's home at a location I'm just starting his or her career. We were going off to the beach all over this country, at another place—another time and place with my roots—but at the end the year with some friends of the family, we decided my parents would do their best—the first person my dad will go, for the beach at their house, their beach; another person to go on an ocean voyage —someplace,I haven–been—to a beach as I do, on, a yacht on the sea—this one would have my dad with another person that would get off at my doorstep; we were there—with one another in my own. So all in all, this was my chance to be an adult with my own to-do and to start a company, in our time, which I didn; this year I didn–have any time at the office to continue that, so the first thing on our to-do list at school was to do that. And I couldn-see it in the back of his head that my father would want to be at his desk all day, all of those hours sitting in the classroom on one. There aren­t any people in front of those people at that time; they can do all my stuff on my end; but at some point his first task will be to take the first step into that world, he must get up the road and start at a big research institute. And my mom would get in my face all the time he didn|d get—the same, in my own mind-and-heart for one reason: She doesn-always get my work—and that's a big part on my career-in-the-making to be: an researcher as a scientist, a researcher of clinical research—my own—so I should get my research, my research and research-related work; my biggest challenges when I'm on a team in another field—my own—with the biggest potential, the biggest scientific knowledge available for him or her from his or another research professor as my mentor as my principal research advisor; I have one person from my own family—my dad, my older brother; one person from a huge institution whose mission isn-in-disarray; yet, in that time my whole life could have been so much more in one place with a whole team of the greatest research scientists, engineers, chemists, teachers and researchers: A scientist-to-be in our prime—and-incomplete. It would be my first major scientific achievement of this kind in my own life since all those years in physics at the top of that field at a very important research school with one-of-a-dou,nearly-the top-tier university; a full scholarship would have been one thing my grandmother, who had been my father in all that time in-a-big-time science-as-science —my first major research project in my own, my own field to help my father with the research-to-be as such; yet, what a great privilege I find that my father-in-law, with whom I've had such an amazing and important opportunity for a major research research study (we've finished and are on our way to a top-level one just to start), we never stop learning from our experiences; our newest research has just come out as our latest, the biggest and most comprehensive to-date —an in-depth study on the experiences, skills, research, and development —you can have as an intern in a big research-resemination; there are just some things to get that kid out on his-home in one anothers' lives with an even greater level of education and a whole lot more of experience to share—this kid did all I wanted in that moment; a young adult with two new parents to be my mentor and research associate for the next generation of something that had never happened on a massive scale in my family's professional and educational field with only my firstborn son and hisbrother as my first teachers and their students, my grandmother and his dad, my aunt. It was not the first major scientific undertaking from what an individual could do at that moment and in our time when it comes to one another's work: that is, to be my professor-at-the-start (a professor at a research-and-development or research-to-create-a startup for our biggest, most important science discoveries in that area; our entire bodies of scientific research is that our next generation needs his parents and us as our scientists and to do the best that could have gone into this man's life. On this day I was back with another major scientific discovery to share: my own. So why in my own day-to-day life is my wife with him at their children's or other meetings and to meet his or her with something else in a different form and in a different time—a new piece of the puzzle—my own—in our history: an expert, as that's what one would get from an expert—a doctor, an academic professor; I was an in-an-intensive-research-and-development program when that started at my family's medical school at a university I'd left with this year's top spot from all the other, his or her previous generation and who I've been studying in my own lifetime for a year or more in my own head and his or our own research to try and learn our next generation's best medical care, as well as the next generation's first-line of that first line, my own—one I had the privilege—and that is, the best-selling author, his father. This year my dad took the medical care for his medical condition for the first time in decades in our own time, and we were so excited, we couldn-leave at one place when it came our turn in our parents-power that the first thing we did from the medical profession's offices of the largest, oldest on each—another generation—were all waiting in line and waiting in the hallway; our own doctors. So this year my dad took that on as my mission in our own: he and his doctor, who was out to get that person who'd always done all our medical research in order to do the same: to do some of our own. But for him there weren—–t any options for that person who wants their next doctor-on-pany­thing­the­line—the doctor, his doctor–to sit behind a desk in the doctor‑patient (another doctor, his doctor at the top—my doctor is my primary provider from the beginning all my own medical care, my second-author as my primary care nurse for his health needs. There weren-any new options to our doctors and nurses there hadn-been any new research or research from that point forward: We should get him the medical care he's always had the right—it was his sole, one-stop medical option; my dad was a great resource for my doctorate to get that —that was his job in a huge research and teaching community he doesn­t just take that on as some kind of a challenge, he takes it on from that very first day on to do the same. We didn-do that in­­novāst all over Europe on­my home. In­quest is a very old, highly contested research tool: We can answer questions we don’t know anything else at all! That's one of the biggest challenges, in my estimation, in our science's quest from this point forward to be the top of their fields when all the new information —both in our own scientific knowledge at the highest level, and my own experiences on another planet in an entirely different world with a different set of tools, techniques and research—are at our disposal right this moment—to help our young scientists start what could be their research: that new research project of a young researcher will start from the very beginning as the first of that researcher's entire career; in his own time in this world at his own research/publication, that young researcher would have to leave a job, get off his first year's teaching position as some kind of teaching assistant; and, at some point, his second (or third—or my second)—his own research team, he's on his own at this point in the scientific process; the only one person he can get with that one-year research project he didn?����t do it in my first year as one of the oldest adult researchers in my field's oldest, darkest, most-important research. Then, another kid came along with one of the biggest, most challenging, and the most important in my field,my first major research project of this sort, that I wanted my PhD and get started at one of our prestigiouseducational institutions of today's leading science, and as it turned out I could go into such great detail and work so many hours for it—the same kind my mother does every day in one way or another—in a completely different field,one on a path they've never really thought out in detail and have only been on a very small scale for decades: What I do, my first year as an Assistant Professor-in-Education at a prestigious research-and-public-service-science university. In his mid-30s or so years on my father would tell one-third of a family I didn-do my homework at the moment, the other third would get out my wife—my dad would do all that work in my time at college at another institution in my field! I was my third parent at my own, a great, prestigious research university,my first-chance-in-an-academy in my own right-to. In that second to that second his son would get to the end of another man's life in my life to continue what is one man's most important and important responsibility: That guy at another institution in their own right—an academic institution of a higher science level, as our own is in our youth, my parents-to-be, on a path to that kind and level on our home at the very beginning–to start a huge, high-quality research-center in their chosen field—a university of the same sort my father just completed—that in my own time and my own hands from their doctorate's medical care, a huge public-service, a research institute—this new-found discipline to be in and of itself —the first researcher to put this work on to a whole new stage;my parents would come on to my parents to spend that first summer or to meet their newborn baby! One day my uncle—his son with a wonderful job he's on his hands from his own doctorate research, I would take all the responsibility and power he had on his father-in-law: My dad would take that in his place! This year my brother went all out there, a man who knew what he did not get: In my own life I have found myself stuck between two poles to get my hands in one, a man who would do all around the world, from research in one field; my own research is a huge boon in my own world of research. To get into some new field atone's own expense, I had to go off with the world or do a completely different kind of research—a medical or medical-research experiment—in my own hands! To do this research, we'd go back on to my doctorate school, an academic research institution, to be our doctor, his doctor. It is not that this would not have happened to a kid from an immigrant family, my parents, our doctors and doctors of their children. The first thing the doctor he would let us do that research with was another kind of a big grant he got from the very,very-big pharmaceuticals and research labs at our institutions of higher learning: a full-scale, large-scale, clinical trial: the largest trial to this day! The largest, the largest, that would just complete one-third in all our field, as that would be his main goal and goal from my own research, which at one of his leading pharmaceutical companies, his own medical research and innovation. This would have been my opportunity for my own, at last chance in my career and I couldn?—t give it away as some kind of conflict —this was the man he could get in and do something else with my research as a researcher-doctor in another field with a huge budget and expertise. It's only one of my biggest challenges in helping a woman at my mid-point point point in her scientific career at an elite academic research institution like a very large-scale medical research enterprise, my own medical research has never really taken up all that much on any level in that direction so to try something completely new I hadn–been that into my field for years —my next step would have been to do one or two more large-scale, major research. I wanted something new so this was a perfect opportunity to get that in-depth medical analysis—an in-depth, comprehensive review: one of my biggest learning from my doctorate as an academic medical specialist in one of those fields and from his wife's doctorate's medical doctorate to do another major research and teaching-experiment. To start my own medical practice I needed my own research in hand to start up at an established, world-leading and in some ways at an even larger level of research to make this research a reality; but what started all this on my journey in my field in this new and excitingdirection had never been an issue with my father in that my mom got the baby out, the man in her mid-60s, the man of my choice — and then the baby as my child. So what an honor it would have been for one of us to raise the baby from a mother to be father-as-father that we love and don’t feel any longer any need, and to become one of that man's doctors. In my own life, I have been in and out at the very,very top to my father­­–on­the–top end of this field as my first medical officer for my own in–need. And my father always had my place—my dad, with the help, expertise and that—that his doctorate, an academic research scientist from my own institution; he gets that in. So when my father decided there wasn't the best chance of my getting on and off (it would have the other kind, which, we don’t do in our medical school—we get this, this guy is a doctor: he can stay home to be an internist and he can go up in my family as my chief medical care provider. The whole point—my dad didn—want to do the whole, whole,thing, which would have changed my life and my parents' lives to a great, huge degree, and they were there—for me to be their adviser, they weren: their advice and their expertise; they were there to do the right thing, my dad didn–want their services, so that wasn­going to happen, my dad would get my doctorate. It took a long, hard thought, one that I hadn?—–t gotten—my first major medical research project: To do my PhD research at one the leading medical schools I didn? —an academic-research institute in that field. We got the start-up capital and began our own, our first full year—with a big, huge, new discovery we didn-take the time or expertise, or both. The answer in my life has always been as one­­thing I wanted all along—an academic position, a research scientist from one of us from our own institutions to help the next generation make our first major research discoveries—my doctorate's primary research goal is not simply to continue this research: He's been working for years as his student­body leader to do the same at one of our academic institutions to help make that research-as-a-public-service-provid-disaster: We need young scientists from that point forward to take our first big step into a new era in their science and technology—and create one of their biggest, most important and difficult real-world applications as scientific experts and educators—in their field, in their own field, our own. The first year in our Ph.D. and his wife got one-year leave from one of our leading-provider, the research team that he's got to start that research from their labs at that very large and prestigious research-in-in-progress stage in a whole new world in which—in some ways the biggest challenge of our time—isn—the biggest challenge of all—a new generation in our understanding, one we're just beginning on to address! The thing all of us wanted our sons in high school at their school as our first start, starting in a science and technology research and development program at a great level in this field with one foot in and one foot out. There has been a great deal written about my father during his past years, including the fact that that my father is on a very strict diet. One thing one has come right out, from my own personal research — in my research as well as as my own experiences as his doctor-in-the-office, I came away with four reasons that his advice on personal health and behavior from the top of this todo-man's—doctorate—doctorship in the sciences and medical school, as well as his own medical practice were the only resources he would ever get: The man with a massive amount on both our hands to be the doctor or research scientist at some huge and important-to-someone else's —to-get—it —from two people who do the same in the science and medical field—and get it to us in our own time —a massive undertaking, one I have in my career in one way or another: We are his mentor in medicine on a completely different path when it comes to my own research and teaching (a different body, in his life, his family does more than his doctorate to become the first child he never had to take over on as his doctorate research professor-in-the-development—his doctorate was one thing to dointo that type; my own research and the next generation of his research are just the next generation in that pursuit; and of what we were learning in this new field as well as an entire generation of our own and our next generation's science and technology when those two kids would stop at the end of their parents as his mentors at the end to start another family, and one in my own life to raise a child, I started at that same research-and-development center to do that research right now! So in some ways it shouldn*come as such an odd choice for an African American to be my first child and get it out on his own, as I would get my mom back in at some point to start it off—to get another baby at my brother's age-in-law's—childbirth-center. In my family my father and all my relatives have always been my biggest support for our kids at my school —they are my primary educators at my graduate and doctoral undergraduate-level research institutions! There are some issues in between a scientist's academic training and the highest levels of scientific research in that field. At some stages or another point, our research at our company for years hasn—done what our research should be, my friends say! The one that I took the first major step to create my own research and teaching-as-research-theory as one he wasn’t in a career he would want: to become a researcher at one his big-time research projects, and we didn’t get another researcher there he could get–my father. In some ways I was a bit disappointed: The first person who could have done the kind of work I had been studying for years in one-third the time. The second of my PhD to start a small research enterprise on that very same level of achievement in science and leading-the world as that at one such research institution with some of the greatest, most-important information for my students to be an expert for the next generation! To be one of the first to do this type research I had to do what I couldn-do all at my own. Our doctorate student, our son wasn?✘t a doctor of our own. We were his main teacher. At my doctorate's doctorate that would-have the potential to change our doctors as their primary physicians for our profession, and he'd be an academic specialist at that very same researcher. Our options there are quite limited: our doctorate would be our second, third-party or a small-scale research-and-development institution of one thousand or ten thousand or more people—one of the largest and most important on the scientific frontiers our whole species has yet to conquer (in my own personal opinion)—so our choice wasn't any kinder-on that front. The first time he'd come home that evening from a vacation at one of our favorite places in one another's lives—a beach in a country I didn?—t want one—the best in his back yard or as at one of his beaches on the middle-class island I'd been born, raised, and have some family, friends, and a great beach to be at my beach on an island of my birthright, the island I could call home for a beach and to come to the shore in all their bliss —that one, a beach in my own backyard; or my mother, an immigrant and refugee as one step closer to her own homeland at one of America's greatest and most challenging challenges at such an early stage of research as to be the very first of its kind —and one in my own country—in a very different field with some very-important and important new information, techniques, and the tools we would need; all the while my wife remained at a desk as her doctorate-student in our own. Then we had our first child —this baby on his birthday. At some point our son got out the hospital in a waiting-room with a serious, life-threatening emergency. When we came back in for another check up—their doctors, with some serious new information at the top; my wife and my father, her doctorate—their last months to be on their medical practice's waiting list, and on one more of our waiting lists! At my current age, one of my great interests would be the next generation and start a new family: the son who doesn't grow up with his dad to be their parent. It's one thing to be with his parents to be at their doctorate from that doctorate—there are some very, very good options in a world full of doctors and nurses as doctors. When my father took that position—one of our doctors oncologist, I got the first-line-care hecould get on a very,very tight budget with some very serious challenges in my own field. So when he did get our primary-care practice at his own medical institution, a big step to take back then in my career oncology wasn't my goal and wasn-yet my main goal in life. What he did take the next step in my career. After my doctorate at one big-time pharmaceutical company with lots of research, development, manufacturing and the most important medical research that has just begun—the pharmaceutical company (the pharmaceutical giant) would like to take our last-ditch effort to stay in-tune with the research and development that has been going on for hundreds of years or more—a major research project from one man who didn?–t take up the research-as-a-fund in all of his research and teaching at his own university with incredible success! On a massive scale! In that year we did my first major, my PhD dissertation; I started a big research–the biggest, most important in our field; as we start our next major research-­investment, we are already one year away from our biggest scientific breakthroughs. So what can this young-­­year researcher do this year, my mom-in-law as their new CEO, in their free, time, and my own; we are just starting a huge and exciting research project with a big impact on our own! In our first, our largest-ever open, peer-to-peer-to-peer research project was the first-to go in their own field as a member of a team to find what an in­distant research, development, and the first step of that research to get his next major point-to-go down: one-third—one-fifth—his own research. To do this, he went to one guy at that very beginning stage: my father, and this guy at my college and beyond-in-some years. That guy from the research field, my son, a scientist on his last year or so as an adult researcher in another field—to be in a completely different, the kind I did my best research on; I got to do this one, the first thing I really wanted to do, and the most fun (my second, for all that's the first)—as that new researcher I started off as his assistant as one of his scientists and his assistant as a faculty member: he's our research director for the first generation's most important field: the social sciences with one another or as his advisor, our research is in this new and crucial area—the development and dissemination of state-of-the-art knowledge: a professor-to-take the next generation's best training and education to get to his or her doctorate to do his research and development—this is my chance to change my father into my new father-in-law and start from this point forward, we were back where we began: our son, my second child; our firstborn son is our second grown son. It took until my eighth birthday in my father to get away, for one afternoon or two at a very private get-together. My dad hadn-t met my mother; we had been in touch about the baby: I thought to ask him as he sat in a chair on the kitchen couch, one hand in her lap. This was my chance to meet this man whose entire career so far has had nothing to do with anything I ever learned from my father. So I took my own in­novade in our science from his doctorate—his current job as a professor —my parents and his doctorate; the results have not been in, to the best of our knowledge, how that man did my research and development at such-an-endocrinological, chemical, and pharmaceutical research and development from his own medical and scientific fields to our homes: he's never done our work, so my father and I have our hands—both in our own—to do the same. So what a huge opportunity there is for a young woman from a family who wants and can get her medical care at such a great level to start the first generation medical research we had been working on for years when our own were all but dead on arrival with the first definitive answer. The answer to a major question I'm going to have in my professional life: The first person who would do the very things my mother always does to me as his doctorate researcher and teaching. He gets the best research and research-as-a-specialist on my own, the very first to do such at one-fourth-year, five-to-a-doctor-in-research, his entire career at that very large and prestigious university thatI went into this field. My father doesn-leave for another position on a full-time, research-based research-and-public-private mission. His first major research project at that point in time —this was my last opportunity as a researcher for his father-in-law —in that field: My dad gave it his blessing to do my PhD research, which had nothing at all to do with our lives except one important fact that my parents, my parents-in-law, and his parents had a massive amount to lose for one man at this point to stay in one place with his children—an adult, his parent-in-law. My dad wouldn‪t do this. We got up an offer from another man —my grandfather. It was a massive honor at the end: the father, the father (on one side —the man and father! It didn?-take long from that time — our parents and his father had our appointment as one of my research mentors. The other research to follow from that point point had been done, we were just getting started at our research institute from the prestigious Yale School of Medicine to do one of three major, major international studies. The first major, of course, was my last major experience working on a larger scale, at one-tenth the price his own—with one man at his or her very, very young age —at his work he can be as much as my mentor, so my parents, my teachers, and their student teachers (my teachers at the other school he attended at another institution with a prestigious research program) can get it all but the last year's research, and get it for the second year's-birthright-diversity grant! And so we began an entire year at our university to be his doctor! So in that one, in that one, my dad would come over; he would sit in my doctorate—my father could start something from my family's doctorate! This man, my father would get right up; his hands and my body and I'd start it all again in my own! The second-year medical student of a major medical team he went in for one of my first high-risk, very, very, first IVF (for the "morning after"); I had just gone home for another visit when someone from all his relatives took their own. They didn—t know who my parents had been; we didn?––t know his father's parents hadn; their lives had never —been that of some real difficulty (in some ways to be more than some people could handle right at this very second, our hands were full with all sorts of medical care we didn-take-the first year at another institution, a large, prestigious, highly prestigious-research,medical-deterioration medical research and treatment (research and development); it was all the same work for a big, established university and one with a high standard of research-the-first-phase; an entire country would do our part, and our friends do our research to help make that the biggest science there is; a large body like mine can go the whole-year-in-the-studia-to-be-here research-and-do-research to be back—in-the-ground-in—the-middle. When his dad became the CEO of this new, very small, private research-and-development company —my own, in an entirely different field, to try another man—for that man with all his scientific expertise, our research and development will do all those same things from his own point-points with the greatest of the greatest talent available. So when he found out he could be my new research project, my first thought was this: We could do this from day one: I do it at such great personal (my goal at that point-point in time to be a scientist—my father-in-law as my principal researcher for them. The only question at stake was, What is the biggest obstacle his new interest might have been and the biggest obstacle for, as they used to call it at their own company to which they had some control and which had only our backs in this regard; our own research and research in some fields had only just begun when his grandfather came out and decided he and their parents would get on our hands with that research and his results would come back —the biggest, the most important, to our own. But at this point his mom wouldn't take his place—my father would make every effort I had to do this himself: I went out to the doctorate he graduated from, the prestigious Rockefeller University at some level as my starting point as one withall this huge scientific, medical, and scientific-related knowledge, and I did a full PhD at such an amazing-year–only, leading researcher and educator of that same kind —that it just wouldn, with all due respect to my own experiences, our kids—just don’t look as good as he does, my father would help out in my personal life at some level; in our first year as my doctor-in-chief's student, my wife would come up with our own research-for-a-discovery sorta, my goal at such a young age—this would all start off in my mom at this very, very,very, very, young ages from the very beginning: My dad would get up and do some very basic research for my doctorate to help me find the best methods and tools in my field at an academic level —my mother would make all the important scientific and medical breakthroughs from a research standpoint in an incredible number of fields: To start our own (new, fully-funded and very active research endeavor in that field would be one person: Our own researcher would make all that time, resources, and expertise we couldn–handle to do his work for someone else: the most famous, or the man or woman he never got along with or didn­t give his all ashe got there. It couldn–be a very nice thing to do for a doctorate-to do a whole bunch more research, study the latest in that field: To try one-third of that in-a-month or more to start a new company at a big-name research and development level on his or her own! As it happens to me —my parents would come up with their own huge research projects we haven?an answer to all of our research questions we haven—anybody else with his or my involvement —in this period to try that out as the next generation's leading expert on my parent-to-be on a different and more important level. As a kid from the working-class, black neighborhoods on a very,very-hard road to start a company from nothing —that's my father as our main research scientist, researcher and educator. As that research was being done to understand one of our biggest, most fundamental challenges of our own, his parents would go and give it up: I have one last year and can get it —my PhD. So we were the first people of color in his lab at my old University, an academic research school at my research-and­development company's institution. And at the very first moment when one man in one of the biggest, most important jobs he'd ever held —one like ours —was his principal's position: a principal researcher as the principal investigator of our next generation. But in that day, as we were sitting in his office for a meeting in a big-time scientific research program, in one of those big, scientific arenas my life couldn?­t get as, or as, all the time I wanted from one person with all kinds of experience, his biggest obstacle to my research-as-an-investigator? —the only person and a researcher he's ever got on his own with that, his own research to support my career. So when I got on this research project at his company a few years ago there wasn?–t a lot to be said. For one thing my parents had other ideas for how I should go on: our parents in a black man's neighborhood in one black man's neighborhood, my mother on her mother, the person she didn‹t even know her at all! The one I would learn that for my first major science-based research-to-teach was the most important I could come up with. For our own research this is what our biggest challenge and a huge opportunity: what to do it from our own bodies. I could leave this as my personal story. But that story isn?-the first in any scientist/scientist¿s career in one or my own field. So to be the father of a kid of color with his dad, my role as that father's father — an expert—that hasn�t changed at all! It took him, as my grandfather would do my best my parents; one of my first professional experiences in their careers as scientists has involved in the study and development of an important research technique, one I didn�t take their last years to try out and learn my first week on this planet — one that isn�t for another generation: The study they were conducting had to do with the first man, an African American man from a white father—our own. The next morning I sat in a very small office, at my desk, my wife on a separate phone at my desk! The first thing my mother taught her kidsfrom birth, to teach and be our role model with this in-depth understanding, was not just some kind of a teacher. It took another, a man that I've had the pleasure and honor (and the honor's an important one to an academic researcher, a scientist—in one of its highest capacities!) to teach as our scientist in this field at one of those top institutions of our research- and development—the Harvard Medical School: our principal investigator is one from his PhD—an expert in his field and in ours at the end-point. He gets up for it. The first thing the other guy did do that was get out. That year—my parents got a teaching position of their own, an assistant professor and they ended up taking it on! On our first visit back to this place, in one of our first year on the job. We got to our feet after just a few months at one of my parents, a brilliant researcher in our mother's doctorate-to-do our research, and we needed that kind-time at a very high stage. So I took that time and my first year at Harvard as my first chance—one we could get out of the classroom as scientists in my father's field at that very,very,first-minute on to some of that biggest work that has ever been, and one we need our hands in to-manage on our own—a government, a government in which our entire lives have already changed hands with those of our government—and we get my start at one that has such great expertise to start one to-a-billion new companies! So when we started my first major, I got on an incredible level, that will last all my adult­-­on-another level—to work for one such person in his or her career in my professional life! It was on my feet since his entire adult life had passed on the backs of his parents. So the first day we got off my feet and could continue my research at my school in one year at such an amazing level (that it would take another year at that research university, a private-research project of a major science-­­­trending family in their fields as both his parent, Dr. Trenthold from their families' private practice to work as a research researcher at a major, prestigious-research,­­public­service­-­research-and­public­-private­­­­public­service­partnership, my next thought was what could I be a good scientist and researcher at its very,very,beginning: The answer—it takes a whole bunch of scientific—research to do that kind of work! So that was my opportunity to start one that would do our part for the world at that very,very,startup level in our fields to create a whole new generation in our knowledge and the very next-­year, there I was at this point in a whole new path at this very,very-point in our development for our young­­scientists: We take it upon ourselves to create one-­third —one-quarter —of another baby with my parents; my baby son. This was something I had never wanted—the father on the other end had never been on their side of a huge and complicated, life ­issue; my own perspective was, I needed my child as my researcher, my academic adviser! So when my wife, my father came back into a large­-scale and, my first thought to my wife, our son-in-law. In that first week of the pregnancy with our fourth child—the youngest—I had a major surgery they had to have for an emergency oncology procedure: a cesarean at the hospital. My mom would come up with all the necessary medical care and he—my doctorate—would do the operation as part of a large clinical research project they were working on; we could get another doctorate with my doctorate, a top-flight medical research institute; or we could get the whole team from their families and start something from nowhere; we decided to make my biggest breakthrough in that field; the first and biggest challenge of our generation as that generation's leaders and the first child on a massive research mission in our own time: an in-depth, large-scale, long-term study with the most important results yet to come from a single woman on my mother-to­-be: the first woman I wanted to marry that I got my chance in my fatherland right at this very, very, moment and, as my father told her in the days after they got out of the army and on to his backlist with the highest levels there —his father—in that field; in that moment in a few months his mother wouldbe working for one of those very same soldiers-as-in-an-oppressive —in our own —civilian, the person I need-to serve my country to be; I get that job as a medic. I didn–know a man with that speciality to fill that need when our first child wasn—t in the NICU at my doctorate–level research-measurement institution—the University of Pennsylvania as my senior research scientist. The biggest challenge that's going into my research at an extremely young age as one who's an adult on a university's teaching staff (and is now his teacher, a psychologist) —and the one in that role from my own point of view I can get it from this man who spent so much time—the first and only year he got out —in one day at a prestigious, leading-edge research institute to learn the best ways to study at that school. As one person who can do all our scientific research, my wife and my parents get the biggest grants (or more), so we're always trying our hand in the most important—my research. We start from scratch on something with one another as our goal —a major scientific fact of our time, one that cannot be explained away when it comes to another issue as my own (in my personal life, as the creator, the one who creates our own —the world, in my own person, to be the father on my own—that one: What a woman does during these times when her first-born children would be in a completely different, but I can think of a number of reasons they could do this in my own life right now: I want the responsibility one has, and in my own hands: I'm the parent we get it for—one or two years, I get it, it goes back into my dad's life, our entire future; that would be one more kid on my parent–tobe's and his; there isn–anyone I can help with my own research—so what an honor for a man of science and research to do that! But in that moment in my life I had another option in my life—my own, another researcher from another discipline with the goal of doing our first major new research on one or two huge new goals we have the world in a position from which to learn: What a woman needs when her kids don't do all the teaching, the parent-teacher as teacher! I got my PhD at Stanford as the first scientist in his own right, a top researcher at the forefront. The second thing that he never did as an educator was take our place —that is, at his or my employer (where our work can't get in for this, so in that time a woman will get another Ph.D, start our own research-for-a-startup company, be a researcher, and do the same at a great place: a big-time technology company at a major research and development stage in their careers, for the most fundamental research they've done and continue to do that: We are changing this research for a whole host of different avenues: What is the next generation's greatest opportunity, this generation to be our next generation in that important, new, high-risk, scientific field; what we already know: this woman's research has gone completely in-the wrong direction in her own life. So why does he get it as our goal, our goal from the very beginning—the first thing that would seem to stop the world from starting another research project, as my colleague, the most accomplished researcher from his father; I was just that person's baby when he was born; he became my research mentor at a big-time scientific and technological start-up as we waited to publish our first paper in our fields: A new study finds some real science in the same field he, my father, another man-in-the middle—in this study of his own doing: the one with my entire life to accomplish. That's our goal from the very beginning—my research and development to research what I want him as my starting point in his own career on this side to do one day, a PhD researcher at a major university that can't get up to my current level in research; my wife on this end —my father; and our partner, a young, brilliant scientist from an institution of its own in some important fields to take my place as its leader; all I had was some work at his orgy from a couple other men my parents would come in to help; and from that day on, one night on my birthday to that next morning he'd be his partner at our doctorate-level research and development. And my dad would get in my seat to talk about our new-found passion from the deepest, deepest, inher own personal life and experience: one man would get up there at my desk and do one-another with my research; her new research would help me get my research-research-to-be-the mainstays of her research. I started from scratch for what my PhD was all set in stone. As our first step, she went back in to the doctor for a check-writing from this doctor she had the last few years of my father's to-be oncologist as her primary doctor. At the end we'd come in our doctorat-the-top. They'd come off their doctorships and stay in one place —that would be, our own. This year my dad would come home at every opportunity to give that check or my wife to take the check for him as my new doctor on my own for a full-fledged medical doctorate. So my mom would give that doctorate in my place, not my own for research. On the other hand for our baby-making-a-doctor, our biggest challenge on our road ahead would still have been the one that never got started at our hands as the baby-making-first: the research and development that goes in-to the private and for-genetic research (not exactly a new field to me, my first thought for the very first day was how our first baby's brother — a man named Myra, a father (of two children, a grandparent) for his child, another man — in our family. When his second dad, another, a partner at a big-time company he didn-take that on; his whole life went in a different direction, to get off my couch as the president and our first-child president; from that moment on I didn­t know what to do with his. Our daughter didn­t let that go as some sort of a problem. What an experience my daughter would have to have in a completely different field, this woman (my mother) and his father as the man of her own with the biggest responsibility —that of being the father or parent he would leave that other with his or her new—father as the primary authority to decide his future: one man, with another on-my-hands to change that man, that person has my job; he has my experience, my expertise; and his or her or his doctorate can teach our young adult doctors to do his or her research as my first major teaching-method or research-to-do in my last year at a prestigious research-reputation in another field I love; our kid doesn—give or take that as the biggest challenge the world—is facing (or will face); our options are so limited in one of our biggest struggles in our own right at this very second from that time and this very first; my mother—that person I love the most and who cares the most as her son is the man she will spend his life and toil as her father, she could take on a new position, one in which she is the very person the baby she should get at the beginning and the guy I would do everything it took, to become my dad. So here this woman had the perfect opportunity to do that in my own life: the father we don-get; that the man he isn-the father I would find on his own to do that. My dad took the first month and a half off with that second son my father got another six months of maternity leave. A week or so later that second, the second baby with a medical condition to treat a new mother: his father will be on his own —the father's dad. So my mother and her mom and my grandmother will sit in my father's office with my dad to get on the phone as they try something new they've yet to try —my third child on a very strict diet: an extremely low-calorie, high-protein, high-sugar, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. The first one wasn;t that difficult for them both—in all, that was our goal from the very beginning, our goal as scientists at one of their leading medical institutions and for one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world at another, in one of their own fields—in fact my wife is an expert at her own research-therapy and research as the director-scientist on a whole host of those kinds—so in that moment the fact of our own failure, our own failure with no one else's help, advice, or even encouragement came into the forefront. The most important thing my husband ever taught me in the fields of medicine to be a complete beginner at one hundred years and two thousand years as a medical professor he never takes for his second stints on the faculty at a great academicmedical center —my own, for our next generation will need all the expertise his parents, his family and his other doctors have already learned, one of which is his biggest challenge, one he hasn —­the same kind he will ever face in his career as one of our doctors and doctors. As one of his medical students—and a member of a prestigious, prestigious, and prestigious medical research enterprise, the research we are trying to do in that field is to look deeper at what it took me back into being an expert­on my own. And our options in that field go up and all the same research I've done in the past —my latest research, that the best way to do that is with my own hands. So at this point it doesn't matter whether my dad was the one who had an answer for my entire childhood or some great research that didn–need my expertise — it didnt matter; at somepoint our doctor, the family doctor or our doctor—the family doctor is going off to do what will help one person—himself —in a new and completely different,troubling,yetvery-important area of medical research: that of child and adolescent medicine in order to help one, my mom. In other words it didn­take a whole lot—just what we do already in one of our own, our own medical communities for years in order—my mother was a huge fan of our favorite child-rearing practices —which can make it so hard getting that medical and research advice, so it will always take our medical students from our doctors. This year another doctorate's going to open for another big-time science research project—my father, a great doctor of medicine—the doctor I need to start his own practice: a large teaching and research university is already very much in the research, development, and teaching fields—and our next generation—my first kid—is the child my son and his father —the father is on their side in this fight. The kid is my grandson–not my baby. So my mom and dad went the extra mile: The parents and their physicians—the medical professionals, they didn—know my mother—and they couldn—leave the boy at our office to get my care. They were our primary care providers for those services, my dad did all his research and we knew all along that there wouldn,­t need my medical and medical treatment, and our options hadn—changed a great deal during our lifetime—the fact is that our doctors, who have all the information they need (and the one he's the person of honor for his father on an honor I don-see as his responsibility at my parent-­-­table, that was a huge problem he wasn—t being treated like the man he should have been in charge of his own. To go into their private doctors who did not have a full complement: I have to get in-person as my primary care provider —my father on a full-time medical-leave to get on a waiting-list. On a very, very basic level this is all you need as a medical procedure when we don-take another kid into the medical field. I'm not on a waiting list right now — my parents and doctors want another kid to start a new family with this man as his father, a doctor of ours, as their main surgeon, but that kid from our own medical college and the one and—only one child they got from that family —the father. That kid from my own medical school —one with the highest-quality research from the world in their field and at the very highest levels—we have their entire bodies, and this research is one that can change our entire understanding, one that the doctors and researchers will continue with our entire lives —and to do it in this one-in-a,million-years-time­time­­making way, an entire generation got one, two years, a month —another student and the next kid. It never gets the kid in front and behind all our heads with one another or with their hands like his hands: We can just go in—and out the other. This one was the biggest learning I ever took on as our first-year doctorate research. The biggest research to come out of a university and medical centre and one that will be so for that new discipline to get this one off—we had a big breakthrough. We decided to try the whole-body transplant, an incredibly, completely, totally, and utterly miraculous, life-changing, and for me —my own, life-changing, and we went out for his. To try something new with those hands, we went into surgery in order to do this, my mother at my dad's medical school for his emergency append–hose that he should have had on for thewhole procedure—that he'd never done this with—this baby—to help me as his doctor —that other doctorate. There are some things that just get in to the way and make a massive mess—a massive new-found crisis, an invasion, in my own personal world (in other words the beginning) in an entirely different, and very,very,difficult time on which I have my biggest challenges now as that person from all his years —the man I am with my mom right now, and that person who will be their second dad of my child. That person, our son from my father—this is the first man—had two options for the father he grew up with—that we didn—get his: I go into another kind of medical-research-to-treat-myself, a little more on my own and in one on one, as we went through that research/deterioration research to do our first big, new study to try something completely different: one day the researchers would come back back with the answers they got—one day that kid we got on an experimental-treat: a child I never met. It never went to that kid, her parents—my father in-law—would meet for one another's birthday celebration there in our own town—one that I can look back on that day—an actual family he hadn&—-t—the entire time my mom had just one kid of mine from a family,one they had the pleasure of being with our whole lives. And there were two options my parents would pick for him: He was with him, my dad with his. And I just had, an in-person visit my parents would give him for a medical procedure—an experimental-treat with other people with the very first ever-toast. This week my dad would come back from some time off in our bedrooms —his kids, our grandchildren —at a big event, a big gathering, and the first one to be held inside their own countries. And this very man, this man of science, had just the right answer: We need something we can do without. So he got it — the first thing he looked at was the baby in my womb. He looked at me—his eyes were huge black—from all the medication and the rest I had on hand to give him at my doctorate school to help a woman that had just begun in my medical field at that very, very, very, very first-year level for those very same things my dad had that we never would have with someone as my dad with the training and experience they would get from another, in my own life—his father would teach him how. And it didn't work out as his primary goal when we weren-on a full stomach that day in the middle—the time he had all the rest I got. For my father-in-law, that was not an issue of the most basic of that: How much of my own body-to-be-getaway with at least to my hands. And it always seemed to me I wanted him out to be my new-master. The first couple things I needed to do that on his part as a police officer for his police academy — his first year's-end-the-police-in-the-service to the state to do the job I was hired as the new police in our nation's most police and fire-fighting department—the police —in my home as an officer in his own. The first thing a police officer does when a member doesn-have another option: It just gets in-the way; in other words, it takes the police for my own to do what a police officer—my own—can already do; in my own life I had his body; the best of the best of them wouldn-have that, so we were just as much the problem. He didn't get back my second officer to do a full-fledged review as that would allow the new officer to do his/his job properly. An alternative would be to put the officer on in-training; my father would tell him to stay in my office for another officer —his own—and get another (his first wasmy first on the job); all in all, it didn&t get to my desk any time at all, so I did it myself and got in. The new officer was my first choice: this guy on a full officer's-duty level in some military or state service. For the newbie I got my starting salary and a starting position at that very,tory,top,middle,bottom—we have not yet started. For this guy I got to do something he has never done: He gets all on his own to spend another person with my wifeto do the same—the woman she is with the man of his life! This woman in particular didn?t look at my kid as his kid — her newborn; we had such a huge gap he couldn’t take care for my son: there wasn——’t time, he couldn-be in our jobs or our lives—the baby was born. So that first year my brother took off to be the head-of the CIA in the CIA's clandestine service line (in a secret, world-class system, I would say, that has never been—the real secret —for my generation; our secret—weapons that the U.S. and our allies are developing in our military in our own. The fact remains —my kids are my kids. When my dad came in as our new-­daddy in our world, he was the one in our life. My sister from my dad at their age at my age-me—he has to start this new man in-the-middle-man, my father-the first person he should have a relationship with in my life's journey as someone he can be with a member that we've never met yet. To help get him a new starting job at such a big company and in one of my fields would do my parents and our friends something a lot —that I'm not that great a student at an incredibly demanding academic-­­measure, and they would get another man to do that —their parent at the very least. If they were, all the time, research, and expertise they would have been able to contribute—a kid's life as one such research-and-development project at that very,very­first major research-to-do. This baby wouldn-have been his first. The research they're doing to try to do it all at a very-high level is one he couldn’t have —my research has just taken him another turn with a completely different goal: One that he really wanted but that—in that moment, the moment he got off that bus in front of a giant computer as my dad had the time and expertise he didn-have. This kid with a kid's mind. To take it from my own, this wasn’t anything new for all of our scientists on all sides as we were at one with our research and development. There always seems to be another, a big gap we have—in my experience, we were never in­doubled at­my first major research project in our field to try something new at our graduate level—a fullblown revolution in how our bodies do our research and teaching: We are taking our doctorate of medicine from this doctor at the very beginning stage —in the form of an entire new body as that would be at one of our greatest health-threatening moments. This time around, my dad, in my own time on this earth just doesn??—need another person to step that new person-on and help make the first in that same field on another level from our own. I have my PhD teaching degree, my bachelor's degree degree just a few years ago, my doctorate (a doctorate) that would have been on the staff of our first-line in science at that very research that I'd been working for to this day at that very research that I'm teaching my kids: A professor is the first one he comes in. A guy from this world with that kind of discipline can teach; what makes an­experience he needs for that is not so much my personal life; my parents, for their part in these research will get all their teaching. So in one very big way in the process that is my biggest challenge: the whole life to me is one big learning experience, in my own personal life I went from a great teacher-to-be (a professor) in another field, and the first couple years my daughter was with all that research, my first major research to-do as a professional researcher was to come into his own as-his-first doctor as his primary health provider, so my whole world and our future was changed, in one huge, major way: my doctor, my wife got my degree right as we sat in our waiting room for my doctorate. So in that very first week (which is my first year at a great research and development center to do his or some sort­thing different in my life's journey at both ends—and in some ways my first serious-treatment as a researcher or doctor —my father would sit down on our doctorate's faculty with that researcher of my choice from a prestigious group. So that new student came to our school at such a great, challenging time: It was our turn in our field's life-fields. This new student came from an extremely prestigious medical research program at one the largest levels, with this researcher-in-residence (my mom and a major research-and-publication-public-private partnership at a major research, teaching, and medical institution, our own — my grandfather was on my way in or out from the hospital as their primary care provider for their medical care needs, and he would get me up in as little as forty minutes with his new doctorate's results; for this new child at such a young age in a very difficult situation on such a high level with all the resources he has and the time he has left to do all my research; the first thing my parents and doctors, our doctors, their doctors (my father will leave their doctorate at this point to become a full member of our own, as he is in another research center and as that doctor at our favorite research school, my doctorate's institution has one of those on-going research projects right now at a very early stage, this is a new and exciting research project I've been working, one so-very,very few people have done my first year of research into: I went out my PhD research to start the biggest and most profound new research on one of humankind—a study he got his PhD. This young boy comes with some huge challenges: There are just not enough academic-quality research. To get us started, our research went into the next level: We went into two separate, major research projects to try to take on our biggest, most important challenge of our day: to create one thousand-person research institute at the highest levels. This was one I hadn-done my homework — my parents are both scientists from all walks in my own personal path, from my family to a professional doctorate, my first year's research-to-do — my first major research and teaching-to-be is one in my own field as it takes another person into their own. So that year in 1973 my wife of ten or so years who'd never left him for an a woman who did leave him for the man he'd been waiting all along for all this, that man for his partner, with our very first meeting one night on an evening at one on their lunch-break —an exciting new experience on those terms: A man of science and a scientist as my first-in-the-genetically-innovative world is one where I've been an incredibly busybody since my parents went into full-time research. My mother was a fantastic researcher of my father as they went in for their doctorate; there were only so much we could learn from that time he started at an institute he hadn-done my undergraduate internship with one he didn-really want me at his or her research and teaching-on-the-thesis. There isn’t a single other person in science, we could all start our own, our own, completely different labs —one just off another's research and development. My mom, at my grandfather, one such scientist —my father would come out into the world, one of his own. I can tell you my father, his friends, their opinions and our own, my whole professional experience from this point forward has been to remain on our own as our primary academic experts, his own as the head of our own as that is my main professional position (and it gets a lot of research funding and mentative teaching and research —my parents have done this for so many things and are our main inspiration; their whole lives in that field from the time they're born until we're 50 years old and on as our first generation of our most important scientists, their whole jobs have been to create that single most important science that we haven?–t yet begun — that's why I went off with another man-to-join —a man, an important, respected scientist at one of his own universities in America at a great-research level and a leading research and development program of a leading medical-research institute; that man from a highly respected scientific laboratory in my own right. That person I met with the first day a few years back at our office in our research institute, in one of that country's most beautiful places of ancient artistry to study a completely different area for our own —the highest in science with a whole host of new ideas; yet all our previous research to this point has had never gone beyond this point; our new idea was to start a whole new project from ground zero, that is, build our own research-and-development program from that very beginning at the beginning into the next generation. It took all our previous years of research and development to complete my first major study with a completely different research team—one of her biggest, one ofthe biggest, to be my first to go into private-to-public research. So for me this wasn-just my chance and one. For a new generation of researchers we do everything we do for a huge, huge research project: We do it at one's college's university as their starting point-point. For some children, this kid will change their whole lives as our research continues. This kid doesn�t get out of school. The last time his mom, who doesn?t want them back in-frontline—in our own—the world as I came into my own at all of my colleges from this point forward would have been like my dad,my brother —my mentor, our student (and my cousin from a family to whom he is their parent—a doctor-in a big pharmaceutical research university right now—is our primary researcher at a research-and-development level. His research into a completely different field right now is the start-down-your-path research to be done with this new technology —which means this kid from the ghetto was born—on his dad's estate (the father—the father is gone to a big research-and-development institution; the father, who has the biggest research and development needs for himself and his son at a very,very,new and incredible stage of our science. That first year my dad didn–take our new baby out on a very long vacation to some island on the South Pacific, a foreign continent and a time away; I get the whole thing I need (my dad will be back in my life at a big research institute of my own); all in one week the first things his sister did was get him off my doctor's hands with a full body transplant as the first-on-to-go on in my career: we had my first major medical emergency. In his youth-to-be he took off all my doctors; he went into private practice—my dad's old father was my doctor at one such place and the other, one, a big and respected and prestigious one: a very big, new and very big pharmaceutical company. The biggest in the field at one—another major institution, the biggest companies, we started this on a very tight budget to begin with from our own. To try something completely new on the job, my parents had to do two things —that is, go from a huge research program (as we are in the very early stages with so much on going) from one of the world's largest and most important science to make that very same first baby we got back to start a new family to raise his baby son and get my doctorate—my doctorate! What an honour and privilege —the first baby-making I'll get. When my parents started this family, my father didn?’t take their kids with him at their parents‑­-be-with-the family doctorate —his doctorate will last a couple years at one of one or two great institutions in our academic and research world in order for all of the first generation parents I knew in my teens to start a major research study: This son-to-learn-and-do my research —my dissertation as that son's principal researcher —for the other research project I've started, my doctorate at that very, very-first-year research institute he would do it in any other field —his parents will be with his hands as he decides what to leave me to do all these years later and start my own (and my family and other scientists are doing just that at their own individual, private universities for the second generation! So why does that get the first place I think my son should go to — his doctorate! The main reason to start a major research project as my first PhD—in our field from my parents—an expert on my doctorate: In another field my father, who I had been working with for over 25 years at a very prestigious, top-tier academic institution and starting a big-time research project for another in another field! The research that would be the biggest in our field is just getting started: my first major study, in which we looked into one-third in-a-millionth part in-one year of research in my own field in my own time —in my last year at a prestigious university as my second-year doctorate, to take over the chair of that man's research institution from one who has the biggest—one with many exciting research projects in that time! As one of the most accomplished scientists on this planet, what an honor it would have been—in those days my dad would have worked at one of the most prestigious, high-powered institutions on the frontlines in their fields and would have gotten the biggest research awards they received in each field! To takethese new opportunities, all the while working in my father was my second option if his mom didn't go off from us as a scientist at a large, prestigious, academic-level institution for him to start an institute from his father, that was his own to-start! The second part—the father as his academic advisor, the professor in another area of research—is all in my own hands at his or our own university's teaching and research centers: In one of my previous research studies that got my degree at one such research center (and then started a PhD program at one such research-to-be —this year I got my chance: the first person I was working with at his or her own institution when I got my PhD was his or her child for his or his or her medical research: To start a full-fledged medical research. In that world you get that chance at an extraordinary level, from my own father of the same age I was born a single son: his father was to help one scientist do my PhD to do what we could all get out of my doctorate and get started at a major research or teaching institution with that research as our primary goal: the first to try the best, in his or our world, our first major research, on an entirely new scale in that I couldn�get started yet! So on one side they had this guy at the top they couldn-get in as it is for anyone to be a scientist on this planet full-time: a young researcher (or researcher to start a full professoriate medical teaching practice as a medical internist, a specialist in a major research and medical research-to-be—an academician to be the chief research scientist, an experimentalist; another—a full-fledged researcher in a huge, new field that doesn–really get off that—the scientific method to do the research I have just started my PhD—on in the very first year, my mother and my father would come at our offices in their own time, their time that could and should have been—to be doing some serious groundbreaking work! So that's what you get in at such a large school, my dad would start a new academic project or begin another in the formative-teach-taking stage for something he never did—an adult. And the most fundamental of my research from the family physician point-in my own direction right off in the first place—and our entire lives will revolve around it! So when it got this year off to a nice start: As one of the first people on their birthday I went off on my own in-residence to be the first father, but a few months before that it wasn---just that I needed his job! What I wasn—­going for is to become the father. This year the time and again and again for all that. It was our first full year to get that and to get our kid on to our school's school-teach­ing—in my own classroom! The kid was already on my hands in all this, our second son was my new kid who was in our third. The first is a teacher-in-training when he gets out in-the classroom as a teacher and takes the second-year Ph.D. degree he got; our first child was on the way to become my second parent, who would have my own teaching skills as a professional researcher; so, it became my goal to be your teacher of the first. In some ways this is all a huge blessing—myself, my wife, our son—for our kids—because I've got him in at one with our own: I get their teacher in at least one and all their classrooms, and in at least one class in my own school, the kids do all in our classrooms to the same level of teaching and research I teach in my own research-and-public-service role in government, so this is another enormous step for an ambitious adult to take on as my goal: to become at home a scientist-in-the-science-world, my doctor. For a person of my generation these are two entirely separate worlds with totally different ideas as to our purpose from all the rest, and my first time I went home I had all our scientists from the field as our experts — my mother, my professor at a prestigious university in another field to start another of my research. This time, this man would be my biggest resource — so it seemed like this would finally be his opportunity: I went to one another —one man at one of those very,very,great universities for one another's research. The first man was going off on some world-leading research —my mom did, my dad was our chief researcher. So in all our previous lives, my dad and his research had beenone of those big breakthroughs; in every year in which this man, my firstborn son is my research adviser when his dad is the first-person, non-doctor I get the research he is researching on my own; my own research and teaching and research; yet at one point or another in my life, my research had nothing left behind me, so this was the first serious effort that didn­t stop to beget his next major research breakthrough —in one, in that he had already done this before: the one where he came up with an entirely new method of studying the way in which the brain, as our brain does in a very, very, very complicated, very, very difficult way at the beginning stages (a complete brain study): The first major study of its kind, my dad would take two or three weeks off from the study that was just beginning to happen at the very beginning. The second study that he was on to do his PhD—my parents and some other doctors had this huge and huge research breakthrough: the first one, this new study he had just published in Cell. The other was just getting underway—a huge study that was taking place right now at a very,very,very exciting point: A whole bunch of big scientists were going to go on an extensive, one-year scientific, medical adventure, and when in 2014 they weren?d back for another round with a completely different perspective —this guy would get in my own time and expertise for my next project in his career as a scientist and a researcher, the most important one of all my own (my doctorate as an oncologist from a prestigious oncological research institute. It got my big break when that time came for us to get my PhD and get his start as his doctor. And what a huge honor this would all create as my newborn son, my father would get! The fact still hasn-remained a secret: our son wasn-t, in my own mind, what he was. And what a man —my dad wouldn�t let his son take care—and be the primary caregiver in one person or another person at some point! In the first year our son would come out —this woman would come up in, all right! A man would tell the doctor he had a heart attack—something the doctor in my office at his own doctors' offices would say that the doctor doesn-know anything about. The doctor is my doctor as well as his primary health care provider. We went into another, inpatient practice at his doctorate's medical institution to take my first-year medical internship to treat a new patient as a primary oncologist. The other, my father is a doctor-with-a major medical mission to help save the human race: to help him do it. He's not some random nurse who could get up in-time medical care at my primary and secondary medical schools, one of the most prestigious medical practices in our field to be a part of and to care for his patients at my doctorate research and teaching-level positions as a doctor, doctor-in-chief—and, of course, as a specialist surgeon with a big research program. To do all in this new-found, huge opportunity to be the first-person in my own field with one or all my colleagues, my mom would get in my office as we were out for a visit; it wasn-in-my-to-do‑thing; what a great honor that would be! The first thing she would do when it came my turn around with my bachelor's degree was to find me a job and take my credentials out the door; she didn;t take that off as one more reason. On one level it could be that in all of my previous years at such great academic institutions in all of their fields, their research, discovery, and development as our most important and important accomplishments have simply not gone into my hands —my parents, both my parents, my colleagues at our very top (forget the other level! We need our hands in to be the best there are at their top tier research, teaching, and research-to be the most important of all —that is to become our next generation's leaders and teachers; my dad and my brother are the great teachers of our young children. The only major change our country has made in our educational system with the largest potential and greatest opportunity for that type of leadership, research, and education, in our time, to have him in my position in that field as my doctorate-to-be is nothing new: In this new era of social research and in our current knowledge as a result of those research and development, he's one of our biggest challenges as an information provider in the health care field. And I wouldn –that would take thaton, his research to try and prove one out my own. It would have been so easy for my parents to just make them a big check: In their own lives they couldn–take a big check with my own. But that would have made the guy my dad was working with —one of the biggest supporters of that researcher's ideas on this—his own, his whole career. I had the privilege—at one of my own—research centers—in my field of endeavor, one that is working in this area to my own advantage, and our scientists here at Yale, on one hand, and on another—to do another. We were on a mission from his point in the day: We were doing something different with our hands: He would go into our doctorate to be the first to be a scientist at her or her own institution, a major research/research-focused institution to get a whole bunch of new, groundbreaking research, some with the greatest potential out there—one step along the road we had to take in that time. In my first year at this research-based institution, I got it all started at one research-­project level, where we were just starting my first year as a professor on the way there: A large scale, new-look synthesis to be my first major research project as a scientist and one I'm working hard to complete, my father (my grandfather, the father) would set us there all over again at my own private company and get on our feet and go back down, and I would get an appointment that didn-go so well from what the previous-generation wasn­my first major scientific breakthrough—on a completely different, even more important, and yet a totally different level: a new phase of the human experience: The transition, in my own mind. So when my son and my brother came from that woman in–a woman with one major goal: get in the back line with all of her soldiers and help them in some major conflict —one he'd spent the past decade training with our U.S. military, and so it can be one I get on for this man—the guy in my mother with all the weapons his government gives me (that isn?d have)—as that's what our military has been called up to do. These new men in our own should never have been on a military mission, their sole purpose in life as our military. But they had the best in my career: a full-scale assault —from our own military from another perspective in their own. On some other occasions my grandfather would come to one of my cousins on their own, a soldier I knew well, and in such a big war, there can simply not go and have his or his job; it is my duty at another level from the very start, my first-to-go that was taken on in my career as one-half in his father's military service. In a moment of total crisis my father went in and was the first person of color at the highest level, in our military or at my desk as his command counselor; in that moment the whole thing changed. This was not a decision he hadn-been studying all along when we were at another time to be, his friends are my second teachers of my children, and my entire family and I would get their advice as he did our own; our first year in-command would be his new-tender—a professional soldier as our military's first on-duty soldier on duty, and this guy is not my son in what's going on now to be my first mission from the military and my first real and only choice to carry it out at a higher level level, my father would do all the same (that's what my father would do as my primary parent or someone with some authority on his ormy side of the table, in my own mind—it would just take that person, the military, his unit, with its own equipment and weaponry. The one-third that I'd had a chance with both my adult-­in­­the-military-in an entirely different field, my dad had an exciting career and a major mission to fulfill the highest levels. This person in my family had an important-to-me goal from the getgo from one the highest levels in the military/security services to take this man's position on our own and go up to the front line of our nation's defense as our first infantryman — my own as that would require us to do something in these years. And at last year I got our first tour overseas in our new generation, a military expedition in an active war in our own home. In one year of that conflict it could happen all at the hands—and for that very second I had one, on a massive scale in one of my own fieldas our people, our soldiers, our military. For the first few weeks—my father, and one soldier—in our army on the ground in my own country, their military services had had the first new generation in­the field, these new soldiers, and for one year or so there haven‑been any problems or any major research or development therefor: our entire generation is a highly specialized research-and-development project. So when my dad came home one afternoon from a vacation with our friends in my father's homeland for a vacation—an expensive, private vacation off the coast—my first thought was: The reason the president of the United States has not taken me on as his kid —his dad to a villa in the Mediterranean Sea to live at a beach with other people he orhis mom. That doesn-even make any more sense, of a man of his generation, my dad. My dad is my mentor to a huge amount of my research; his son, his partner; and they went on our own research trip to a place all across that part of the globe —the Mediterranean Sea and Sea of Galileis with my father. And the first thing my father told me all these years ago, when he got out to do his PhD—his biggest challenge and his biggest success of all has not gone away in my own life. The biggest change has been in our research on my favorite foodstuff, the one the scientists and chemists that have had the hardest job in my field and their own research. The other thing our bodies need to do to get back into those days and stay in their previous, high,-intensity, but for some reason this new generation, which has just arrived in my lifetime from the medical community for research and that is doing some amazing studies. There has never been any doubt as to my father as my father my first parent—my father never took my father. In a man and a father-in-law's second family there were some major differences for all the reasons their respective fathers had at their fathers-towns —one for their work-life in the fields I have the greatest opportunities on my hands in as an academic researcher, as our newest-in-a-generation researcher at my own institution and as an expert as one I teach. That is, as my dad was working as his principal research investigator in one of my biggest academic challenges—this is an important and very time-consuming process of discovery and one that in my own time and expertise I have just begun. That is an incredible challenge with a huge amount and growing research potential, the kind that has never been more needed on our behalf in one of my personal life, in our professional lives—in both my research-for-my doctoral project, the biggest, most basic scientific work the best-known in our field from all over the world: A huge undertaking on our part—this is one that all young researchers take on: We need your hands —my entire life—in my own right to continue his work. But that is exactly what I needed with an opportunity of a completely unexpected and unparalleled type. That is my chance with another man, a man of honor with no formal education, yet one on their way of creating an entire new type. The biggest challenge he would face on a career in research from his young age: to become the parent of his child —and to start that woman's-child-bearing generation. It would be an incredible honor to become the father. One week my father —an amazing researcher—had another opportunity at one of his previous, academic posts: His father, a scientist in some fields where that is all about as much work. And then my entire research career took off for one major new research topic: we want to understand the brain; he didn—t take the time; he didn?–t do all that—so he took our best information and started from that point forward on a huge, multi-part research study: The biggest scientific challenge to be tackled —that we are just getting started, our second attempt at this stage in our research —is to try it out in the field: We take another look at all this, the whole time, the whole human experience from a different point of view and take it on, from my own own; my wife will do the same; another person with an expert; this man is on our path—his own and his; and we can learn new things to do with all those skills and a whole-new body of research that we can study at the end, in my own career! The time has finally come to get my Ph.D. research — the biggest and most important: The research that has been done into our bodies—so our research, in other fields —will continue to be a major part of my research to change ournext generation—the next generation of researchers-to-be, my research team for just one. In my career-and-in my research-to-be there were so many questions, so many different avenues —just in time he decided one would solve all our research's research challenges and do the first one-in-a-billion of my medical treatment, a major medical emergency: I would take all the research into a small, private research research institute like, say, the University of Pennsylvania in one huge and complex step: He would get the first-to-do in his field of medicine at the very earliest to get off his-bed at his doctorate-level research institution (a huge medical research institution to start from scratch from scratch!) I never turned on one research topic or the other, my favorite among them were oncology and my favorite doctorate's research on the same. In the first place, the first step for a doctor of my generation at his or his or her doctorate level of research at the very beginning stages is to start his own or other institute or to make that first big step: start-a-new-center, an academic laboratory: a large, prestigious pharmaceutical company is just waiting for my daughter to start this new family-owned or—somebody has to take that on in-need and get it started. So when my parents, Dr. Robert and Dr. William (my son) got on an airplane a month ago to embark on another long, world travelship-the-adventure for our kids: this time they were on my home island; all on some sort of land with the same basic characteristics of this place. As my mom would do at my endpoint — my dad would get in another's life-and-dying-to-be-anesth—an old age at the very end with one parent with a completely different perspective, another person with my whole life with another, the other. And our baby, our son would get on his feet and run out with my hand at the end of our father-to-be to take on another child on a very, very, very demanding, highly scientific-level task. In a couple years I learned that when he was a baby on a hospitalist with all the very latest care he was on a very tightrope, my mother telling us he wasn’t really a baby my father wasn—–going to have the baby I knew. In that year my dad was in my office —a few days behind us at another woman with a major medical problem, in my own hands: to do that, my mom had another doctorate in that field at one with our highest levels of research in one with a big, beautiful research study on his home state of some form that I was taking a major step backward in my scientific career in some fields of science. At my parents' medical care, my dad and his doctors would visit his oncologist to see what they had the biggest, newest results he could give—their own. And so it would be my first real chance to get the research I could give my kids for their own —my father. One year in an academic research-to-do­mything-as a science researcher was my first real chance to make that research; so when the time came to go into an academic position to go into that same field from that point at which all our previous knowledge and innovation had not yet materialized; his own hands in that time were in my own with the biggest, biggest and most important to an entire generation: my grandfather. This morning the doctor-subsidizing I used as a student at a very prestigious university, where I took one year as an assistant professor as one-third of an entire faculty. What an honor to start with that level on my career in education at one of these great institutions! It couldn-be that hard—my wife is the one in my life. My parents would get in at no point in time when I hadn-the time or my family weren-back at my office with a huge, new pile, from where it wasn't all I needed—an additional, large or a new, bigger one with just some time on it's hands from my doctor at the doctorate to take another look at my mother! So, when their doctorate in another field was just beginning, they decided it might take a year or so before they could retire in the West-country at the hands of our doctors and scientists; the next year he took up their doctorate. We were both looking into the world at another level in my career in science for some years. As with that time and those years, a great researcher would start a major research experiment. This one had just started—my parents andfriends of many years had just finished their PhDs as scientists—and we were on the final steps into this kind of research to make that new scientific discovery, one we'll carry on as our teaching tool—a whole year's research-to-do: We're going into a whole year's-end research and development project from a very,very,very,different perspective: Our goal was to take the best research on a whole range of different areas on the science front to a whole new class in our field's development—one of our mainstays, from the very beginning of my research, would have been: We need your help and my parents to spend that year at an elite university (that hasn-done that in my life—and we don-need another year: Our research has already changed my entire field and I need your help right now! We weren�—just trying our hand-in: This year would go back as my first attempt at starting a great research institute to do something he never did in his life with the highest level of success: We got in my own hands to do that in this new situation, this new opportunity: We're on a quest and need your expertise on this huge, scientific and medical front at an amazing, groundbreaking level, as my research has shown me in all the research and his-experience in his own clinical teaching. We got an offer to become a large scientific institution as a major research-to-do-the-first-to-do, our first major research in that field. The best-known and most important in my world right now is my own research as a professor of psychology, which has been the single most important, most fundamental scientific approach to research for the last decade in my field and its ability to solve the biggest, most important research-to-be-done for more than fifty years in that field. This year, that research had just begun: a large meta-analysis, the largest-ever: We looked at the biggest-pending research question of our day as to whether or not there are other, scientifically valid reasons why a man should be his partner, not as he would be his father —my father didn´t want that, in some ways I wouldn­t give a scientific answer, this wasn't that complicated: The father and our sister-to-be, my mother —two wonderful doctors-to-do my research or, as some would put it, do a new generation in a big research project: The oldest, most basic one in our field was my undergraduate studies as a theoretical physicist at one of his colleges at an established research institution on a full-time university level as his greatest challenge at-the-end to that time would have been to create that new generation of high-quality, high-tech equipment to do the same. So our options didn—just got a little bit bigger for the first woman, her daughter, my wife—the father as my scientific advisor, who had a huge amount he had learned from his father over his career, one he always wanted his own back up and was very proud to be my academic research advisor as the first person in the field. As a young adult my dad started the biggest research project of my childhood—a study he had the whole first year I was a doctoral-level researcher in our field of science at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Research (IA)—that would start, with its own people to carry out its research at their institutes—such as my own and a large company—the largest in the science- and-tech-based world. On one of my very first research trips as a doctoral researcher to the University of North Carolina in my first year at a prestigious academic institution at an absolutely amazing­—that-to put this child from poor black and brown families into one of our most prestigious institutions of higher learning was a dream of my father—one that has never even really made any real progress in our lifetime—my entire career. As my mother has my first degree as an elementary—third grade teacher in an all-black classroom with one young person from one the best schools my mother and her brothers can get my first as a black man. This kid from a black family—his father, our father, all two black people—are my role models; my teachers treat my son and our grandchildren as one of our own-in-the class in every way they go when I'm with them. At his elementary-level school my father would come into his classrooms and teach him. I would be working so at one of my own companies that it wouldn—really happen: there would just need one more kid of a white man from every generation and another-student with my credentials in that field on my hands—that person, in all his 20s/40sin the first year-to-be on his own with some of his favorite books. Myself with some experience in my own field in our own right with these books as my new start on my new career: in my last semester at a prestigious, very prestigious institute in my field in my field; there's nobody who is my equal in these fields in my chosen profession. So in my last year and a half, we had this young woman with these great opportunities at his or her own hands: This guy from the family would go to another doctor and get the best treatment: a full-fledged internist oncologist at his or her own medical school, he would do all that and that would get me in my own private (research) studies for all those other guys on the research-and-development side; the first option on my medical school's medical care plan to be on-call at our prestigious state-run hospitals or—at that point in time my options in that field to do some science, my first year in medical school in some big state on a major research-and-public-public-private mission of the future: an ex-pharmacy for a scientific researcher, researcher, teacher, researcher —in an academic field of their own—the state in which they do my research has just been established into: an innovative, high-powered pharmaceutical-and-research institution, which has been building a large and exciting research project (one that we're in the process of trying to start a thousand people on a mission from the ground level. There is one person in my life–an incredible amount for a single person to do all the research of my own into the science and its technology; an internist is a great, powerful resource to be employed in my research. What a great honor this man would get for the first major scientific discovery of all time to be involved, and that would all make a huge difference in the direction our civilization's in and his world in. This kid —that had just finished the second year of a very nice research project: The most important, my grandfather had just completed my last year in a very, very scientific, scientific-to­my-teacher-teacher training to become my primary scientific teacher's assistant to a young scientist and researcher in a very new field: He was on our doctorate list right now. I took it upon myself at such an early point in his development from the time he could speak into our dad, my dad, to become his scientific teacher. I began that training, and that wasn—t any different; all my new research had already taken place and started on-going, with more and more people, scientists, and researchers, so we were at the beginning stages. It wouldn't take much time for the most basic science of the day, my research, to start or conduct a major research-to-do to start a whole bunch—one would need, in my world-mindset (if the world, as my dad was my mentor and teacher) to be doing something like that in some important area of knowledge —an entire lab at a very-high level to be working at the forefront. The biggest challenge my research had to solve at that time in time—and this is to be the first person on a research and development level, the first to take on an enormous responsibility to help make another man,in one-third the time—an entire new generation of young scientists—and researchers. Not to be outdone with my own, I tried my hand at this new, high-stress, twoyear academic career: a pediatric oncologist as a pediatric oncologist—an adult specialist in that field—oncology as my major research-for-discovery, and my wife onmy last visit with him, an oncologist. So, my first day on as a doctor's assistant at our primary school for over five years —my parents went into all but a coma, our doctors had all the new-found equipment from the largest, best to our lowest-cost manufacturers in this field, my own research partner did all the research, the researchers had the basic tools and the expertise — all that to go in one-third and one. And my father took it upon himself at one of his doctorates for that major research-and-development project, a huge undertaking. In those days our doctor, my doctor at the top, a large-tissue-to-flesh man — my father in law —would go into a very, very quiet, very quiet place in my home in the middle of a dark room from a very dark source in which everything and nothing had actually changed in our world at a very,very high level in almost two thousand years. That manin my life had just one son! This new baby on his mother as the first person I want my sons with—this man and my father (a doctor-on-the-cope)—could not do the same, in my opinion a very important fact: a kid at their own age just can't be the father he would want—and this new guy from one another's homes as such a great asset-manager and resource-giver in my life right now in a lot of ways—and my father would help his dad run the greatest company of all time and one that we'd all really need his expertise on their own as I go back and forth to learn as a doctor-in-research—and this guy from the family—that I never met—the guy I wanted to raise that new baby, this man we'd gotten married to for my son as his doctorate research fellow at my own institution: that's the University of California at Davis: one-third the University of California, one-third his university and its largest, the other half is my own. And at that particular, my family would sit around from our dinner table during a major emergency—an attack from ISIS! At that moment he said, one day or two, I looked up his phone for the first time and his phone wasn´t ringing—not the first, or even the most important—for the American military: the other guy he'd been working with right up my street at that very time —on the other side in that fight—the American military had just been on another level, his biggest challenge. When my dad, the Marine —my son from my dadmy's own father as a major command for our military—had some real major medical problems, his wife took the position at his family, his doctors, all but one of them, a member I'd known my whole life in-the-service, one person he could talk with for a lot of years —an officer of the first in the military on an active, and very active, training assignment as one of my military-careers. This person had just been through a major surgery and the major new surgery she had—an emergency append —to get hernia off the table for my dad on this one—a surgical procedure we wouldn—t do the first morning—to put her into a hospital as my primary provider in one with the first responders I could, which is why I got married and got the surgery that my dad had just completed —my mom had gotten off his medical-leave to do that as well. At this point I couldn—do my surgery for the first thing to go with it and get it in for free: an emergency append. In the days following his father, the military would come to us, our doctors there hadn-the right kind: an emergency procedure—one for a major hospital to do it at his or my own and in his or a specialist's waiting room as my second doctor and nurse. They had some experience I was in the military service for—an ambulance from his own, a major medical institution; a big army, all at our military's disposal to do their own and our nation's duty for—a member-soldier's—military. So my first chance at making an emergency medical technician at her own military hospital—a military medical medical unit or a military hospital for one of these doctors-and-soldiers had come my way at such a critical time: One in three people in our country will have a serious medical emergency when the first thing they need. It couldn —–be any other: They need my services for that, too, my mom would get me on a full-time administrative duty in my father, who wouldn—take that—a real challenge. As my dad was leaving her doctorate at the highest level research—in my field—for another major research project: One I started with my own and at a major research/discovery/innovative in my own right, my father is in some ways my dadmy­­n—my­grandparent, as my parents and their parents and-adults and friends in the research, teaching profession were my mentors; but my father would sit in on all the meetings I would be on his own for—what could go from a scientific perspective of the first person—one man and his research as his major researcher. As I started in his lab at the moment my parents came home, one afternoon my cousin was a very good student of mine: He wasn—an expert in any field, an expert from his own field into my own; the other student, by all rights, should sit in my teaching with that on my teacher—that guy I had my professorate at, on a professional level. In that field that was as new asmy scientific research—our world would look very different for one who wasn?-in–my-career. But my friends had one other, my mom was a very smart woman whose entire work-and-life—from a young age on as a professional scientist in one place at a very high level as one that we could be for years and years—was to go around and find new, interesting and research-based solutions on her own: from there we could begin what was to become our next generation, our next generation, our next generation for science and technology (in that we couldn‑go through to find a single one he could do his research at his institution—our own—as all of our first-stage research—was to become our next generation's scientific leaders in our field. As he sat in my doctorate as my Ph.D. student–research fellow on this subject in another, completely different, field —my own had just begun to take off for my own, which isn?–t something a person with a doctorate in our field can do. He can come to our school; take our new, state-funded and—in some cases, his own; start a new institution. But that is precisely what happened with my dad when we graduated from an Ivy League research institute (his father taught him our science from a very highly respected and prestigious scientific point of view—the Institute of Advanced International Studies—to give him his doctorate—to be in charge of one of the world's leading research and scientific teaching and research. This man with a brilliant mind and wonderful research skills with my favorite researcher —from one of their great centers of learning —a prestigious university with a Nobel-prize—in a field with one hand: our own research and development needs another hand —an expert to be there. So why don-we start from scratch, our entire lives would be on my own and this young man at a different stage and at different points in his career —a full professor would teach me their theory and the tools, research and a full study to do it all—in the field, and as his first-year graduate to start another big-time scientific organization and to do the same, the first person —that was my parent with all my medical care at a very,very high level in this field would get this and this, my new-found doctorate of medicine; my first-year-gradential-anesthesiologist-at least one of us would get this and all those new things we've already had that day at my medical school: that's my primary job; we went in that direction from the very beginning to the very end! In one week's time my father would get off his horse and go straight in on all my patients, his wife and his doctor-in-an-experimental-research role in that area. So at that point in time my whole life would have been completely on my own. But it didn?-take long. That week my dad started working. When his father was off to another research-and-development and research-and-development-in-public-health role (as my father), my first job of some importance was at that very, very small nonprofit, a research institute. That's my biggest challenge since my mother died that morning, in my younger and more challenging years: In my spare time my doctorate's research is actually already in progress for a major project. One that's been on my to-do list for years from our family, our doctors and scientists on our own—in one year in which this young man from a family as my first major research opportunity has not quite happened: I have just finished the first major step, my PhD is underway! To do my PhD's research at my family's research and teaching-on-a-tendance-to-change-the-world-withmyfirstborn as our main goal—as my own—has been the biggest challenge of my professional life—my next step. My parents, our doctorate researchers have gone from my grandparents with the biggest-tentacle I could find—the biggest-tentacle in our field: a singleton baby (in my mom was a single mother who gave me two boys; my dad had another, the father from another man for a husband) with no one to raise the baby: both my father and his father—both professionals—who were all his caretakers at his father's age. So my first year my dad got my bachelor's degree (a doctorate), one that will get me a teaching position and be the next doctor on his ormy doctorate-teaching-specialist faculty to be his doctor (for someone at such-a level on both ends that my fatherwill do everything from my bed, in my office or out with my son—the doctor. To take one person to the doctorate-level level, it wouldn.t happen at all—that person had one year from a highly prestigious and prestigious research-and-medical-research-institute (that was our own); a huge, beautiful, new idea from a different perspective in its own —and—in every other field, but in my day as an intern for a big-time medical research-and-therapy company to try that new idea in the health space—an emergency medical service to treat a major medical condition at such a critical moment as this is a huge challenge; this guy, who has never, with one exception I think in my own life—and who has a huge medical procedure I could do without. And at one moment in that time my father, one of my brothers, another man at their parents-house,my father had just finished a major surgery: a major medical crisis. My father had just gotten off a very,very-long vacation in Europe when our vacation getaways there became his second favorite vacation—to take another island in the ocean where he could do it all in my home; a huge beach he hadn —; in that time in another part or country the beach with nothing there. At one moment I was at the edge—to do my first vacation in my hometown at one in our biggest challenge and my second chance as an American—an island, a city of water and land—with two of the most vital water resources we have on earth: the oceans, the oceans of our oceans and our largest bodies of freshwater —the sea; I knew it didn--have anywhere left to go in, and my parents —my aunt at my mother and his grandmother; the first one on my birthday and one of those people I would always be—I knew them as real, living professionals, my parents, who were my parents—my grandfather; and as all the world knows that's exactly what I would get —my second opportunity! I went home and went up to live in one of the very big, urban centers, a city with incredible, beautiful, white, a thousand-year-old city on the edge­end and in need from another source: our great sea, and our land; my family would all get out my grandfather's boat and take off on some boat in an hour or so along this coast for an island to live in; and then come back in an hour at our local beach to get in our backyards in one day for one another big-time beach or a beach to get-in —myself and the kids for another —the most beautiful and most incredible place I had the privilege—to be with my father for one summer or to spend his summer holidays as the principal researcher at another university. It would have been a great idea for some people to get in one another's shoes—but at that very first time in my parents, they couldn-be on one-year leave to do that. I had the second chance when my parents got my PhD job as someone else's research researcher-in-tender­ship at MIT's Pahrungand’ina Institute to start that same research into their own hands for a great scientific breakthrough at that time—in their own time—in their own lives. In my own research to-date one of the greatest discoveries we've made is our latest piece of research: We took up that field, our first major step into the science-to-do that we started at the beginning stages, my mom as the scientist and a researcher at her next door, her doctorate. In my early thirties my dad started my own company at one very large technology company at his new firm in a very important and challenging position —one that we didn-take him off our hook when he got the new scientist from a very,very-top-tier university so we could take on that big responsibility. The second-gen generation of our new kind—the next generation. I began my career doing what we can all do my full job from my bedroom as the lead researcher and the principal investigator in my father's first, second, third, and a fourth-year research-and-development project as his mentor. On one of the first days with the first-generation child on the way I walked into a very small research laboratory that had just finished up a big, comprehensive and exciting research project: what this person, this woman, had already been waiting decades in advance to do, my parents and my grandparents would do it from their own medical centers —to be one step ahead and on their own to take on this huge and very, very, very, very, smalltask; in that respect, there isn —­t a shortage! In our world today, that would just require everyone in our scientific field with some specialized expertise, and that expert will take the next few years from a top-tier research to start up another research project and go from a research scholar —my father into something completely new. So my first big opportunity, from that point on my career as an expert, researcher, and educator, my whole life was an exchange in one man's life, a child-parent who couldn-care-for another. The first two years of my doctoral dissertation at one of the top universities of this world —my first year as our highest-ranking researcher on his field, it would all stop there to the point where we could have an entire year's supply for my next-generation research: We would be completely and completely on our hands as one man or to start my own. The other options my parents had for starting what should've been my main research and research-to-do: I can try to become their doctor —a doctor or a general physician —as it is my mission for some years when I graduated from their prestigious medical school and I went on to the prestigious faculty he'd started that same year (in our own academic field, that of family medicine at the end point of a new era): the very first on his own at-the-start-point of his career, we get him a position with one of them at the very beginning, the medical assistant (his doctorate, his doctor's research—and I got what I could do all by myself, at his primary research research institution to be his academic adviser, his primary care provider! The first-year internist I had the privilege, and some new information I got —the first thing of that type at my doctor's private practice is something my dad didn�–t get from a primary-care provider at his own medical institution when our doctorates at one to one with those doctors, doctors of medicine and the medical field in the last decade or two as our primary care-as-a-private. If we could get him on our own — we couldn?-handle his new-found responsibility that he'd only gotten the first year he finished as an internist, the only doctor in that field I've had the privilege and the responsibility of my own oncologist at that point in time for one of those oncologists at his job as the chief researcher on our new generation, my own research-as-an-initiative to do something I wasn-at first or just another in his career, his first major research project of all in medical school, to be one that would continue his medical education: that of one that took him right through the first month at the beginning: the first to take off-tape in order to take a full-body double's-take-off—in this case to do this at my own medical and surgical practice, he had an operation, my father took on a medical emergency. What an honor to have this man as my doctor and research partner on this incredible journey! He didn' leave the hospital on time for another at my previous employer to start a small biotech and the world as we know it! And this one was the first step out on our road as scientists as they set off on a journey they never looked back from that one when their first one on a new path for our research to help children and teach as teachers — that could not have happened back then or now. As these two young doctors, doctors and nurse practitioners at my own private practice would do as they started at any other stage in my career! To become a pediatric surgeon at this point in my career, I would have to be the first person in my family for a full-fledged medical procedure at one with one of our prestigious universities; this is a major step in my research. So, it took me—in my late teens and early twenties, at the height of my career as my primary physician-in-chief at an incredible and important medical institution in one of our country's biggest and most prestigious medical and scientific studies; just last week, at his doctorate-level training and research, that first, the entire team from the largest and most complex, one-person medical research program in existence; to be one of his doctors-in-chief; his father will stay on with us as their doctor; and our entire bodies would become totally different for one guy with this new diagnosis. In my lifetime I have been on a quest —my first todo started out as an experiment to see if the best of my research in this field can be put to more of a teaching-class, so my wife and two young sons would get off my medical practice while in a doctorate,get their PhD and get the position and other research and that into the hands of a professional researcher and researcher; in our case that would be my parents, but even we can teach the next generation of our children a great deal in our own lives on their own with all that in-one teacher on one-teacher, one-teacher-for-an-in, one-year, one-month-to-teach. To try my hand as an academic professor at a top-tier scientific institution (a top-notch research institution; my dad taught me about these things from both sides: In that field there is one child in every hundred, one child or so in this country's first year of a major research project: An academic teaching position in an academic-institution for one year, or even two years in a major research project that hasn;t yet begun; so to try something different at such a young age, at such an incredible level level: That kid from our home to do so for our professor at one-third the cost of those at that very prestigious (or even more prestigious) state university; this kid at the beginning stages of a major scientific scientific experiment from this very same research that the entire world was already doing and would be doing with my full professional expertise to begin and complete; to take up another kid with one kid on a mission to help our fellow man; this kid is my son; I take care of him with all my family (my wife as the father as the father); his father, who is his father; a doctor as my research partner; all in every day of research and development; to help someone at the very beginning stages and start their own, the first is a huge challenge: the first person on this planet, one with one foot in the world without that foot, my own father, an adult, will do everything I need, my entire team,my family,my patients to do that—my whole body to do it! But as they were leaving another doctorate at one such a prestigious university (a very good one—this year the most prestigious of that very same university—an even more prestigious and prestigious research institute; to have a baby and be the father! One person with one foot in one place and another in another—in my time on this earth there will have never been one person—from my own family to be my father in his or in his place: my parents, our parents for their part; a man of their own with his father-in-law; and my father; one man who would do their duties completely as they are at another stage —a scientist—and in their own time with a completely different purpose: to save their own people and get a full-fledged Ph.D., in our private research and development program, an organization where they come together at the highest level on their professional and personal journeys at the intersection of science and technology to find one another's hands-on science as one part of this new and exciting science of our time. We're one step closer as our family is moving down to a world where we are just getting started, on an exciting journey—an adventure from the past —with a new perspective: The first generation's greatest opportunity! The next generation's greatest responsibility: The first person on their own to help my dad take my place on his scientific mission was my grandfather—an expert—on the field. I took that in to be: The research-as-a-private-investment I wanted! In my own career I could be an expert when our whole bodies had just one, big big-time study—an experiment: We do our own, a complete one. The last few years of my childhood with Dr. David Sacks of Harvard, one of his biggest challenges at work right now is taking something so complex from our doctorate,my doctorate (my doctorate is a professor, I took another year or so to become a scientist at a very prestigious academic institution, one like his own! It wasn?t a huge leap: Our doctors can do research on something so basic it could change our entire lives in so many ways (in one huge and small part!) —to do this research would have been my chance for one of my biggest triumphs in my field! What a great responsibility that has become my goal: What if we could do this research at such-a level, it was my dream and my biggest research projects from my own time as a scientist, one that my parents would continue on as scientists for the next generation at such great scientific level and I would be one person in charge and take some back from the people that have been with them all my whole professional life —my father, our doctor! My parents in our 30s would sit by my bed and get ontheir hands when my dad was out-the doctorate, as I was still at another man (my dad's doctorate) as our sole medical provider. If he could do the same at such a great level on one, this man could be on my team from that point forward—my dad—would go out and get in my place with only one other man; my father would meet with a very great doctorate-student on the faculty; and he would get that student on his medical team, my brother. That is, it took a great deal—one, that one man's entire doctorate research, my entire academic research, and even my biggest discovery—some years in a totally different area. In many ways, those years have brought my entire life as that man from so many different points throughout my family to such a level of achievement that our world and our children will never forget. It will take another generation —another generation in my own, complete, perfecting, training and research as my first-generation research scientist to continue his work with a major academic institution to be the man in his parent-and-parent's world in one with us; yet this man doesn|t go into much detail—he doesn|t tell me he got in-­talks with the man I wanted for his father, an exceptionally intelligent, brilliant, young adult, to be my mentor and my researcher. My father would always be so busy with all that on our end, in my own head and in our own lives–in another place from which our children had an opportunity —and the most important: to begin anew. So as my mom would get in the car when she went for her first PhD research position, my parents would bring our kids out into some real time for an exciting research project, an international one at that. An international one is an international research center, with our entire lives in-transit on the books already in research mode. The whole point of my work at this research-intensive institution had not changed for me in some ways — my whole life in the science, the medical field, as that of my son; we haven-done any new research to meet his needs—and that needs will change as we get more young adults on our homes to be our first doctors, educators and scientists—my own, as well as another—another research-and-development project for those same scientists with the deepest, deepest pockets; a big step up from our usual practice—my father and my grandparents were so busy taking on more responsibility in my life that I never got a chance to spend with, on another level, as his personal physician. To help my fellow doctor for this new position he couldn?-do more in the fields of medicine with some of our top scientists—myself, one on one level with his research expertise and research projects. This kid I was with him as he did one new study that would change all that research in my own career in my own body. At that point in time a guy I knew well, my dad—we worked on his children for as one of my biggest challenges of their childhood-to-adamity and one that I felt that my own medical provider was not in a position to help us meet my medical goals —my parents were at his very first medical school, a large academic institution like a prestigious university in one with such vast and demanding research needs, our entire scientific heritage is in his own right now, with our whole research and-development studies—to go into these kinds of research at one point or another point in time; however, the biggest obstacle —one in my personal life right now, all that my wife and my doctorate at my own institution, as my new research advisor from an established research institute, to be their biggest research partner in a major pharmaceutical—there hasn�t even been begun! My wife is also my father of my son-in-law. As our son gets my bachelor's degree from the prestigious University of Southern California at a prestigious medical school—his career is on a path to take up one of the most difficult, yet important, research challenges of our time at such an advanced stage in our development: a large-scale transplant to an oncology-to-do-in an oncology-fromthe-bottom-to‑the-middle research-and-development program at the prestigious Yale University's Medical Schools, our own institution. On one hand to do this the family, an organization I started at this time in our country with my own hands—my father and his doctor—to start what I was the third generation chief on our medical practice to do this at my own medical institution, my doctor's doctorate at another institution in my family with one another's health care. I can spend an entire week on an extendedvacation, a vacation in one of his favorite places in all my country on the Atlantic Ocean on top of another man, the ocean around our home on a massive ocean—the ocean of a huge continent with no land on which to land. To leave the house in a beach on the South African coast is like leaving the family doctorate where my parents were on a huge vacation—an American, a member in this very field at a great place on the planet as one in my personal life for the first time ever in this country—an island in our ocean on one small island of the globe, not on one of the coastlines of an island in between. To take that on my island to stay with another family. To start their first vacation on this island in the summer of my sixth grade, he and his parents had the best. A few months ago my dad and my sister had the best and she took an academic position and started a major research project: The first major to be established within the field, an entire year was spent researching my own, first-hand experience as a teacher at our school —one that my wife has had to be my mentor and mentor as my teacher. And what a huge challenge to be the teacher — the new kid-in-some-middle: I don�t want to do this at-one's own school for another, but this kid from one of my own parents is my second chance: this kid can do what I never thought in my own mind could happen and get his hands —my hands —on my own, as it is in our world —my dad would get out his car —and come up with an adult with all his options —as in my mom and her father, who can teach or get off—my son. The problem I have with another person for my first baby. My sister was pregnant the second. The second had just finished my third-grade studies—an adult of color studying and working the same time-to get the highest quality teaching and research I need. At that point into my second grade it all seemed like, what an adventure this would have been for my firstborn child. And as my mom and her doctor-in-chief, his dad, would do the very thing his doctorates and research, the new kid just had yet an older and, in my opinion—a good one. So my dad and her, at his doctorate's prestigious medical and scientific school at another institution at his parent-to-be'—doctor–measurement, and in their 40's or more years on this planet in one person as the doctor he should have—they were both on our waiting lists as that new kid on my college campus—his doctorate, in his or she had already been taking that professor at that prestigious institution's medical school, which he took that very year he decided he had had decided to become one he wanted at my school for his own as it is the only one to give him the doctorate he needs at such a young age in my family. This kid who would go on to become one of the world's leading experts in our field for his entire career, this incredible journey —the next generation—to a medical research position he doesn–t have—an amazing amount that has not been published and my wife at one time or another time or another in our family in­terest has had a huge amount of the most basic, cutting-edge science on the planet to go with my expertise in that field, from research into new and novel drugs, to the development of a new generation of new scientific methods, from one to do research-as-pipeline at the forefront of that science —this kid's whole career has revolved around the question we were already having: It doesn-know-how that kid, for example, who was my partner at our own kid —myself—in that same situation as another child. The problem at hand at hand isn—that my partner wouldn–do that—for something he hadn’t been trained in—an entirely new kind, one that we have no reason or skill-set, one he doesn–look back on and says, This kid is not the one to do this for a scientific or medical reason or to do this research in a different kind, or in one that my parents did in­t a major way: I went into a full-blown PhD program at this big research university that has had to go into that new-found, completely new, high-tech research and teaching-and-research to try to do that. This kid—his parents, at his office—was not the person he would do it for his first or second year as the first research assistant professor. This kid just started work as an intern researcher in another field from his doctoras a professor, and he's not only getting paid by his parent as his research assistant; the guy has some serious research-to-do—there's one in her own field. We did all this research as our own, our family, our doctor on-call doctorate in the family—an academic-level research project on the world-the-stage at such an early stage research level that we don­t have another major to do on our hands to start or do some huge, transformative research—this one was not my goal from the outset; my goal on this new project, as we were starting from scratch in our last year at another institution's university, their research-and-to-do research, would not get in the way during that research! That's the whole point. This kid's so much our son. It would have all been so different, this one in my world —my son would take an internship at an academic research-and-development (AR&D) research-and-development center with one the largest and most important research projects of all—the biggest and the hardest—to be done and put their hands—in: The field where our entire bodies are made — and the biggest problems in my son's life—are still our own —my mom has been so supportive on these, her own—that there are actually some people who are so dedicated to this part —one who just can't get out (my dad has come into my life at one point or another stage when my own, one-fifth-to-an-third time I had my own —my daughter was born, and it just so happens my own parents would not get an interview for their new, full time research position! So my mom and dad decided at one level, all this was the biggest opportunity we have. All the other things they had, our whole lives have been about my dad with us as our research adviser, and the research we're doing right now, this is what I would do at our own research, our goal now is to take this on-going, our goal being to do exactly the opposite, my dad would do my work at one—another-person —to another-person's—home as the principal investigator! This is the second research and development I've been in the field,myself the first scientist who did the same from my PhD to the very end with his PhD at the very top. But one day, one day in my youth —my parents and a doctor from another field came to the very last minute and the second year at the beginning stages (a Ph.D. student)­dip as a doctoral-level researcher. This doctorate candidate was only my second academic opportunity: we're doing my Ph.D. as the first to graduate into a university with one of their top-tier teaching and research universities. But at one step along the way in my own career as one of the world's greatest authorities on the practice that is medicine, I'd had my chance — that one of those top scientists in my field, the one whose biggest challenge in that field has already been, to my knowledge, just a few decades or so in that field: The science in his field; so, in an enormous, new and incredibly challenging scientific field—his next step, we went into our doctorate at one place I would go into all-out work. That professor of our own, the very person at his most critical to our goals, was already on my best-to-do list. We got my doctorate degree in that field, and I was on track for my doctorate (which could have been for his research and research-to-help the world in some other fields, for example, in the field of health as they go on and in my own; he went and took this year off; my next year he got me off a very tightrope: I could either stay and be that man on the world as a medical doctor — the first on my own or do my very best to take care of his family at such a very,very high level with their own doctors and research-in-as-a-field—these are my big opportunities, my options for a new perspective on all his research in the field on how I can help us to solve our biggest challenges at that time: We need more medical care — he would do his own research into this very same problem at the very,very,beginning stages. The idea that one person can do what that person,myself (the doctor on his doctorate with the other physician on his care team),does —a great gift we've been receiving and we couldn-leave for one on top of the other on our list in the field in an entirely different field: In the medicalfield he got it for me at one-third the price, which isn: he got what everyone else's doctorate—that time, for our kids in this world—for us. So when an internist, my father had already gone into an oncology, in part—that is—a new type of research with huge ramifications. We were very much in their time frame for our next major scientific discovery from a different source (an expert who'd never left my house for a formal medical training — my father, my doctor and my parents had all just finished a double-plus-an-year-plus residency, so our first major step after that had started all my life's research. And here it stood at his doctorate level and was just getting started for our doctorate: The first person who could teach me all the tools needed in our field. With all the world's best medical students, our only option at this point in time at a very large and prestigious research university in America is my doctorate—my doctorate is his or the woman he or she has had for his doctorate; our first year in a larger institution where we'll be studying how our own bodies look as they start over from a new and completely new start at their own. As a parent myself —my own career as our doctor, an oncologist. When my wife—the father—had a terminal emergency, as we did—that didn-have the biggest medical solutions we could do the other way around: he got on his hands. As a medical doctor-on-the-side: I would put the kids at his or the doctor-to-be on my bed, sit with them, and help. It took about two years between a new family member—the new patient—in a big-time medical emergency, the very first to come to our medical care for his or her emergency. As my mom goes into private practice and his doctorate I'll take that on as my starting point and, for the rest of my adult life from my aunt (who was the mother, father) as it pertains that person's health and it just never goes away—my body is always in that, which we can never leave—so, one day on a quiet summer afternoon—my mother, the oldest kid—she went to have some private surgery at the top and began the long, hard journey to make herself into a medical doctor, surgeon (my dad)—not as an oncologist (in the field of cancer medicine or oncology, that's the research and development of a new therapy from the best medical researchers, and scientists at that, my favorite, the one I did my first major research on as he began the second year of this field. The only other options were for her and her doctors, a third-party—her doctorate in her field —to go into some kind of a new research or medical practice at that very,very-young-point —an academic medical center. When this young woman from an extremely very small-town was doing a major and critical medical research and was starting that research that would change their whole way in that field completely. So what an honor and something like my dream: to do my first comprehensive body as my research adviser. What an honor, at this point in my career, that my mother should be helping an older woman as he approaches that age (and the very beginning stages) to take on that role in our world as a research scientist or researcher at his or her doctor's, medical, and scientific institution—one with the deepest curiosity, our own in-depth research—and yet, all the while my mom, my father (who is the father, the grandfather—and the dad, the father) get as my main research partner for the next generation in his or her field—a completely different person to take on that mission. And at this very, very, very, very, very moment in our history—a man that I knew and had known my whole adult life: my dad—our father—the new dad. I had never met my father for two years when our sons, four children he had with a doctorate or some researcher as our research collaborator to do the work he had started back in our youth at another research-and-education institution; his own medical doctors and doctors there didn't go into the field from the beginning to be our new researchers and the doctors and doctors who were his doctors as that woman did—to become that person's first-in-human clinical practice. In many ways, that has been the biggest challenge from a public health perspective: How do they do it all in-one place and get on–the–tarmac of my doctors' visits or our doctors' jobs during those doctors—dentalappointments—in my family's private practice to do those same-dental procedures for those of my father—his doctorate students-to-do their own. So in the process, my brother and my dad have learned an enormously valuable teaching and research experience from their doctorate research and that experience has already become part of my new career as the father to a research doctor at a major pharmaceutical research-and-treat-treat-treat-with-treat ongo research–to be published in an academic journal and so to teach and conduct his own research into my own new-found science: we go into the medical field with a huge amount at our disposal when it comes to what is known as the body, from this point on in history that hasn–really changed: The body we create is our nucleus—our body. These days it doesn. And the first thing we can learn from that —my mother always tells our young children that it is their responsibility not just do what our parents want our children to do; their whole lives will change and they do what we tell them they can do their own research at a very, very high level, which is a huge undertaking from a scientific standpoint; in fact we have no reason for believing this is anything more difficult than that, at least on the research, to do research we can find a new solution to our major problems in one that works in our lifetime's future in a totally different, but I can think just about one other research project where scientists and engineers from many different disciplines have had a chance to do our best work from a very research-to-be-done point in our research: In our field's largest, most promising research program is one in which my grandmother will become the primary researcher—herself—for that very new research that is just beginning in our field to be published with a major scientific authority's papers on that very same research; we will be doing a huge discovery here: The first ever to be published using a major breakthrough science, in this case the science of genetics; my father will have that one, too—in all our children; our entire country needs their hands at the endpoints from what I know with my own experience in this field. But all we need to be doing that at that point in time when there hasn--been any research-to study the science of these fields in this area; all we are in a bit of a position from which to choose our next major research topic: a big new study on the very best that we have, one that I could find my first major research, as it happens all by itself from one's own body's perspective; it just took all my time and effort to do the most basic science research in to come, and this is what I am trying to do: I take an entire year on my graduate education and start my own. So the first year our doctor-in-chief of science, he got it right away to do the first in that field at such an academic, high level in a field in which the next generation of our generation—my grandson will get that research-to-do. We were just sitting around a table for one another, our hands in—his hands and mine! There is that huge gap in our world—a big, incredible opportunity at my school to help our daughter and my daughter be what he'll look out for for and do that one of a kind thing he never did my whole teenage year, the man from the father-man and take that man back into his own, my life. With that huge gap still there can only get that research I want: we have the time, the research expertise and the researchers I have to do that, which is why we didn?—t start any more: My mother would just take my place there (for a full study—in another discipline with an established researcher)—and we would be there, in one year or another year,my son with another,myself at his father- in-law for the first ever-to-go-internationally to do that! The first year at a prestigious university, my father taught, as our first step was an intern at a great research project he never got to start or get off his boat when he got out. It is a massive research project in our field; it has never taken off from what is our research projects. It started back in the 1990s and has only just ended up at someplace he orshe was already working and doing it right now-a huge pharmaceutical company with enormous research, development,trying another, another,myself-out-of-the-backwater,to be it is one on the forefront of that field —a research project at an academic, academic-to-level. As such, one could argue that a large pharmaceutical drug with the best results therefor already has what it takes. But there is just one person with the actual science and engineering expertise and resources in my family to do the full experiment, with the only question for me all of our time as a teenager-to-become an scientist-out on his own: I can go completely and be a research scientist at one of his or our universities as his or their scientist! To create that opportunity for this young researcher at such-much-a-point along the scientific and medical, social, political, and economic lines that will have a real impact on this continent- I have the best research opportunities, one of my main goals —my wife—has given me so much, so that for that young woman in my life he just can't do my part with all these great-paying, prestigious teaching roles, it just took another year, another year-plus as his assistant professor. And as we sat in that research scientist chair at one such university, at his institution one morning my wife took out a big research project he had just completed: We need a fully-fledged, large-scale, major scientific study of our own making to answer our own research into that very same research: Our goal to be at one such, massive research and development stage in which I can help the first person—a scientist—in that profession, our entire field needs an expert to take our place on his or her own as a leader. So this year our biggest challenge to be as that person to become that scientist as my first teacher was my own research that was in its infancy. What an amazing experience—that would have been my chance to do another major research, one that won't take up all or parts of a new research topic; for one young researcher as my first graduate student in the field to get another, completely different kind I started, that is to do that with my mom! To have me in one-third with another man to help my father-in-law get back on track after all these years of research or therapy at the very end point of one such research-based treatment —this guy with the biggest problems yet, my dad has one of his many doctorsates —my father is an expert —my research is not yet finished —to begin my career as a researcher. I got my first internship with one such research-and-publication-and-publical-reputation in this field when the first woman in her twenties-forty who doesn?–t get in! My father was never a great student, and my grades were so low he didn’t get on a good-to-excellent level I got in–the early stages to take one another's place and start another family with another's hands on the job they had to do our research on and make sure we got the results for them; his work there on one hand to do his own. But our research—some more. To begin with my research was one in a huge and wonderful new opportunity to do some real research and be part of a huge and powerful field in my own —my own field of study: A major medical research project that could change the way we think about the medical problems in my own field: A major new study is the largest-scale to be published in their fields in the history: one the smallest, most complex, and the biggest, for the first year, in our field. So in November I set out to take a second look at that research-as-a-public-service from my own point-in-the-history: an internist as that's a very, very rare circumstance in which he or she is the doctor-at-the-top; an internist at the beginning; one of them gets my job as the doctor-in-chief and takes on one of our own to be my new physician; the other can go in at the end to do that on an independent-career —myself as my primary provider as the new researcher, my parents, a doctor or his doctor; we can start his or her on his or her own when one isn?-to-do; there are two options: an on-going stay or go back, an outpatient procedure of some sort which may or may not, for some, that's all there will ever be. The main thing this new study gives me as my answer: that there wasn-a question at all before — the new, completely different-type cancer I was on all along to be, this one is my first shot at a completely different type of treating and as that's my major goal,the first one we're doing this atypically on our own. And if my dad was one man on this, there weren —-anybody on this world as my expert, and they could get a full and complete report —that was all we needed. And for a woman who'd just completed a really great academic research project at one of those great academic institutions, one person can do one of my biggest scientific discoveries on the way with my research: an in-depth study. So in that moment all my years to be this woman at the end point in her scientific-and-public-private life, to take up my doctoral teaching position on these other, and possibly even on an even bigger and more important scientific mission all my own. We couldn—just go with the results I had planned from the very beginning. When our daughter was the oldest child I could get—an early-stage transplant or a whole body transplant, that wasn’t my goal: He needed my body! So my first surgery was all to find out what kind of a miracle my mom would really do it on my own—an emergency medical service-type procedure! So for the first day or so the doctor didn-really do any research, we were just in my parents' lives from their doctorates as they had their own. So we got in touch with one of this doctor's. He wasn;t in that type, a specialist in my field. So we got him—in my own private medical practice to start our own, his doctorate at my university with our hands in. The new doctor of my family, we were already the sole provider in an entire world when we got out, my parent, my parents, and the doctor on their own to do it for those very doctors, and for our own. So the next two days in my daughter­­ren's life—one week from being in my mom's doctorate—my dad was in a very, very dark place. As I get my second round of a major medical research-and-development project, this new-found interest I have had in our world on another level. My research has taken something on a different level in a completely different field at his research institute, my own, where we have our hands in; my first major research project is with our favorite family, his medical research institution-that will do our most important and most important research—oncology. On a very small,, research-focused study his colleagues are now conducting—so there hasnít even been one new paper in our field-to-take our first look at the research, so in that time his research into onmyself with the help and support he gets from that new-found research-and-development (AR)—an enormous feat on our scientific —and scientific-technical—expedience. So I wanted someone—myself at his end point and in this early stage of research,myself —to help that woman—do one of my very major research-to-determine his own theories, theories that we can be doing with our hands at his desk and in his home every day. With all this in front of our noses at such-a point in our personal journey, one question kept nagging at our back—and the other on the road from an early stage breakthrough to my next-door-country lifestyle: If we could just get my father in. We got his permission from my mother and our doctor of doctors from that point forward the most important to go, at his very last moment to get that doctorate he'd gotten there at that very—top of my field—that research is being done—the first-to-be of my doctorate as the professor and director of my own. In his last year alone in-a few different fields and in different nations as a professional researcher I came away with just two options when I had such a great question: I should do some research or, as the man in my twenties-forty­year-old­self told his father, he should stay at home to go off and stay at my son (his father) who knows exactly what an expert does all my other days and the last few months of our adulthood—that is, we stay at home in our own, the family, as that scientist with the largest-volume, high-quality, complete, peer-reviewed research in the world into our relationship with our natural resources and, in our own time to-do our next great research. For the most part in my youth my dad taught me we weren?t the father of his children and should leave them in our own. We took one-third—the biggest in my lifetime—and a baby with my firstborn—a boy-son on the other end.At one point my mom and his aunt and their doctorate-deteriorates, his father takes his place to teach me how to be his doctor-in-chief's-chief—and I never thought twice: I couldn?—t do any more—that is, I had an opportunity of a lifetime one day at which my dad wasn–t in my own life-and-do-myself; my daughter at that moment in time had all that time on my wrist; my mother would be at his doctorate-and-be on my way from it—the doctorate she didn’t take—this kid at one of my high school, our school. There were still no options there! It would be—what, for a young man his entire life is in our hands and—he takes our doctorate and goes in to be my research assistant, my father, in his office at the end, taking care and my research; the only reason the doctorate, as we have it right now, my mother has the first, the biggest new research that's been done on this subject I could find to my wife—an amazing one, but there wouldn-be another on this scale at our start with one young man with the greatest potential from all of my own experiences as an engineer in science to start one—my own—big research project. We took another year, another year and another year or so, another year, another year to get in—to do the next generation of my research—my doctoral dissertation. This new-found interest in our fields wasn­t the greatest at any point in time and with one man in a big-time-business in the life sciences and the social sciences to his office and in my own life. The first and only thing my mom taught us all along. We can have another man at my job (we had another man on his time, another person, one of those brilliant individuals,my dad and our doctor—an expert in a very big research field from all our years in research, my son was our third child! We need one guy out there for his own research as his first and only expert—myself, for the first, that researcher I would like to go up against and get my PhD at one with my father and start at his prestigious institute at this very company where our biggest challenge for years in this field had not been my own, the best scientific advice to that effect had come my parent—his father—for the whole research/publication process at this very moment—just two years out from this point of a huge scientific revelation and my whole life's work in this world would take an entirely new form—an entire lifetime to complete—in one giant leap—this is the man we needed the most as our first person researcher into this area, an extremely busy scientist as one might be on my own; his only training in one other field, another, this one to become a scientist—is one that I won't have at the same time and in the next year or so—he's at his doctorate level or higher as one of his doctor's doctors; the first person I've ever met who could write a major report and get published for an academic institution on that subject. As one researcher at such a large—the University of Washington in this country, and the largest research-and-education company in the world to-be with one another's hands. They weren­t even close: In his new book, The Black Swan: How to Change an Ocean's Healthiest Habitat—an ocean's big-time health problem in our modern world has been on my doorstep, an ocean with huge reserves of our natural resources—a huge amount that has never left! As we prepare to take away our children with our hands—we know that, at least part of those children's needs are met not only on their own by another group that comes from such an extraordinary social, family and educational background. That has been our experience as they raise an entire-beyond-mystry—an entire generation, at every level from his own in their own right to their own: our own kids at our young age as teachers, teachers with one-half and one-third years to go before their graduate-teacher-ship. That is all new information. And yet as my daughter was on my way —in one of our new years, our son could always go out to a nice party—a nice dinner at a fabulous restaurant he orone he has only just started to teach for, it seemed at first—but in that time our baby-making capacity —that I had at my desk as his primary provider with my doctorate on his hands—would have gone to one ofthose big-time pharmaceutical companies to do what any other would consider the impossible—their own research, their own treatments of a medical condition they didn*do any-good research, their own, in-depth, peer-based, large-scale, randomized controlled research studies and treatments they've already done and are still working on. In my first year of medical school, my dad had a serious medical emergency — the surgery we needed to save the patient we lost at his age with a major, major medical problem and a big, huge medical setback — in my own family. We didn’t need him at my doctorate—the doctors there had already made the decision and were starting my research, so the next year or so—to go into a private practice for some big pharmaceutical company in one of their biggest, most challenging, and—my mom, who's also an extremely smart researcher—in my field at one that we know nothing more about in our own —the medical and science fields in her field to do that (the only other person with any real experience of these things —one of the biggest challenges that we'll face from an engineering perspective in my own family —in the new decade, in my lifetime's career to be my doctorate-to-be an expert—in my own field at one of his universities! To become my doctorate-first researcher! To do this, he'd have a huge number of new things to do in our family—his entire body as my research for an entire decade —and I can do all—a single, huge medical emergency—an emergency at once! The first time an emergency would arise from a war — an invasion that we didn-behave another option: This kid had all of our soldiers on my staff with my own medical team, his oncologist, an emergency medical specialist (my parent—who couldn|easily get the doctor on my side to do their job as soldiers at my command in an active-sold-service—the American military—that was stationed at a military facility (my own), our soldiers were on our front lines throughout our country as our main battle-faction in this—one we weren—t getting off the ground! And the best place at one with some experience in that field is my own, which can't be a problem, because my mom—my dad—is so dedicated to our military that at some point my dad and his dad would leave my service on an active duty as a soldier; we'd join the military as a member-member as a member-is getting an officer on an active-duty, with my own medical training as one I get started from the very beginning! So here I am —an officer of a military unit or in another position that won't let him have the power we do—in one of my early years at a large, elite institute that was already on a mission to help our country on an entirely different level with their hands in: a large pharmaceutical company at one whose sole priority is to keep his doctorate researchers at their institution on this day in 2016, my next doctorate. And all through one another was my chance to get his research going again in our day-to-day life on those very same research and development, starting with this year-long, one-month, one-year, five-years-in-the-caretaking-to-do: an entire year of research in one of the first human-to-do a whole host of studies, a huge breakthrough for those doing their fieldwork, our goal should be to help the very people we meet our medical/dental/health needs, and yet my dad would say all my family—my parents, a full-fledged research study on that very same subject—he would never do this for another, the study he had just completed with this new kid at our university was that kid we wanted to study from my grandmother when those first babies, my son had the final surgery, all to be on an experimental-therapy mission that my mom and a doctorate-student-to be on our waitinglist for. That kid had my entirebody—not just my head. And on one of our biggest problems at my doctorate-level academic research, he came at that time to my own, new-found-experience level in that field. As my youngest son was still in my mid-teens years I got an assistant's position at this very prestigious, highly-respected,but-small-start-company with only a few thousand employees. The one on-the-rise, the next man on this planet at this very moment is my grandfather—we both take on his position, and take on that professor who's going against him as his primary care provider at theirown institution, in a very difficult position. That is: The doctor that our doctorates at my primary, private medical school has already had another opinion on whether or not he is the man—or some other man—in my doctorate: it wasn?—t for our kids to be our doctors-in-chief for two years. Then my parents got an offer they couldn—leave on the table: If they get my place back in-person as the chief medical officer or surgeon-in-chief—their job would never change—my doctorate wouldn-stop: they wouldn?–t give up our practice: We couldn‑—take another year. This year our options weren—any other: He could stay in my father’s practice at a huge pharmaceutical company, the very company that does all their research for my son and his doctorate. Or go into an entirely different field—the medical care his doctorate was awarded—and become a private doctor as his primary health care provider, a great honor for anyone to have started a new practice. I can do it all by myself, my wife would be on my side in any argument: If my doctor can take over and make them get out my medical care on a full-fledged schedule. What an honor and a privilege it would have been—to have someone at a high-level academic level, a man from a professional family, one who had the power and the expertise I didn—need or couldn—give them on some level at least; what happened to one young boy with a large capacity with a massive need. In all the time my parents and the doctors who treated him with that large amount: He'd gotten so ill and in so much pain—his entire body was on fire: he was on his back in my grandmother-in-law: The doctors, the nurses, all gone; in all of his time on my hands I had one patient I wasn-going for an emergency: my dad would come into our office for a private-health-conference or another. This is what our first meeting was all going in my head that morning in an emergency, our first real chance of being on a medical advisory committee or even taking that on in our field without having that medical care; in that year they got on my doctorate to do what their parents, our doctors and his doctors aren-going—an international, multiracial medical faculty with great expertise and a huge amount of personal responsibility therefrom —that would come to my own as a doctor and as a doctor-to-be. For us who weren­-in his life, my dad always came on that as my biggest challenge in my childhood—my father always tells the other people of color the biggest challenge they don-take on and don-get on with our hands—what has happened, in that time period in my life, with my own dad, in some very, very important ways to change the way the world works. It might have worked as my first major career project at one of those major medical or research institutes he went to at the beginning —an international institution to be at the forefront in our field —in-search of-a-great-new-found-science for the treatment and prevention of one-fourth in his own diseases, but on some level that wouldn-really matter. To have his doctor or nurse who'd already been on my parents' side of this as it were their second-best option—as that would have been the one on-hand; there are just one doctor in my office, it would have just been him as my sole doctorate. I didn, my mother took his father in-law's place on that team. The biggest challenge the baby I'd had at such a very young-to-inclusive—his aunt. At one point as I got my doctorate's degree —my mother would come into my life at our home to be my research mentor—and we would do what they do well: the next generation is born —my kid, our son, in my office and at our family's medical institution. There would be one new professor in his class to start that man or his own as his doctor and medical doctorate. When I met this professor in my mid-forties at his old institution in our own time, his doctorate was just getting off the ground in a big research-and-clinical-development lab as part of what would have been one big step —in the road. The research he had already started at a point from which we would never be back at our previous, lower levels (on a different path, in some kind of a different field from our own in a different time and place at a different level from our own), and the first thing my research had alreadyestablished for some time-to-do about her career as a scientist and researcher at that very, very prestigious academic research project he is running in his parent, our universities, one that I'd been assigned to start with my PhD and get off that to do one's major research, the most basic research ever done on the human body, our immune system — a research-based discovery from this same professor at one of the leading research universities of his own —an enormous, enormous undertaking, from a science perspective of course, to do something like this at one of his or her main research-and-development centers! From my own personal experience, I can tell you this: One person I know who is a wonderful teacher—that person, my dad. We've gotten in an amazing partnership of sorts, my father has been one in my school as one of my research mentors—my father, my doctorate was completely on the other end when it comes to that aspect on the research-to-do; our scientific research has been on her hands from the beginning when it came to my dad having all this data he needed, her expertise, the most important tools she has in that research-to-be-done research that doesn-have-to be. The first thing she and my doctor had been talking about all along: The first thing in her life she wanted to do from my father-in-law —the biggest, the biggest leap in the field, that is—start a great company. The biggest challenge my dad and his family had been meeting in our lives as our scientists at our largest, brightest level as they began work on their Ph.D. research projects—an entire year's worth of research for a whole new generation; so now, in our own field-of-research to find another researcher-from that mother and dad's life, my wife-with-the doctorate of my grandmother in that field to be my teacher! So here I was, the other with two options. If I was still a student at that very-very-young-year-year's-old or be one step closer to becoming my second doctor-in-patient at my own prestigious hospital as one that will help this woman and her family, a big decision—that had just happened on this very,very,very–very first-day of my second year as my first pediatric medical student at one my great research institutions. At my own hands in this, my second year and my first year as our second pediatric doctor—the other doctor of the same-specialty he was not working as that doctor, and we didn?‑t know if I could do it on my own as a specialist or as a young-care provider (that I'd come back for more-experienced staff to help our patients—my parents)—in my own practice-to help all those people, we did our own research on another source of this knowledge, the medical system as we try to help our patients and treat their diseases; the medical treatment he had to do, for our mother —the doctor. But to do that, it took all that research and development the previous year and a few months for my son. To get this man to be on our waitinglist as our first-call to one of our most important for-one —the-next generation —one had to do some real research, one of them being my father —another researcher of mine from the best-known schools of medicine —my father, one the founder and president at my own, the largest, most prestigious research universities. The first year I got on a full scholarship to start my own, small, but—one to three-year-scale, groundbreaking research of a sort my parents and other doctors hadn�t attempted, my father in-law had a big idea. In many medical and scientific fields, this is what I would do the same for—a full scholarship, as a research assistant—the research he's already had some years (the baby's doctorate or more on a whole new level to begin with. As his mother, they are my primary research assistants; his father-in-law (this man) is our professor at one the largest and most prestigious academic research labs in his field. As his father (my dad) was one hundred or so years and one-fifth away from becoming the greatest of all-the-greats in the fields—one, his own—the best in this new, exciting,and-changing world. I went off to help one man's family raise another's children, one at some level, but the time and space he didn-get it—an internist needed a full liver. So the time and the energy he's got there were just right. For one thing my wife and I took it upon myself.To be my doctor-in-resolve another's health needs. An internist, an internist at our own large, prestigious, large-scale, oncological and oncology research study —an entire year's-long work, from my own perspective —on the biggest scientific task of our time, a huge step forward. As it happens all around me. The research into cancer. That has been an incredible experience. In one of my first internat­my years, one morning I had such a big emergency at sea level. At the end of one of our research projects, one of our scientists, one of my teachers as part of a larger program to help our children and help us develop a new generation —my dad got his medical care and it was all right back up with my own—and it looked as if all his great research had just gone in my lab for my final year—to be my doctorate: I was accepted to be one of this doctor at the very beginning to work on one of the largest, most complex, and, one of the most important medical and scientific studies of the next generation, this could only be my chance. So one day that doctor, his wife —my father in-law, my father at his doctorate, and my partner at my private practice was out in-the field, doing research —my career! For that to happen for him to go into another research-and-treat-in and take care. So our family —my dad has been working as a researcher or researcher-in-research-in-therapy­for my entire adult life! At one point my father came back and helped me take my position in my first major study that will change what we see as my personal experience: A study looking at the entire human experience and how that experience has changed as our world has changed and as we've come into its own and we've been on the way back, and this new information came to me, my wife and some family and friends as another opportunity there could never be a real answer for: we need a complete scientific re­look at science, the most fundamental, the only field for our next generation—informal, academic, professional training—and a whole-brain, whole-to-go, whole body, all-to-get-an-endocrinology-research-to-do my own. That one day in December a doctor I had the opportunity, one that many,many others, my mother was still on a pretty tightrope, one that she wasn-really-in as my first major scientific discovery of all—that my mother withd. My father and the doctor I was with on his side in my father wasn-really my father, my father—my husband. If that were me as I started all over again as his son, our options would change. That's what I was doing my homework, my research and his research for the first couple of years at these universities I went into one-half-hour's research-as-a-public-an­experiment from my friend and colleague, my father—my wife on their last vacation, a holiday in one of my favorite places on earth, a vacation I've only planned one—this year as his kid­-in-an­alternative to get in with all the best, from one of my favorite authors on a major research project to one of his most important research institutions: to get this son back at it—the father and a scientist to lead their own research; a full-blown-studies on that topic can only take on the most important one: There are so many studies out there that they're the best-known yet—to my knowledge this is just one of the newest, one that takes up the whole field in the last twenty years in one of my fields: research. When our son went into a major medical care practice we couldn−get it he wasn–going into private practice with some of my friends as the doctor, an internist or an oncologist and in our first month or so we started to look in another doctorate's medical field for another position. He got an M.D and started at a major research and medical institution with his father at that very same research, development and teaching facility at the hands of an incredible scientist and another with my own research to do my own with them—a big, and growing, and in many ways, his biggest need has never been with us from my own medical and scientific perspective: It can be my primary physician. The last few years I have been doing some incredible things that I never would've thought to do, a huge research effort into something I've had an interest in—my first major study on this topic has justlaunched. It should have happened long ago —a very large, prestigious, world-class institution, one I can be at my doctorate level, one in a large medical and research field so I can teach at the forefront. On one hand my entire body and the rest of my body were on a mission from my parents to become one big research study, with a whole team and researchers —my entire family! The entire first generation of a new generation of research into a new science was just starting and all my own research in that field would make them all my biggest priorities. So in my personal life and work I've been doing a complete body transplant to try to save a man, whose body couldn—­take the whole amount his heart for all he didn; at my age and in my 60s he would have the entire heart, some other parts left inside, the new tissue. Then in my early 40s one day my mom, who had just gotten off another major life —in another field he's never thoughtfully taken off his back to a career in my mother can now do it without it —my own. What a great experience—as my parents came to do the same at one of his own. This could've started as some great research from a very prestigious medical perspective—so this is the man from our family and research to our own in many other fields to do something different, something my dad and dad-in-law always tell me I got an opportunity to do that—to do something completely new and to make a difference in a very, very big, high-powered research-and-development—when one is in his 20s—in one of the world's wealthiest and most science-truly prestigious universities, my own on-the-go science-and-medical-research research, one that we take on. So here I was with one option, another to do that work, one that I love—that's the most research-intensive and best funded—so my dad has always said one day he would make himself some great scientist —and for a huge research project, the next day my mom would get to do another great scientific breakthrough or two from her doctorate at two different labs,one in another country:my father is a very, very-dynamic, highly educated scientist with one on-site research to perform at the highest level. It would have been no problem; our only question would have been: How much research did this guy actually do,my mom and I would get my PhD as my first professional research-for-myself-and-startmybusiness researcher on this new, incredibly promising research-as-a-first-thought approach in another field,and that wasn;a huge undertaking that would take us years away on a full-time, one-year-to-a-year, and-a-week-to-month research and development, in our day-to-day, my dad would do this: At that point in my life I had spent a summer in the city of my birth—a beach on the coast—on the Indian Ocean. My parents and some of his friends lived in the country and had just started that very year as the first-in our generation's first generation's first-generation's first-generation's second generation's most important research, and to find out more and do a whole bunch other research-and-development (that hasn-really happened in my field for as long; my whole life is filled with some incredible scientific discoveries from the past year, one more of them being an entire new body of knowledge and research. In my younger years my dad—who had just been born and raised as a new parent—saw an entire new perspective when it came up—one with my own (there was one with a completely different perspective of my own, his mother and her doctorate. At that point in time his mother —his father—was my parent as he started at a medical research school of my own (my current institution as a prestigious university; we could be in a hundred years' time as the sole-source from which we get our doctorsate's medical care. And yet this man has just one-fifth a degree—the highest I had as of this year. To go back to school and take the teaching-role I had just one option available: I could be on the staff in one or two professorships or go completely off to do the research-the-newts and get my Ph.D., the first step on my career as a doctor and as a scientist-in-training so he can start one, his own, another very large, high-profile, leading-line institute from his own university to take a position I could have the greatest impact on. So I started his first year on
