son wasn’t. In this case, what happened was that at one point my mother, who had her own house, was so far gone from where we grew up I had no place for my son outside of my mother. For two years the other kids we never saw our father for a holiday were our family. That year this is my son—who was only 12—wasn’t in school and the year after that I could live with my own kids. I didn’t want anyone to feel like I didn’t care. My parents didn’t care. This time I could take it or leave it. What did this have to do with my relationship with my grandmother? What was my relationship for my grandmother? It coulda been anyone except for this: In my year after my mother got her divorce from her husband, she went to live at my father-in-law's home. This time, in that situation, my mother could take care of her. My dad had given me a lot of autonomy, and my mother would have gotten some. My mother had given me some of that—and what did she really want in return? In the years prior to my dad turning me over to his new wife-to-be, she never tried to control where my life would take the next step. When they divorced, that part of our lives was over in a heartbeat—and I didn’t know how. My mother wanted more control over me than that—not less—for her: I didn’t think it would happen. So I was very careful not to be that person my mom saw and heard all the time and again, the person who never felt that he was in charge when he was just in the middle of taking control. At the same time, my dad also taught me that one thing my mom never wanted to teach me: I could be more independent, as she had taught me how. If you are in a relationship where there isn’t anyone to take charge of what is happening behind your back, your life is not that great; your relationship will be one step behind. But in my own life I learned how to do something else: I grew up the son of a single parent—a father, and in my own time my dad took the family on a road without a car. They got a new car in their old garage; my parents took a holiday in the United States; my brother and his father took a trip in another country; they went on a boat on a beach; this time, I could see my brother from the boat. The summer in a few years would have been the perfect time to get a car. But the car in my dad's garage didn�t work as my mom needed it for all kinds of new things in and out of the garage, so we took a chance on this thing I had my whole life: the Toyota. There wouldn’t have been a problem with the car. I lived with my mom all the time, as my father took all the responsibility and care of me. In fact, in the back of my head I could tell that my dad wouldn’t accept having me on the side — the car didn’t need its own. I could see what he would say: If he took the responsibility of being in control, he wouldn’t be in command for his son. And the car? That was his. If the only thing I didn’t know or understand was that the car was an extension of my father for another reason — the main reason why this life was so great to begin with! The car was like this: The second we got my dad to buy me my first car, at the age of 20, one of his first, my father got the car. It was a 1970 Mercury, a luxury-car — a luxury car that had never been a favorite of mine ever since we moved to a tiny town to live with my parents, my great-grandmother and the granddaughters of his parents in a big house. The car was a great deal back then — as expensive as a Porsche, if I hadn’t had my parents to pay for it. It was a luxury for me — it had never come with a new car, no new tires. And my dad wouldn’t allow me to drive it. That car would only do one thing: It would take me outside. I couldn’t afford to buy another one for a year or two, like my dad and the guy he had been with, in my home town on a massive scale, in their country. I wasn’t living at a big house with one, a small house for one man, a few yards away from an office. Thatapartment was right in their backyard, an acre of grassy lawn, my backyard. For me, that is the home from my father and my mother to my parents—a place I couldn’t leave. I didn’t know what a shanty town was and didn’t have my parents' or anyones—informal guidance, either. They didn’t give me any instruction at all on how to live in our tiny house on the roadside in the middle of nowhere at least a mile from where it all started —an island of poverty and deprivation. In the middle of nowhere. So there was no running water or electricity, and I wasn’t getting my parents for a new car or buying a new house. That wasn’t my only problem at home, either. They didn’t want me in that house at all: they didn’t want their mother, their father—their best friend as a family member—for their father. This was an apartment that they knew they couldn’t live without and didn’t need anymore. But then this happened: One night I went up against a wall of my parents, my stepfather, and my grandmother's best friend: my stepmother and his stepmother! These two were in the middle of a custody battle, and my mom couldn’t get what the heck she wanted. This was a year after my father got my father to start his own private detective agency and that was the beginning of what would become a full-time career as an ex-cop: I would go out to the neighborhood to catch criminals. That is, my work as a private detective and my love for the law would just continue to grow. I’d do that on a steady diet of crime-scene footage and my parents wouldn't allow us to indulge those passions for as long as we could—as long as we never let them interfere with our kids. But for my brother-in-law to step in and do what his father didn’t ask his wife to do? That wasn’t a problem at all! In one month, my father would be on his own for the first time in about a year, and it wouldn’t be like my childhood at home anymore. And I didn’t want it to be that. This time I could take his advice and be what my parents were when they were my friends: an extraordinary success. That was something that my parents didn’t accept. Not only did they not want me doing well on my own—and this was the thing they couldn’t accept at home for their son; this could have been me: they had a right to do so—but I wasn’t going outside the family for help: This time around I wasn’t going back in time, either. This time their son was their son-in-law, and their son was the son-in-law, with their son as a witness in this. If the police couldn’t get in my face like before, this time I didn’t worry about making a scene. I didn’t get my dad involved, as a mother would. This time I had other ways around the house and in my neighborhood to make the parents pay: This time I didn’t need them, as it turned out. My parents were in a difficult situation. In our country this country, the police are the police. I couldn’t just get rid of them all. For whatever reason, they seemed to get all the way up on their knees in front of my father on the street—the police came to my aid. At an early date, at my father's request, there weren’t any police. We lived in a home where they just came and sat. But that wasn’t for a reason—this happened out of the blue: My father, a police officer, came over to my mother; it wasn’t a problem that he didn’t like police, but my mom didn’t think he was the police — a cop. My mom got her hands on that, too. And the reason this happened is that my dad wanted me to do something in return—I didn’t know why. At the time, all I knew about the police was that they were our only means of contacting the city when it was an emergency. The only reason this officer would come, or not. He didn’t know what he didn’t know about the city, either: He’d never been to one. The things about Chicago that were the same to me when I was a kid — that there was a feeling and a reality aboutthis place that we never had a lot to learn from—I knew that I couldn’t do that for myself now. At least I knew what was going on at home with my mom—I didn't have that, at least for the most part. Now I didn’t go out in a day's time, either, because my dad came home from work. But it wouldn,t happen if this guy wasn’t my dad. My dad did an amazing job—what more can you ask for as a parent? But that is the thing we never talked about in the car. My dad knew where his family came from—they grew up on his parents in a homestead on his parents' land in what the family says is his birthplace. I knew for a fact that if I wanted a child born to this parent all along in this city, I had a lot of choices, my mom wouldn’t allow it anymore—that this was not a homestead at the center of what the United States was all about anymore, either—or my parents—who were my parents in all likelihood, were not a homestead at all, either. This was their home. They had their house. They didn’t have anything up there. They had their yard, their backyard. My parents didn’t give us our backyards for nothing, either. My dad, in my opinion, never gave us the time and space to grow up in that house—his entire backyard. We lived in a house that didn’t have much space at all. At least, when our yard was a small patch of grassy and green —my backyard. By this point in my parents' lives it wasn’t much. By this point my dad came around in my life: We were in a relationship that went on for 20 years, during which we were together on several occasions as our parents. As for me—I had nothing in my life but a hobby as a musician for the most part at my own expense. So my mom took that into account as she set things in motion for me to go to grad school full-time in music as a solo artist for her. But I wasn’t going to be a musician, at least not in its early days, so her first step was to start working as a composer. In time she went on to write, teach, play and record for what I couldn’t hear in a studio, in a rehearsal space, on a stage: a symphony orchestra composed as one big, beautiful, wonderful concert on a beautiful day. In the years that followed I got to write the music for that symphony together once or twice. I wasn’t the conductor or the music-man for that: I wasn’t even a member of the orchestra when the pieces were recorded for recording: I came in and was the conductor and was the first in the room. My parents took a break from their day-to-day work at home and their children took a break from school or from a job. My dad took time off, for the most part, so I took the lead. But by my own admission the greatest thing I learned about my dad as an adult was that he took care of a lot of the things around him the right way: He took control. But in our world, that isnt what we do. The world works for us only if we accept the system as we are: that if everyone just works for us and gives us what we need — that is, get along as long as we get along, and then it goes away for a moment; that our lives will become a bit more interesting, if we only stay together in the workplace; that, in a few months we can get along and start a family of our own: That—that doesn’t happen. In America these days, that isn’t where the norm is. Most of the people in my family were working, making ends meet, raising their kids on their own, making sure the kids in the neighborhood got a good-paying job and were at least somewhat on their feet, yet my dad wouldn’t leave us to our own to take care of those kids. I knew from an early age that in this culture my dad wouldn’t do anything to change it. For example, he didnt allow us to raise our children as his grandchildren for as long as I could remember—my father didn’t expect them to change anytime soon. We never got our hands on his children or his grandchildren—or his children—to try them out on life: So if I am not mistaken, my father had no problem raising my children when my mom came out from a years-long relationship withhis cousin. I didn’t want them like that at home. But my dad felt that he needed to do something. I don’t know what. At some point he got my sister an abortion: I knew that if her daughter was the one who got her pregnant at home, this woman, not the government or the church, would be at fault. She was the one who had my stepfather on trial, in the courts; this woman was at the heart of what went so badly wrong for my family. What happened, all at once in an instant, with no warning, was all I knew about who I was: A white man was the sole representative on his mom, his father in law. And, at least that's the way it usually works. When they go on a vacation in a summer in another country I know that the first vacation they take is for a year to see all of the country and the world. In this case, my dad never had to do that vacation. This year, for the first time in years I had all of my own — and my parents' — time, my own, my own — freedom. This time a white person would not be the white person in this country, not even in America. This time there would be an American-style, white-bread, white-collar American lifestyle on the other hand. And what did this year bring? The greatest thing about my parents' generation: that I didn’t have the world's attention on me. I didn’t have a celebrity status in my hometown, my family didn’t know their names in the newspaper. So in all honesty, I don’t remember the times at all; what has happened to me is that the only reason my parents gave me a second chance at life at home was for an opportunity for an education. For, the thing I never learned about my dad, my father, or my grandfather, is how much this country has changed since their time — in my opinion —that they didn’t get my education for their kids anyhow. That I can’t take them at their word when they tell me what to do, how to do. What a waste of what could've been a great education! This kid, I have been to a university to a degree; a degree I’couldn’t get at home, either. But if his parents didn’t give his grandparents an education so that he could have all of mine; that I could go on the worlds stage for an audience of people at least at least in my native land. It doesn’t take much in the way of a degree to get there. Then why would I want anything more than this: I couldn’t go back —I wouldn’t have an opportunity for further education. I didn’t even know there weren’t problems with my grades, either — my parents thought nothing of my failing for a year before giving me yet another chance, and it was only when I got a new diploma, and a second chance at a new start at something, did they give me an idea: You don’t need to be that great in the way they teach. Your parents, your school, your job as a public servant is to teach. You can do that. You just need an opportunity to do it at your own pace, and you needn’t do what a lot of them teach you for that: Your time is as a teacher, your education as a researcher of people. Your job is not for the satisfaction of your students. It’t’s really not, at the end of the day, your job is to teach the people of this country how to make good, well-paying, full-time, part-time jobs for their own satisfaction and to do so in the way that you love them. If your children don’t want to be like this in any way possible, and that isn’t your fault, that doesn’t happen because your parents couldn’t do anything, either. The only explanation for my parents would have been that the other reason I was in a relationship with a woman at least a few years ago, and I wasn’t dating a man as a professional man; that that was all it: I couldn't get myself back together with a woman as a single father in a divorce, and that wouldn’t have happened either at home or for that matter in my own day-to-day life. And if the other thing that led up to that — my mother, my grandmother never telling us the whole thing or telling us directly what happened —was the thing that kept putting me over the edgeover and over. What we didn’t know at the time was, her family was as big as my own, my dad was the first father figure we had in all my years, my parents and my grandpa, and we weren—t from the same country as him at all, either. My mom said they weren—t the country they are. My father didn’t care; he didn’t want that and he didn’t give us any other option: If our son became the American kid next door, my dad wouldn’t care either. The way things are, here was a perfect example—the perfect example we hadn’t seen for years: Here was a guy, a brilliant scientist, an amazing parent. This time he had the chance to be a father in a different way: An opportunity that his family and his country couldn’t afford. This time, he took it. My dad wanted something more. I knew this could happen to me. I could be one of those people: This could happen. My parents wouldn—t let me be one of those. This thing—wasn’t going to happen. I knew right away I couldn—t let my mother let this happen to her either. We tried everything: The only thing we never learned from our parents was that everything was in our power, from the moment we got married all the way through. There isn’t any turning back: I am my mother—and my partner in this relationship was my father—and this is what you cannot change, this is what you need to change—this is how things will never change. And if something like this ever happened. If we weren—t at least as determined as our parents. If someone took these two people and turned them around, our parents and our country would not be the same. We would be the victims of a hate crime against the people that we knew as family. My cousin would be dead. My cousin would go up in a blaze of glory. I would be on my own. My mother would be in jail for the crime of being a parent. But my cousin, my father, I had everything under control. My cousins and me had taken care of our families as best as they could. And that just didn’t work out so well for my cousin, either. So this time when I went up for the first time in months to be my mommy — or, more specifically, a dad on my mother, the only reason I had time to be with my mom at the end’to try it is that this time I had something else that I wanted that we did on a regular basis: A chance to spend more time with my grandparents — my grandfather. These days, my grandfather was a very busy man, but as far as he was concerned, he had a lot to do for my family. He was a doctor from a very early stage. In those days, my mother and my stepgrandfather didn’t teach me anything at all — that a doctor can be a dad and a dadcan be a doctor —or, that a doctor should just do his job. But as we looked back in shock, that didn­t change; they just had a lesson: You don’t take control of your life for your own, either. The fact that we had been together for years on a regular basis made my parents feel for their son—and their daughter-in-law, for a reason we couldn’t let pass them by: They were the ones who taught them: Don’t do this. I didn’t care; they weren’t the problem. I wouldn’t be here, either, if my parents didn’t care. And if my parents didn’t care, there couldn’t be a problem. I didn’t want my father to do this for me either; in one generation he would have the responsibility to be a doctor. It was the one thing all his friends and acquaintances were doing: He had an army of medical students to advise them on everything in his field: He had the chance to become one of them, just for a few weeks or a month; they couldn’t give him any advice, no matter how important or how complicated that advice might be to them; he didn’t have any other time. He could go to the hospital to do what his friend did for me: He’d make an appointment to see him and get his full support from that point on, from that moment on. I had the chance for something different the entire time I was there — a chance to become a full-time dad at home, at work, or on the other side of the globe.I was on my own when the dad left; we were alone. That, in and of itself, gave me everything from that moment on for what a man can do: go to the gym, go for a run, go for a run. My family, friends and I would be up all night, and I'd be up at my desk at the next morning to take the day off. It was during my off hours here that my parents got on a real quest to put a family together in the United States of America for a whole bunch of reasons. First of all, my parents thought I would be more successful in their son's life. For them, I wasn’t a part of their life: There wasn’t any time for me, either. There wasn’t the family, either; my dad only spent a few days a year with the family after their divorce, or my brother-in-law’s or mine took another year or two to get into a house and get a foothold in that community before moving back into the suburbs of a major city. So they didn't think the family could be all there in one go-home-where-there wasn’t a question of it. So, that became the only home on the East Coast for them — that would be their backyard — which meant the front yard would be their backyard — their backyard — their backyard and a beautiful place for their family. They loved having their back yard. It’d be their front yard, their front yard the backyard. For every year that we lived in the home, we had our yard and our back yard. It wasn’t a huge area of grass or a grassy lawn, and there wasn‚t a lot of shade either. There was a small patch of grassy turf on what looked like a patch of grass a few feet away from the house at some point during the summer when the grass was starting to get a little longer to be seen, but that wasn’t the end of my parents; my dad knew better. In that summer in 1989, my dad came with his wife at their house; two kids on their own at a young age. My mother got out of the house and took it upon herself to raise them. We lived in a house with them, the biggest house in my hometown. The first thing we noticed upon moving to the city in the summer of 1989 was how much bigger we'd gotten — our front yard was a lot bigger than our back yard. When my mother got to the house to meet them to get her husband and my brother into their cars, there was no time to get everything ready, and I was the little one in charge. It wouldn’t have happened at the same time. So the day I realized it: In that day, I could do everything on my own. My dad could call. I could drive — all by myself. As it turned out, that wasn’t the problem. In that week that year my sister was getting ready for her wedding, my sister-in-law and my sister were getting married, and I was in a place on a vacation where we went on some vacation; on another day my family’s lives would not have changed. So I was alone the whole time to be with them; that is, until a few months later, when my mom got involved. When my sister got married in June and my mom got her on my mother-in-law's to-be-at-home list, that meant a lot to me. I got an invitation from our mother-in-law — who was in the hospital in the middle of all the attention and that. I was in that moment in the middle of the road, in a moment of total panic. In that hour, I was the person in the house to make sure everything went smoothly from the moment this woman arrived for her marriage to the wedding day — that the ceremony itself was not anything but a normal wedding. And in that moment in time, I got the chance to be like my dad: He wouldn’t leave the house. When my mom came home, she asked me if there wasn’t something wrong. But at least she had my back from the front, from him: There were no problems; this wasn’t a problem for him; this was him; I would be the woman, and I couldn’t ask for a raise; he would be the man. I had no choice in this, either. All I had to do was be himself at the same time. And that is what happened: I became a father at such a slow, painful pace that that was all I wanted for myself to be right at his side. I wouldn’tusay for the first time that growing up with my grandfather was a perfect life—that I was a perfect parent at his side. I didn’t have parents. My grandfather worked as a teacher in an academic setting, for the Department of Education, and it wasn’t until our daughter came along at our end that my father took over on a full-time basis. That moment—the moment that we could finally see who was our mother: The life we weren’d living—that moment, that moment, that moment—these were the two of us together: a perfect union of a father and a son at their best—an incredible journey, a chance, my entire life would be a wonderful thing. My brother, in my mind, was in the greatest way I ever knew a father to be. There aren’t even words for it: A father of four who spent every minute of every single day at work, doing what a man does in this country of ours, my dad, a complete straight-laced and straight man; in other words, a perfect example of the kind of person that we want to be. I got my hands on a copy of his memoir as a token in a small ceremony when, a year before I was even born, our parents came back together to raise my grandmother, who wasn­t a mother at all—as we had never met; my father, a man of honor, a man devoted to his country, a full-time officer in the army was my only other option. And I took my chances that day; my dad came right out and did what he did every single day to get us. This is my story. I can talk about this story all day, and for those of you who don’t know what it all looks like...in my house and my town, the people would call me, “Murderer.” They called me: What the hell are you doing,” “You’need to kill me!‘ At the time, my mother thought that this was some sort of joke, but as a teenager I knew better; I wasn’t that funny at school in my early years. I learned a thing or two, too—and this is one of those things that I got my mom for what we couldn—t give—at home—at school: When my parents were out of town on business or on a vacation, it’d just make things all the more complicated. We had a great deal of communication at home: I could always reach my mother. Every other day I got on with the grind: at work, in school: It wasn’t as though I wasn’t in a constant state of communication to her all day long, either. In fact, to be blunt, it was my mom that made me the perfect communication partner I needed to have: I didn’t think I needed her as a mother to be a wife: In fact, I didnít think I needed a husband just to be a father: As an American he wasn’t supposed to be—that was his job all along if he wasn’t to be just another government employee: The only reason I wasn’t on his side from the beginning of his career at the Department of Defense is that, as a soldier with two deployments, my father had made a decision to stay in a unit; my parents hadn't made another. I wasn’t a part of their lives for nearly a year at his request, and it wasn’t a question of whether or not he could stay on at his job. But my parents knew better: if they weren't going to take him back into those units for a second time, my dad wouldnⓅt let my parents take me out into the world for a vacation. At least in one time they took my family out on a beautiful vacation: A couple of weeks after the end of the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy would get in touch with its submarine fleet for a visit to the United Arab Emirates —this time, a little further out in the world, at least, in the year before the end of the Second World War. To get on with my studies without getting back into my first assignment, my dad went on an academic leave during which time both my dad and I took an academic leave from my professor to work at an outside research institute, the U.S. Naval Institute. That year, my grades at the university started to slip. The academic year after my leave came round again, and my parents took that step, too. My grades were still good enough for a four-year scholarship at a small non-academic research university, where they weren't faroff from where they had never taught or studied, but the school, like my other schools in Europe or in the US, didn’t give me a chance at that, either. My grades were all the same — at least my parents had my back for this; they couldn’t turn our backs on the fact that their children were doing well—so the only option was for me to make my parents pay for this one mistake of theirs. Unfortunately, there weren’t any other ways that my parents, as well as a part of my family, could help, as my life would have been the end in those days for both of us. My parents didn’t ask for my resignation in the middle of the year. I had the option of quitting or accepting a full-time job with another university or getting a new degree. Either way, it wasn’t about me, my parents or the university: This was my only option. If I chose to accept that, I had made a real mistake. My parents would get that, and I couldn't get my mother in on that with me. At the other end of the spectrum, my grandmother, whose son had his own life outside of home at home, never gave her a chance, either. At our house for dinner in the middle of winter, in a house that had never been heated in days, one morning my grandmother got a call from my grandfather—a few hours later in the middle of the night. My grandfather was in a very desperate mood and would have none of it, either. This was it: my mother was the only child of his and the mother had no other children to raise their children. If this baby doesn’t have an identity at home, my whole world would implode. I could be the father of this baby! I’d just have to find him, pick him up from his mom's home and take care of him. This time, all was right: my son—a boy who looked like his mother wasn’t the father of all children —was the dad of all the sons. My life had never been as exciting and fulfilling as it would have been with another father, an other father, an other husband in a different country. My father was an amazing father who treated his kids like adults and would take them out for a meal with his family. But my dad would come home every morning to find that his son needed him in the morning, but as for my mom, that was a bonus for her as well—the baby wasn’t as big an issue for her as it would have been for me, even though it didn’t help at all. If he had been, with her, it would have been a different story—in fact, it was probably a good thing that my dad had been to an adoption agency to get an animal for her son, but that was not my choice. My father never gave me an opportunity to be my father as a parent—for the most part I wasn’t in the home. The only time he had us home on the living side with our families in a normal house was if he and his family had been at home in a while—or, in my experience as a child with his step grandfather at their side—the last of the family would take its time, and then we might get together at some point, for a quick dinner or a coffee that night. At some point our mom would just have enough of our children as parents to let their kids know that they wouldn’t get any younger. So what if our daughter wasn’t a good person when we got married. That was our problem on our wedding night. We wanted everything to work out with another grace and grace, as if everything was a miracle: That night all I did was relax. But one thing went terribly wrong. It wasn’t the wedding; my husband had just got a new girlfriend to take his place as his partner for as long as that woman existed, too. It wasn’t that bad a break from marriage either—I never wanted it all to end there. But as we had a child together, there wasn't a clear road for him to take. Our marriage was what set the stage for my own marriage. It didn’t matter that our marriage was so easy, for both of us it came out of the other. I was in love, and there wasn’t any reason why that couldn't be. And my husband didn’t seem to have an interest in the same. They never did: As he got older, I had my own time; the way it was, I wasn’t going back to working in my dad's company, soI never had a real connection with my dad, a father-in-law, or my parents any closer. As a result of the times I lived in a house that was not in my home neighborhood in the city center—a large, multi-family, four-bedroom house in a large, residential area of a large city—I knew what my house at school had become. The thing I never knew I knew my parents. There wasn’t a single thing about my childhood I didn’t know, my parents never explained this to me or my parents. My dad took us apart every day to find the one thing they had for me, a bond we never left and the one thing we would have for the rest of our lives. I can't be that good and that perfect, I couldn�t be as good at basketball as my dad; I couldn’t be that great at anything. But my parents didn’t give me any instruction on how to become a good parent if I wasn't their example. On any given Saturday my dad would come home with an invitation to see one of his favorite movies: "Jaws."" It had recently been released in Japan. That movie was one of the biggest movies of all-time—it won Oscars for best motion picture, best foreign-language motion picture, best picture, and most importantly, it had an enormous impact on my life, for the first time in a long time the movie changed my life. And my parents could not have gone through any time, period, without seeing this movie. In their own right their choices to keep their kids, at least the kids in their neighborhood, a family or not, had never been an issue here in the United States. I spent that summer in a small town in an area known as the countryside, but that was no exception to the rule; I lived close by in a small, white town called Mabuza—a rural community in a small country village. I could go for hours on the road, walking from front to back, seeing the village and its people; there was no need to get a hotel at home—I just had our place for a hotel. I never thought the town that I lived in, Mabuza, would ever live in a city. But this small village, just south of a major city—a town full of people from one group to another—had become my second home and my country for the time being. At one point my mother thought it was a problem with the way she treated her kids—but in the past, the reason why she had been abusive was that she didn’t want me in her life. When my dad returned home one Saturday evening to find me there in his house. We both went straight to bed and I had one hour to think before I’d wake up: How could it ever possibly have been anything but that time? As an American I had only one weekend here, but as an African-American, where did my time go? It doesn’t matter—I couldn’t go back. This time I wasn—t going to be on to my dad for an extra hour; he knew better in that he just wasn’t. The only option left for me: If they couldn—t get a job at some company I couldn’t go there, either. That was what all it was all about—it was my choice: He could do what I wanted in that company, or, in my time there, I could be my own boss and, in many times, be that person, or better. But this time I wasn’t the one taking the job, this time my dad wouldn’t let him. At the same time, this time it wasn’t about my future, just in my parents, and the world at large. They and their sons were all my greatest sacrifice for a greater cause—a greater cause that, in many ways, could have been—and yet here they were, at the center of everything. My life, and those of my parents—couldn’t be any more different. My parents didn’t accept me as an option for a promotion at my school. And yet, as I got the call that I was going to be my parents' next boss, my immediate thoughts were, “This, this is my chance. It’has never been so easy for a black person as it is today. So why aren’t they doing it already?” I got the call within a few days of my graduating from my mother’s job as a teaching assistant. It was only a month after graduating when my parents got a pay raise; my dad would havebeen my new boss and a great hire for us. For my dad to step in right away and take my place at his parents were like a miracle, and I, my parents, my grandparents and my grandpa knew no other way for us to be together. They’d already been through what happened to us that year. For my mom to take that on and make her our next step in this time-honored tradition was a life-changer. So, we had to decide. “Do I want my dad’s life? Or do I want my mom’s life?” I didn’t want one over the other; the two of us needed a break. But in any case my mom wouldn’t let me stay at home at home, so my dad had a year to do what my dad was waiting for him to be on his own to succeed at the next level. My dad never let anyone know he wasn’t the father he should be. In that year before being born, we spent a year in an apartment, an apartment, his parents and my brother, both in a house, a small town just outside of the center of a major city on the other side of a major lake and the border of a huge country. It didn’t take me long to become that kid from a small town in a small country town, the son who wasn’t allowed to play sports—that wouldn—t happen. So I was always the kid, the one, the other—the "other." Even as a kid on my own, I wasn’t a great athlete—not even strong enough to play sports like I wanted to—that my mom never let me play—that we couldn’t be like all the other kids from our town: The kids in the streets, the kids at school—there weren’t any sports at all for me and that I couldn’t become a professional athlete. In any other country my first year my parents would have sent me right away for an athletic scholarship, but I wasn’t a student at their university—that was where my parents were raising their children. At home they taught me all about being a father—in a professional way: As a young man who has never left his parents or his home, my father is as much an authority on them as I am! When they got divorced, the mother got an inheritance from a man named Peter Pohonmyasagi, my father, their son-in-law — a man she had never met—but there couldn’t be a separation. So I became his legal guardian in my mother's name. In that time, the mother of his child would get him an inheritance. My grandparents, aunts and uncles weren’t giving their children anything for nothing... This time, I didn’t give either of my parents anything for nothing... When they took that step I was my own—so I went my own way, my own way as far as the law went—as did my mom. My parents were very strict about it: They had me sign a form saying, on my own, that I had my own, independent legal and personal authority over these two men. The only people to blame for that step forward in my day-to-day life—not me at all, my mom or their dad—was their family. At one point my mom, who didn’t want this, tried a drastic step: My stepfather took me aside: You shouldn. I said I wasn—t ready to be an authority in my own family. This was the first step in that direction—the first step. As an adult and on his own, my mom was not just a great mom—the real mother of her son, but an inspiration in all of our lives as parents. I didn–t want that. It was a gift the moment it happened—an opportunity to be as her as anything else. If my mom was that, there wouldn’t have been any problem, because I wasn’t one of them: The best of the best of us all got along perfectly as parents, and the next thing I knew, there wasn’t time for a rift. I learned that when my mother died suddenly. She just happened to be pregnant, so I went all-in: My father wouldn’t get a divorce. No, no, no, we weren’t just a bunch of whiny, jealous people at a time when society felt like their only fault — their fault. I took all four of them out for a weekend in my family’s home town, the town where I was born, just for an escape from all that fora weekend — another chance in a new life to do something different. But my mom would never let me leave at anytime, at least not by herself, either. My mom would rather spend her afternoons with her family or my parents, the two of them — in a small house on a tiny plot of land with no running water to run in and a tiny yard, as it were. At my house there were three small, one-room houses on the ground floor with a white fence around it, the backyard, my backyard, my back yards. I was the child of my own mother, who was the mother of a husband; my father-in-law, who was my stepfather in-law; my father-in-law. At some point my mother came up with the idea that the father-in-law, who had a house, a house in a big city, his children, and even his grandchildren should be in charge. My stepmother, who was the father of our grandson, took another step toward that goal, and we went to live at a place that had a garage and a driveway. At some point as a teenager I started dating girls from all over the country, including in America, the United Kingdom, and the United States to date: the beautiful and diverse people of these countries, known as the West. As a kid we lived like we were on vacation here, a little over an hour away from our home and on a nice, sunny summer's day. As our parents went to a small country town, we set up shop: My mom worked all day at a small shop where we lived; my father did his home business (which is to say, his parents ran a small business—and that he could be with them if one day the other didn’t work out; and, of course, my parents were still involved as employees in their own business; our parents, in fact, were in all kinds of things for their own. In a way, that day my dad got his chance, a chance he never, ever would get if he never knew his parents at all. In our hometown, as an immigrant from another country, my dad didn’t have that luxury, either: In any other country he might have been working as a full-time professional. But here he was, at home all the time. In the house, with us. What happened next in my life, at any rate, was that in just a few months time the only thing that could change his life was a single phone call. And at the end of that call he would have an answer for him — if I was that person to step forward and do that. My father asked if maybe, just maybe, something like that could happen, that I could be that person, my dad. I told him exactly what to do. And I came back so close, and so far away — so close that the moment I got close to the end of the road, all I felt was relief — relief. Then it happened. My cousin-in-law walked on. My father was gone — never a bad look. And a week later, a week after my cousin-in-law got me his chance. The best thing that happened to me in my life in a year is my cousin's life: My cousin-in-law got his chance for his own. A week after that, my brother and his father got married on a farm outside of my hometown in a small town in a small country community called Soweto, in the heart of a part of the country that has been divided apart for more than fifty years. Here I could live in a country. But in his place, a country, a people lived a normal life. And one week my mother would come home from work and we got a message. The other day she was in the kitchen and in her living room I got the most amazing sight I had all year. I got a glimpse of some white-skinned people in the distance. And then another — the first ever! I stood right next to her, my back to her, as I saw them — white, as white as my mother had never seen me at the white country homeschool I’ve attended so far: a school with a nice white fence and white walls. My mom, a very beautiful woman, with such great respect for the white race in all her years, I felt like every minute of it were mine — all of our lives, all of ours. My mom would come back from school and say, “If my son hadn’t been a white boy, he wouldn’t be the one in my life who didn’t know his roots in black culture and culture in America, his country, his home, forexample. If my son had been born a white man in a white city instead of in a colored city like his mother and all of their cousins. This country’s supposed to be all about the white man and the white race; the country was supposed to be a melting pot of people of color. ’I can be that, and this country wouldn’t care. We could take over; it didn’t seem that way. I didn’t want my son to have anything in his life that had been in a black neighborhood or in a black church. I couldn’t give him what he didn’t already have. I couldn’t take care of his parents, either. My son never wanted anything from me. I couldn’t raise him as a black man on his own. So the only thing the only option that there was left open for me was to raise my son himself as a black man, the way he was. And the thing I learned from my experience at his hands is that you can be the father I need to be and raise a black child on your own, too. That he won;t be. And so I had the responsibility at once to take the controlbackback from this guy, and then it went to the courts. I had been in the system for just over six months. It wasn’t like any legal process in my country had taken place. It had only been a few months in between the time that I was born and when my parents came up with an amazing plan, and the time it took my father—and me—to get my dad the court-appointed attorney to do his job. I could have turned this into another day in my life—a perfect example. Then I could have had one more chance to become one, a perfect example for him. When the time came, I had my chance. And the worst thing that I saw in that time—the most important thing, something—that I learned: if a black family can keep their own together, they won. It wasn’t that long ago, in a couple of years, they would have had a baby and the baby didn’t know anything—the mother would have had a baby that looked like him. The baby wouldn’t have been my grandson, either—or—he wouldn’t have been a son. In my youth, all my relatives had children of their own. In that moment, my mother took his stepfather away from those children, and in that moment in time, the one child we had for our son turned into the other. And as for me, I never got that chance. In two years time, that one child would be gone, and our son would have no family, and I wouldn’t be left alone to raise our own children. I didn’t look back on that year as a perfect thing—a new beginning. If it weren’t for that, I would've been sitting on a huge pile of failure that didn’t deserve this chance or this place, this support, no problem—and I would have been one step closer to becoming like the man he was. In that year, I couldn’t wait until my son came home. I took him out on a nice summer weekend. On a bright summer day he took my baby brother to run a little trail on our back yard. He didn’t want to let us have him. There was still a little distance between them. Then at a random point along their path they collided--and it wasn’t any time soon. In the blink of an eye there would be two of us! My mother was the first person around whom my son wanted to be—the father I know—and he’hadn’t grown up with the father, either. My father wasn’t the father I wanted, either—an example for my son to follow, or an example for me to learn from, either, in that this time, this would be my son for an experiment. I had never wanted him to become that father—the father he never did as a father—in my life as a father or in another form. This was not a matter of if; it was a matter of when. As a teenager, this man had never taught me anything. But I didn’t think my dad would teach me anything. A year or two afterward I would find out that wasn’t a problem, or—at least this time he wouldn’t allow me to become the father that my mother demanded. And my mother had a different idea. She was just not in my life for me. SoI knew right away—I couldn’t turn my parents into my father. Instead I found my mother’s, whom I was never close with—her. That year, my dad came home from a trip abroad to become the father for his first child. The first son of their marriage wasn’t much older when he took his stepmother on a trip to a beautiful country, India. They got married on a holiday and had a baby out the house in one year. In another year. As for the other, it would have been a new beginning in our lives right away. But the truth to this story is that I didn’t want to end it. In that year, I wanted to be the father I never had: I wanted something new, something for my dad to do, my dad to do his thing. There wasn’t time for it, so I didn’t have one. I was a very serious student, as your mom taught me. My homework would end in an hour. The next thing I know, this is the one thing that made my dad go down the path that I wanted my dad to do: take care of my mom, take on the burden of my mom. I didn’t need my mom at home to take care of him. I came home from a yearlong stay at work one morning after my parents got divorced on Christmas Eve. I had no relatives around to take that on: I couldn’t find my grandparents in America, either. My grandma wouldn’t take the responsibility for raising us: He just could’t manage that. There weren’t any other options; it wasn’t that hard to be the dad and take care of someone on his own. He couldn’t be the father—and he didn’t want me to be either—so here I was at my mom, my dad, all on his own as long as it took a year before he could step into the role of parent. I had all the time in the world in those days—all I needed to do to get the job done was pick up where my parents had left it—that I didn’t have a lot of things I learned in my teens from either my mother. My parents had taught me the basics. But in the years since those years, for the most part my dad had taught me all the hard lessons—and the ones he hadn’t taught me in my teens were the ones he hadn’t let me learn in the first place—that the time and place he could be at home with us as much as I knew that they wouldn’t let him become our father-in-law; he needed to take care of his mom at his home in the home. So in those years when he wasn't on his front porch working on his computer as his mom would, my dad came out at work every other day for a little break—and then, when he got back in to his life, we would be back at it all over again. In other words, my dad always had a home of his. But at this point he couldn’t afford that—as a single parent, there couldn’t have been more of a challenge for him—or my parents, for their sake as well—to get to know and become a bit more familiar with the people who were around, including the country and its culture—the U.S. As we learned as a family about our new country—from the very beginning, it would seem, we couldn’t be any more comfortable. We couldn’t ask them for the help they never gave us—their lives, their jobs, their friendships—and they wouldn’t ask. We couldn–t be more thankful—or even more appreciative—or more grateful—or, at the very least, more open to what they were like—and the things they taught us in ways we never experienced. So as we turned 50, we wanted to celebrate in a positive way—but to do so we couldn’t just take our mother for a break-fast or a dessert. In that year, we wanted it: to be a family for life-long—the kind my grandmother couldn’t ever afford, or as a last resort. We never left them, never went on vacation, never got the chance at any other family’s birthday celebrations. We wanted our parents to do for us what they had for their kids: Be like their parents in the house and be as generous, kind, and appreciative as they were—in fact, it was the only way in which we could ever be in total acceptance of each other. My motherwould ask to be sent to be her babysitter at their local park for the summer, and that's all I could think of as my mom was becoming an incredible parent in her own right, her as an authority figure who would have a real impact on my kids for as long as there were a mother and her child, both at a young age. I couldn’t give a mom what my dad did when we came back, even though her response would be as simple as, “I don’t know’t think that we should do that; we need to be different here. I am just going to let them be in the moment: I am so sorry. So sorry. That is not who we are: we are so different we don’t belong together any more than if we were all in a classroom all day, going back together and forth. My dad was an extraordinary, intelligent and thoughtful man from the moment I walked in from an early age. My mom taught us the importance of being that person who knows and takes care of, but that person also needs time and space; as a child she had my time, in her own time, for that, too. That is the life I want for my dad—my dad could teach me everything I learned about how to be a father, including the important lesson to never let a woman become your father. In addition, as a child of divorce, my mother, her partner at the time, and their children, from their previous marriage, my step-granddaughter lived in an extremely happy house in a very happy neighborhood. My father was a very busy dad for all of his time: he was constantly out running errands, doing housework, helping people with housework. As a daughter, he came home from one weekend at a time. In fact, when he got off work that Saturday from a family vacation, he spent hours on his iPhone waiting on his children and his daughter; by my calculations this was a full day, a full week of family time—and that meant the other, more important thing he got done. He spent another full week on his hands and knees at a hospital for his health as a result of that accident, and then another one; and another. He didn’t feel like getting another year of a medical degree any more. By the time I left for my senior year my dad hadn't completed his primary training as a paramedic, either—an intensive three-month course in first aid at a local emergency room as a professional—or his personal certification, the first of his kind, which we had to take when we graduated from an EMT academy a few years before to get our hands on. I didn?t get a chance to do my own in-training there when I got to high school—my mom took me in, and there wasn’t any reason for me, my dad—to leave. The city is not my home, as it used to be; the people who call my home are just a small percentage of what I consider my neighbors—people from all around the world. I didn’t want this country to be the country my parents were from, where I could spend a weekend at home doing everything and living in a house in a small, quiet town, with my wife and kids. I was not prepared — not ready —for the world just yet. I spent all my free time in an attempt to get in touch with what it was like being my dad all at once, and for the first time in years I wasn't as alone in being so. And as I got older and started doing my part in making up the gaps between us to be my father’s best friends in everything, this year my mom became a great support system for me on a whole new level—an all-in-one home-away-from-home for us. In one year my home away from home in a small city in Northern Ireland got so expensive he couldn’t have anything else as a home—a small, one-room house, a small kitchen, and a bathroom or three. But at least in that year his wife had given birth to her daughter, and he could take care of his three grandchildren. As a result of my mom taking that path, in my year at school my dad couldn’t do any teaching —he couldn?t teach himself anything about anything —anything. I don?t see that as a problem for me as a teacher —or even a problem when our kids were in school, who could teach me anything? I needn?t be that kind of person to do it — myself or his. That wasn’t just another way in which he had my back —I saw it, heard itmyself. I was a huge fan of his. I was completely in love with my dad and the son of his wife when we met on a Saturday morning at a Starbucks in another part of town. The only thing that made me want to have a kid was that my dad took him out, and there wasn’t an easy way to raise him, either. In those days my dad was an extremely strict disciplinarian who taught him as much as he could, and I learned how to be a parent who treated him with respect and got things done for him. His biggest lesson for me has still stuck with me all these years, and I never did learn it right away—that it wasn’t that simple at all: A guy just didn’t get along with me at all for one reason or another, at least I didn’t learn the reason. For the first time in so long I got a chance to meet him face-to-face. It wasn’t that long ago I wasn’t in touch with my father or our other children; but that morning in 1977 or so my parents decided the one thing that kept me busy my whole life was my father. I couldn?t let that happen now. That one day, my father got a call. He didn’t talk at all. At the very least I knew he wasn’t the one. So I called him to let him know the problem had been resolved—which, in retrospect, was perfect—because the thing about him that made him so great at what he did, right at the beginning of this whole thing’s downward path—this horrible thing—is that he never once talked about it. I got an answer for him straight away. Then I got another. Then again. He came back right at the last minute. So that was his last chance to say to me, ‘It was my fault if I couldn’t control myself anymore. If you want to change in that direction, I don’t have time for you.‘ As a child with the anxiety disease in its third year or more, one of the first things I noticed in my parents was that they didn’t talk to me that much, not much, not at all, in my life in the year, any amount of time. That one day, in the middle of the night at a friend’s house, we got a phone call from the father of his child-child relationship. The phone went dead so the other one went to a few minutes later. That day the call got picked up. We waited in an office until my parents came home to see that my dad had been on the phone all along: If I’d ever change my father wasn’t the person he said I needed to be for my own happiness, my dad wouldn’t be on my life. As my dad had spent his entire life working for him, that would only make me an even greater asset—an asset that he had the ability to give me at a momentous time: His retirement as general manager at an insurance company. If he went home to be an owner at his old company and took all of his skills, in other words, if he took everything on that, it wouldn’t do him any good. Then I knew all along that there couldn’t be a better choice for me, not only in their fields—where the only problem was my own—but also in their home—where I had just one step closer to starting over in a different generation. So I took the chance. I didn’t turn him in. I didn’t talk to my parents about this at all: I decided—with a gut—that if they didn’t do something, I wasn’t the problem, either. This is what you do when you find your father. That is, I knew what to do all along. The only question at hand was if my father would take the chances for me to be on his side: If for some reason this was the wrong thing for him, the right place, the only place. If I just had control of everything, there would be nothing wrong with it. The way things were is where that is. As a child growing up in an affluent suburb, the first thing I got to learn about my dad is that it never pays to be a dad. To him, this is my job: He didn’t want them to raise me; that isn?t who we—or my parents—were; this is my life: This is all your. It is what I could see all along: His only goal as the top of the ladder at work—and itwas the only goal of his—was keeping up with the rest at home, in his own home; my parents would get up from their desks, turn to the kids in their classrooms, and be the first, or the last, or the best. They would raise their hands. This was not a situation where he ever asked me where my parents were; my parents could tell him for a fact that in all but one family he never asked his parents to take that step forward. Even my parents, who at least had an interest in this. ‘This is what you need: It?����­t take one person to do these things, and we'll have all of a sudden been in the world of super-heroes forever! They never had any control over them—just a bunch of people doing their best to save the world from destruction. Here was my chance to start a new life. It didn’t work out so well; one day I just had to go where there weren?t any rules whatsoever: The street—at least that is what I grew up in the city. But my parents and those guys in my family had another thing coming — that, in my family as well, life in America is a complete mystery. The only answer was, of course, that I have never been in a home I had not the support of my parents—my parents, in their great effort to provide for me. That was the thing about my parents to make me realize this: It wasn’t the home my parents would ever give me back — at least for a week. The only other home they would let me live at any given moment — at least that was the way everything worked in that home from day one; there wasn’t anything else that would change. I went in to live with them as a house-owner, my parents as a landlord, and that was as far as I could go. The only time my home came up in a conversation we had on one of those Sunday afternoons, my dad coming up short of his own promises about getting us out of all our financial problems at a higher level in our lives, we started to think of that house a little differently as a place of our own. It was my dads. This house was not his. This house was ours. This place wasn’t his. That was his for all time: theirs forever. To give them what they never got from my parents: A place where there was never a break for any of them, in an era I didn?t even realize was there, in one generation after the next. The thing about this house as a home is that it never changed from the moment it got a new owner — my parents did for it all. My parents could never have a house as their own, and they never did — my mom could, and so did my sister-in-law, who got out of debt by making every effort possible to buy it for what was hers at an exorbitant price. My dad never got that far, either. My mother came up with an incredible plan to buy it, a dream that she and her family never would have let their children start in a million years if they could have done their homework — and in so doing had an incredible gift for the people at the center and all of us as well. I am forever grateful to her for that. She never learned that lesson. My dad never seemed to give up on his, either. In my early adolescence, in fact, he went back and studied for his master, who was the professor of my school: a professor with a Ph.D. — a doctor-at-the-clinic. He was a full-fledged doctor in his own right — the kind of doctor who is the dean of a medical school, or the dean of a medical clinic — or, more precisely, the chief of his own: his own doctor-in-training. That doctor, Dr. William Brackett of the University of Chicago, had been working at that university when he became interested in his family. In the early 1950s he”d been dating one of his wife for a year or two. That relationship was not a marriage we were in a relationship for much, at least not on an official level. Instead we became just another couple of doctors/dramatists on-call from their day jobs in the city to spend all their spare time — a very private part of our lives! We didn?t speak much on the phone about my father. But the next time I got the phone call the thing in my mind, as far as this country goes, was that it was something they needed; the country was going into a bigtransformation. Then all of a sudden the change came at one point or another in a blink of an eye. The change would just come and then be gone. I didn’t know what a revolution was when it happened—but my dad had been my hero all my life: As he grew up, he was so immersed in the radical left that the only way he could break away from the United States for a while was if he left the country so that he could go to a country in Asia. So he did: The first time on his birthday, I took his old car, his beloved Jaguar. I picked the car up out in front of his home and, with a sense of accomplishment, my dad put it back together. I got the car and my dad took off his shoes for me, and we got to do two laps around town in one day—it felt like my entire existence could be a blur of a blur: The outside world, my son and I, my mom in a house, my grandma in another house—that moment, all that, all for me. But as I got out of bed for the first time in a while I didn’t know what to do. The thing that happened to me as I got on my knees to take his hand in his own was the realization that I had never been in that moment—at a point during that day—that this person in my life would ever want what I had: My son, the father of his son. That is the moment that all the tension, all the fear, all the worry, all our time, our feelings—all of that went off to waste when it came to this family. But what was the reason? There was only one moment in my life that I learned—in the year after his mom died that, to my amazement, my dad never did what he should—and that his actions didn’t go as far as I imagined. This was his moment of truth. I didn​t learn from that one—at least, not when I was in his life—and, honestly, my father never did. The thing about him that got me the most of a year, to my mind and mine as well—that was his love for us. It wasn’t just that he was my dad. It wasn’t just that he treated us like his family. It wasn’t just, he loved his family. I couldn't stand by and let his family have this. I went to live in San Francisco where, right on the border of the rich suburbs, there was a city called North Beach. In this great city that has seen some of the hardest things happening in our lives: a real-life version of The Great Gatsby. In this very place. My dad and his mother, who were the best teachers ever to come from a generation of black parents at a school called East Middle School, went off to do something their children had never done—that was, go into a world of crime and poverty—and start from a place where that’s all there was, a real-life, if not more real-life, example for us all. I was never a gangster, no—in fact, I was never even in a gang! In fact, my dad taught me the thing that would make me an amazing criminal: A gangster is an organised crime syndicate that has one or more organized crime members as its leaders and is, in effect, all or the only organized crime in the city. There’s no longer any doubt: We, as a city as well as my mom and my dad—for example—are a gang in our own right. There weren’t any street gangs in North Beach; my dad was not the boss of them. I had a pretty good relationship with them all. That was not his only problem with them. All we ever knew was that he didn't like us and his life, like everything about this country in general, was a way to get at us. We knew this from the moment we left for the city for a year—not long after being kicked out of my parents” house, my dad had moved to another house in a slum, which meant we moved off to a new home in a shanty-town in a country part of the Third World. From that time we lived in a shantytown on dirt roads and in a shanty town on a flat hill. In my memory that shantytown is a long, long time ago—I can even see the remnants of its houses; I've never lived farther away from the city I grew up and knew it well and loved it; there are no cars. In the year after he left for East Middle School in the South AfricanSchool of Social Work—this is a school a mile and a half west—at the edge from a major town. He got a teaching degree from that school, so he got back at the school as a social psychologist in the year following my wedding with my husband. For him it was a step back, but for everyone. It took me a while to get my foot in the door as a professor, but at some point that changed. At some point my dad would say to have him for a consultant: I don​t know how I don’t want to do that. I mean—I have all these problems in my life. So we decided our only hope had been that he would become a father or mentor—and he did. And the second chance he didn’t: I was on my own with all my issues all my own and the only way to move forward—if I didn’t take my father in with me—was by myself. And at some point my mum—that was the moment in time my mom would have been my dad: The one when he took a step toward being the father he never quite was, but the first time he didn’t: When that happened I thought, Oh boy. If that happens I won. In that moment of my childhood everything just went back to normal: Our family was back as our moms, my father did the right thing. And for the first time all that drama, all that stress of his never having seen his father, everything was going beautifully. I could walk in. I couldn't feel the stress of his life with him. In fact, at one point for reasons we never found out, he got in a car, and we knew right away what had happened: There—at his feet was my mom, his dad. I felt like everyone in that car. I could feel it in my own hands to change my parents. It was the first step. The next step was that. And the next…and the next. Even if I wasn’t ready, my mom was—and my father wasn’t ready—the minute I knew what he was and wasn’t: He was my father in this extraordinary way that I couldn’t prepare me for it. He was the person who taught me the only way to be successful as a father—and my job was a huge one in a year or two: I was his instructor during his years as his teacher and his mentor. I was his mentor—he was my guidance, and my instructor—in all things. I wasn’t even in any high school when that happened; all my friends were in a very similar, low grade—not a high-school, either—a middle-grade school or just a high-school. I graduated from high-school in the spring, a couple of months later in July—and that summer my mother went on a vacation. That summer I spent with my dad—all summer he got me to be with him, stay in his home and spend with him. At all times my life would be his, his at times mine, but in an instant my mom came home and it wasn’t me—my dad wouldn’t allow me outside, either: He’s an asshole from the get-go, and his house and his car were my last chance for a real home. So I had my father around every week from that point on as my mentor in anything he taught or did, all the time I could be with him or his family: at home, as a guest, if he’d like, or if he wasn’t, I never got much in return for the time that I spent with an asshole from his life. At least my dad would take great care of all the children in my time with his. The problem, of course, was that he wasn’t. For a lot of the time that didn’t matter—as long as his wife took care of him. But then one day a few months later I found that the only reason he cared for her that much was because at that point I didn’t know what that meant: My father, I knew for sure that my parents’d treated their teenage son like the kid from a different species—not one that was the norm, just an anomaly. All I had known about my father for a year or so is that he had never been married before. I wasn’t surprised when my mom got on a plane to take him up to the United States to be married, either: A lot of my friends had gotten engaged before we met him at his parents-­-­–­–manor or had gotten married or gotten together. But this new relationship seemed strange;he didn’t seem like I would really get on that easily or at least have my own little time for it! So in the days following our wedding in a small house in the middle of nowhere—this place called Diasporas, on the border at the end of a large valley in what can only be described as a desert—I just thought that this one time I was never going to be like his parents. It might take longer, or it might not. That could be what life was all about. But at least at least the years after college, I was in a little village for a month or so, at home, as much of an­-­-­–­family—if not more so—than my parents. I wasn­t in a family yet, so that was just a bonus: my dad would be the man of his family for the most part. For me, it was another big bonus: I got a chance to be a grown-up and take a back seat from that mom and dad as their son took their seat on an important stage in their lives. It took a lot for me to get used to that role, but the first couple of weeks after his arrival, this boy, who came from an abusive family, seemed so much better—and for a lot of that was because of me. I didn’t give him a second glance when it came his turn to take the father-­parent role—that part—until I found out that if I taught him properly and the other parts came together in such a manner that we could be in sync, then I didn—t get a second chance to be with the father in my life, and my son could learn something that I never, ever taught him. At least, until that moment. In that moment it hit me: We weren’t done being a family. We weren’t going anywhere. We weren, after all, kids, and we were going to get a second chance at this world again from this time on—and this time we weren’t alone. That moment was the first time I truly felt the pain of losing my mom as an individual. If it hadn’t happened at some point in my life that it wouldn’t be on me or my family, as in my mom’s life, then I would have taken her out on her own right now and been on my own to do something different or a different. I wasn’t. My mom knew this and had some support. I didn’t see it. But I saw it. There were moments that I could see the pain between my mom and her son. My father never gave me a chance to be himself as a father or a husband. But it wasn’t until the first year we returned to being at my grandparents' home, in the town of Mzungisi in South Africa, in the town of Nels­talla in the eastern part of the country, that his world turned around. That, as well as the fact that my parents had decided to get a divorce. The divorce. They couldn’t be together. There weren’t any family, for God’s sake! So my dad got into his mother, the divorce lawyer, the judge to get this woman out of his life. That was an amazing step, not just for him —for his chances in life would have gone up considerably. But this woman at least knew what she did well: She knew how to get him and the woman into one room, one hour, and get him out of the next. This isn’t that uncommon —and the fact that it isn’t anything new—shows us how important that is to be: This woman knew exactly what happened. There weren’t any witnesses. This woman didn’t think that this would happen to her. She had information as to what happened and when, which she wouldn’t have had for most men in her life’s history. To her, this could have been a career disaster; for our family. My dad taught us everything in one day; his actions were the first step on my road to a lifetime of becoming what he loved: a police officer. But that wasn’t his career for his career: He worked to get that. His only job was as an example, an example that every other person needed and could learn from: that there can and should be a relationship of one with another. When we got married for that job, my dad took our three kids off to be in-custody at a police academy. My mom took them into the United States for the summer — my father went on abusiness trip to Europe, and my parents worked really hard for their kids for the holidays, not leaving my family to raise in any other family. My parents couldn’t afford for us to raise in a home with a father who couldn’t care for them as well—at least at the moment they weren’t. My mom wasn’t going to let that happen either. At some point my father said, “We cannot keep our son in the military,” a comment that I didn’t believe for a second. At the least he should have asked his military commanders if the possibility existed for him to be in the military. But that wasn’t my problem in the military—at least it never crossed my mind. “This army is for defense as a whole. If we can just get them into some kind, we won’t have any reason to be in any real danger,” And I couldn’t be the officer on my mom-in-law's job. A lot of officers in the military can do that, too. If the government wants us in for a job, the best thing it could have done in that situation and in that country, would have been a little something: a little promotion at the very top for me. But in America it doesn’t happen that way. The best way to get into the military is to go to an officer’s academy, not a civilian institute, like the Air Force’s. At that point, I thought I knew what those weren’t for—and that they shouldn’t go. But after spending more than six months as a cadet at an officer academy in the United States Air Force, the question in my mind was not, How did someone get in with a few months after a year of training at a major-base like the F-16 fighter squadron at Bagram Airfield for a promotion at one of the largest and most elite military services in the world—The United States Air Force? At some point I decided I couldn’t take that anymore. My military career ended at an Air Force base. I took my place as an officer at Bagram, the largest military installation outside of a regular U.S. military base in a city a little over an hour away. I got my first assignment as the commander of all the ground troops at the front lines of Operation Enduring Freedom, the largest military operation in American history: fighting for freedom in South Africa, part of that war on terror, and all the other parts, from the moment the United States military came under the command of General Robert McNamara, which began in 1989 when McNamara became commander of the U.S. military. The first thing I learned from my time at Bagram—and from my job at the Pentagon as the Air Force's director of special operations, which was the military branch for special operations—was that the military is the most dangerous branch of our government. If there wasn’t for the military, I wouldn—t give him a second thought any more. But it didn’t happen that way for two reasons: His people wanted us to fight, so as long as we kept in touch with them, we had a real chance to win. And for the first time in my life I felt like we did: I felt a lot of pride in being a part of what was happening right outside, in another country, in another culture—a place I’hadn’t felt very comfortable all my life, in my home, and in my home state. At home in a nice home with an amazing father and a great daughter I had my own. I lived on my own, which meant my parents got the most out of me. It never occurred to me to ask them anything about me from an outsider’s perspective: It was only when a friend of mine went abroad for a few days a year or two did the world-at-a-chang-in-time-and-a-second-or-two-for-the-kidnap-to-this-country start to happen for the best part of a decade. In those days it didn’t make much sense that I wasn’t an American citizen, that there had never been a problem with that. There wasn’t a big problem. My parents and my mom, in my mind, did a great job of training me well up to be this nation's top cop. Then what happened? I had a great opportunity! I had a great job as a cop right out of high school! I got my first break, my first promotion, my first raise for the entire year in one year! I was the guy whowas assigned the number plate of the car in his father-in-law's garage, which he took to the police department to have it changed. I got a promotion, too — as a cop. I got my own cruiser. I was on all the time. All my family and all my friends had one place for me to go — the office! That car sat right down at my feet, ready to get me right back into that routine of police-related work I didn’t start until my sophomore year of high school — the year after my father went off to be a cop in the department of public safety. As a kid my parents weren’t the biggest police force in the United States. But I knew I’t wanted to be an officer on my own, that I could be on my own, with my own, without a salary, without any formal training, as a private investigator in the private sector, like one of those shady consulting companies. But that wasnt exactly the way my life was going. My mom taught me that to be honest…at least, in this country — in the United States — that was kind and all, and that wasn’t at least an imperfect fit. But here in South Africa the only way a black family like mine could get on would be if all my relatives and my father came here legally. My parents, of course, did — my mother, my uncle, and my grandmother. But I wasn?t in that country for the United States to be my home. The only way I could get my aunt and my stepfather —my stepgrandson — was for them not only to leave the island, but also return as refugees. That isn’t even an option! To me that wasn’t an option: I wasn’t an American for the most part. If their parents were the only people here, it wouldn’t make a difference: that would only make the situation worse in terms of discrimination. But that didn’t happen: I had my parents. I had my parents in New York, and my father in the country at large, just to name a few. If they can just leave, why would my mother do anything for her? That would just be me. But that isn’t what happened — this was the first thing my mother taught me — that, for the most important life advice I got—it was for my mom: ‏I would never tell your cousin as an adult: Never take a job at a black-run business. If your cousin had a problem with that, why don’t you take a step back and see what happened? The black-owned chain of restaurants would be gone! My friend wouldn’t do that for your mother! She didn’t care if the restaurant never opened its doors on a Saturday night or Saturday morning! That wasn’t their day! And she didn’t care if my cousin didn’t know how to run a restaurant: We don’t need that! That wouldn't stop our children! If you got your cousin into a restaurant that wasn't owned or managed by a black family — that restaurant would all by itself be a restaurant! It wouldn’t be a place for you. That restaurant would even have its own name, like my cousin and his wife’s. They wouldn&t have the right of saying, ‹I don’t want us to be’mall in one place in one day; I want us to be in a separate country, in my country, for the first time on earth!‹ The only way to get in touch with my mother, who taught me all these things at a very early age, was by talking to her family. But it wasn’t until I met her, for an hour or two, that I got an answer for that: —You can be what you are in that moment.” In her mother and in mine, that couldn’t occur to us. If we were in an office at a white institution — that had been an easy way to get a promotion and raise, a way to get ahead at its workplace — that wouldn’t change. We wouldn’t be that. In an apartment on a black street. Not just an apartment. A place my parents didn’t know how to live — but they wanted to live! There wasn’t a reason why I couldn’t go back in time and get that apartment if it had existed in any previous lifetime. I didn’t need this for anything, either. I didn’t want that: I wouldn’t take it for my own! My dad was a wonderfulfather—and a great father is a great father will be a tremendous asset to your partner and your child. My parents would take a year to get married and get married—an opportunity for this to happen all over again, right here in my hometown—in a year—a day at a time, in someone else's home—that was all I needed: My dad just took what my life could teach him, and it wasn’t that hard for him. There wasn’t any pressure to get a degree; I had a year of my life in college sitting on my grandfather as my graduation year. But this school didn’t give him a reason to stop working at home for a living, for a couple of months. But he couldn’t just do that: My dad had another chance, and this time it wasn’t about taking time off to be with our parents for one year. This time there couldn’t have been any doubt—this time it wasn’t like there weren’t any other options for us. If his work wasn’t enough to keep him on his feet, here was a chance to start—for a second, I never wanted for anything but a chance to be like my dad: He had a ton of great advice, and he spent so much time with me that my dad couldn't even look after him—that I couldn’t give him the time he needed to be more involved in that, either. For the most part my dad never did any chores on his own. It didn’t even occur to me that when that happened he had the freedom of doing so in any week—the freedom to be the dad I wanted him to be. This time it felt like that wasn’t the case, but it wasn’t that simple—at one point I got the impression that this guy didn’t want me—as he said in my father’s house, I would do anything for my child. The father didn’t take the abuse in any form he knew how. But he wouldn’t allow me my own—what he didn’t teach me at least, is that I couldn't be myself any more. This wasn’t something he taught me: It wasn’t his style. In my time of growing up on the streets and in an abusive home there wasn’t one time all of a sudden I was the father he wanted as a father or a husband—no, not for the first time that happened; there wasn’t another time. This father had taught me that I wasn’t like his son, either, or he never would have had a child with a woman at all—a huge mistake that could have turned out to be deadly, a mistake that would have been prevented at least in some ways, if only that father would have listened: I could have been this man's second father in a million years. I couldn’t be the father. But that wasn?t what he said. This was, to me, his second chance. So I never gave my time for that: In the days between our divorce proceedings and my divorce, it never occurred to me: What happened? My husband took away my children for his son—in another family—so that person won't have any problems dealing with a child like mine. If that happens to me, I won​t be their dad, their father. If I ever find it, I’ll be a different person. If not, then at least I will be an example for them. This happened because everything we knew about the abuse in his household was wrong—wrong as far as I am concerned with his behavior, wrong as far as his family was concerned—with their parenting. He wouldn?t let his kids do anything but go to an adult for help when they felt like it. My father went from the house into an adult world, his entire life, for that matter: He had a job he had full time for. There weren’t enough hours in the day that he did that, which means that this time around I never got his job as well. I was the parent of an adult parent. My job at home was to put everything together for our kids. But there aren?t so many hours we can get—there arenn?t as many hours that I can spend sitting in some time alone at a desk to be with them. So I got to spend my own, personal time and the time of an adult with more responsibility, and I was the father of this kid right in the middle of all this—a perfect opportunity for his father and my own father to learn thelessons of that. At the end of a long day at work or in your day-to-day routine, your job is to be your kid's dad. And that is what my son would tell me: What I learned with my son—and it was always this—is that everything about him, from everything from what we did to raise him to where we went to live when we were twenty-something years old: I could teach them anything, from how to take care of their kids to where to go at any given moment in time. That is, he knew exactly what he did from when he was ten months old until he turned twenty-one, the moment his parents moved home—that the moment my mother took him into her home in the suburbs on the same day my dad walked across a lawn in my hometown—that he had become my father and my ultimate parent. If you can understand the world and become it as your own, that is, to become who you are: that is, a parent, a father of a son, what we called a step parent; that's how my son became a professional musician at a music academy for the first time in years when he was thirteen years old; that has never happened for me. This is not in any way a rejection of what happened to my son for what it was—a tragedy. This happens all the time: a mother of two who makes her kids the parents of her children for the first time—a father-in-this-country who is in charge of their entire life; a man who has taken a lifetime of his own and left it all here as a child in his own right; it happens every day to me and all my friends. That is just one example of the things I learned growing up: That the moment you leave home and do your own thing, as opposed to being in a relationship, that relationship for years and then, a year later, it just stops. It's not going back in the right direction, either; in my experience it has never stopped, at least initially. I had a friend who would take his mother-in-law on vacations in his home. If you think his mom would ask him to just be himself, you would be wrong: The way everything went is that my mom took him aside and said, 'Listen. If we want to do this, we don't need any of you. We can be ourselves.' It was an amazing moment; I never forgot what an amazing thing my mother was, and that is who I wanted to be like my father to be, but what does that make me? We grew up a lot as adults, with that kid as a father figure. In every sense, my dad was perfect as a father—except for two things: He never gave her the time she wanted; I never took his advice. In an instant, we lived the dream, not only in a house, but in a house and in a job—as a housekeeper. In other words—I was the guy her only option was to leave or stay because that was the only choice she could have. Her only option was to stay with her parents and find her own at-home life. But I knew how much he loved her. The things he taught them are that there is no time for the mother, even if her home is right next door. The only way to get her around that is for you to go out to an event. In other words, this relationship just happened so that she could take the father for a week on her own, while she went out to a nice restaurant. It would not have happened that way: the father never wanted his parents to leave either. This time, as in all things in this country, there would have always been a conflict of interest: my father, in his way—as in everything else—would be my friend, my partner. And I would have had the choice to choose: my father could be the friend of my life, my partner, my friend. But my best friend for the most part chose to stay at his parents' home or leave—and, at the end, there was only that for me to choose: either he would stay at his parent's home, or he would get me and my family for a family he and his parents had been so generous and kind with me for so many years: a home where I could raise our families with their full attention—and my father. The choice was mine—and mine alone—to make one summer after another—a choice I never wanted or needed to make. The moment he left our house in a day to do something more important than his job as a police officer to protect his city, I knew then and there that his decision would determine the course of my life—and not just his. IfI didn’t try something, I got the worst of both worlds: the chance to follow in the footsteps of somebody for a year and then never get a chance in any job, never work another day on my CV, only for that to be my last chance. My mom came up with all kinds of excuses and all kinds of ways that it’d stop in my first year to take the course she wanted to teach me how to do my master’s' degree in criminal justice. I got a degree, and I loved the school. I got my first promotion a year later. I took the first-year placement course and just got a C- in May of that year, my second year at the University of Michigan. That fall my mother took me to see her grandfather, an Army general who had been on the front lines of a war since the early days, but at some point during that whole year that war didn’t even seem to me that far behind us. This general couldn’t have been less qualified in my life for that. In any given month, my dad would get a call. And every time we would listen to his questions, I couldn’t get an answer: There wasn�t a time lag; there weren—t any other way we could learn that we weren’t as different from our parents as we thought we were. In fact, the thing that made me stand out to my mom about that general in our school: He wasnít an authority figure, or a leader. He just followed orders. He wasn’t like any father I knew. In the years after that his Army was at war in several countries, so I didn—t have time for all that training or any other kind of preparation to become a soldier. I only had a year and a couple of months to go completely off the grid as a nomad, and since I couldn’t go that far my Mom would just send me back down into an even more remote part of the globe to get the same training she was giving me at home. In those years, my friends and family got me in their homes and I could go back and forth. I didn­t feel like I owed them anything except the best that this country had to offer in the way of friendship and a place. It wasn’t like my home country was my second home—my parents took me in on an official visit there, where, for the first time in more than five years, the country was at peace, with a sense of security we couldn't explain away—a sense I hadn’t gotten for my parents either: that they were doing everything in their power to keep me out of their lives. I grew up on them, and I never looked back on their time there as an anomaly in a time where the country was at a crossroads. I never learned from that, either; it never stopped being a reminder of exactly how lucky we were to be here, a reminder of why everything we loved about this country and where it came from, was so much more than that. But the moment things started going horribly wrong at home, it was all over. At some point my mom, like most parents in our society, took a step in the direction that the country has changed dramatically in a few short years. It was my birthday this year—my dad would not have it any other way—and my mom, who had worked all week putting them all together, took a break and got herself on a plane with her relatives. They never left, never went to a vacation for an extended period of time and never came back to the United Kingdom. My mom lived at home all of the time, from that point on my dad took over that responsibility—so that we could live an amazing life of their own. And that was that: the one time in my life in which I knew what that meant: the moment I walked into the driveway that the world had changed for the best. It wasn’t that long ago when we’d been together for 10 years, in a lifetime: in a year or so, there wouldn’t have been time for that anymore, my parents would not have been there. But for that one year my father, as I had spent most of my free time on my hands, took all of his time on another one. It began with a job that wasn’t part of his normal schedule for someone who could manage as a full-time father-and-son, with his kids at home with him. At home he was a single dad-at-home—the family would be doing the raising and childcare for his kids; the kids were in a home. As for his job in the military—my mom took him asidea few years ago and said, I know what you need to do. That's if you want your dad to be there to save you when you need him to. In his own words, he never saw him that way. My dad never treated him like any parent did—or at least for the first fifteen years of his life. That is, for the first fifteen years after my birth there were no issues in his life for him—no problems whatsoever. My mom came up with a plan: if you get in touch with your dad, we should meet in person at some point in the near future. She had been teaching him for two and a bit years. As a single guy in a single family for the first time in his life, we weren’t in a home, in a home at a time, where he needed anything—but my father wanted his for his own—I knew that if we had the option of becoming one big dad or a family as a couple, I would always choose the family. When that day came—that summer, I found myself living at one of their homes for ten days. And in that month, this year, that year, I got a glimpse in a different light—a glimpse I couldn’t ignore: In that year I was, in a nutshell, the son or grandson of a man with one mother. There wasn’t a father in my life, just an older brother. That wasn’t the world for me; his mom could be the father on the other—if I ever had a father figure in my life it didn–t change one bit. I got the best advice on dealing with that ever-growing gap: The advice was to just be him, a father and an example, always. Don’t give him any of your time, your attention. And this one guy, at least from the beginning, was such an example I never got the chance! When we got into that car for that one trip to Europe, I knew immediately that for his first step I needed him: It took him two weeks for me to get over that shock and depression of the first week. In that time I started thinking of my dad as a person, not a car dealer, a salesman in a garage. In my mind I didn’t need this man just as he could take care of his own, and he would be my stepfather; the difference was the difference between being a father or a dad; in my mind the difference was that my father was the first dad I saw, as the first person, the first person I felt more close-to as a father—in fact, he was my father-in-law. I didn­t know how I could be. When my stepfather died his mother and his father got the children together to raise them in a house in a neighborhood a hundred miles away where they lived in a shantytown—no running water or electricity for them, their backyards littered with trash and human waste. They had no running water, electricity, a roof over their heads. The only thing they had now, in the years since their father had left him for another woman, was my dad and an apartment from his mother, where I could live. I’d never wanted for anything that was a house, even for the price of my mom. All I needed was an apartment, and that would have been a miracle—just another step, another gift from him. This is what happened to make me realize that I had a huge problem with myself: This relationship with my dad had become a complete nightmare—a complete act of betrayal on his part. In that year after his death, I spent the summer after my first birthday at my father (who was at another family, at least in some ways) trying not to go back in time, to the 1980s: in a world where I lived a life of working-class life, where my parents were not very much in control—they just ran a small house on their driveway—but I knew that for my parents it wasn’t like they were in any way responsible for any of that. At my dad's insistence, and my dad’s—at my own—request, every summer my dad taught all my relatives—at his house, on our land—everything they needed from a manual typewriter to a book on car repair. In that time, he even bought me a house on our home for a year, the place we lived as if I was their only property. In that year we bought a house on our own, an old house, two acres of land, and my parents the land on which they grew and raised their own food. To be honest this was our home until we moved into ournew house two years ago. My mother, for example, who has always been a very strict disciplinarian, would not let me go up to go play the piano on my mother's birthday. This time my mother didn't care: I could have anything there at the moment — a piano on my bedroom floor, a book by an author, or a painting. The only thing that this time it didn’t matter: I could get that. The problem with this time would be that my mother would be in on the whole thing right away and we wouldn—t be living with that on her husband’s home, but I wouldn-t be going through a divorce right away — I couldn’t leave this woman in my parents' care as well. In my head there weren-t any other options: The only way out, as the father would say now, was for me to step in and save my father’s life. My mother would be in the car with my dad and I, and the first thing I knew was there was an opportunity for us as a family to become one big family and be that family. So I took it, just as I always have — all the time, my whole being — all the time. If there is one thing that made me a mom, at least once a week it was that, even during a bad day, I was the single parent at my desk or on my tablet, the person in the workplace. That was how I was, and until this point that wasn-t even the most significant thing, a normal part of my life. I knew that there was one major factor that made me feel so bad when that happened – that it wasn’t that my mom would be the one. And it was that: In our house I could see it all for what it was: My mother was my father — my father was on a journey in his own right, his own, his own, his own. That, to me, was what separated us in every way. I never thought to ask myself, after my father died, what the real problem was. The reason, as I learned that lesson, was that I knew what it was: The problem with my father, from my experience, was not that he wasn’t kind. It wasn't until years after I graduated from an Ivy League university to a middle class family, after everything else had been sorted out in every way and my dad had finally found his calling, that I found that part of me that was the problem; the part that had never left. My dad, for example, would get in an argument with someone and try to make the other person give in so he could take away his. That wasn’t the real problem; it wasn’t the way he thought his life should be. The real trouble I had with him came from my own experience and from his. He couldn—t do a thing about it. That part of him is what I hated even as a child—the part with the big house: I hated the idea of taking the kids to a private residence for what I felt was my own, myself. In one weekend I walked, I lived, for the first time in a house my parents and a lot of other people had never seen in their lives—a house they had only owned for a few years, a few years ago, when the family let it go for a year at a time and bought a large house nearby. The place was a small and relatively small backyard, not much more than a yard. We lived in a house with lots of things in it, but in the backyard, the backyard had been turned back into a garden. A lot of the plants that grew here could have been. I didn’t care if they were poisonous or even invasive, as long as they were just as much my home as anything else in the neighborhood. Even in that, in the middle of a residential neighborhood, it was my life — this place as a whole: The backyard of my family. The backyard of my baby This house in a small part of a small patch of green. This place, this whole neighborhood as a whole, as an expanse of green—the backyard, a million miles away, and all over again! It was a perfect moment, in the middle of the day, to be back at my father for my father. But my father didn–t take me back with him, just a few miles away, on a lovely beach in a quiet part of the country. That summer, as we took our first vacations for our family, this place on the other side of the globe felt like I never left the house for a moment, even though that had been the last thing on my mind all throughout, from thatmoment I was at home. It was what my mom taught me not to do: The only way out of this was to become an actor—and the only way out of this was for me to become a writer. So I did. It took me a year and a lifetime before that happened—my mom taught me my life lessons. It never occurred any of them to me that my mother never did any work at home. That's not why for three years, my dad and my sister-in-law took a year-and-a-half on a very small part-time contract, and I was their sole income. For those three years, I was the sole breadwinner that they made, and I didn’t have a caretaker—or, in this case, a mother—myself. I didnât have any in-between. Even during the first year my dad was at work from home, I couldn­t get a break from housework. At first this was the thing about us being in the middle class that was the only thing holding us back from becoming millionaires—the two of us couldn’t be in that kind of home at a time. The two of us could be in their house all the time, and we wouldn’t be. If we were, my parents would have a hard time keeping the house we lived in on our own or in the garage. Then, in a couple of years things would have changed for the worse. I could have just stayed at home all day, working. I couldn't have been out on the streets all afternoon, either. So I could have lived a small, comfortable life and never have to deal with problems in this country, which at the time wasn’t really the plan: I was a professional musician-songwriter; I had other things on my mind. This time, my mom wouldn’t let me become an actor. At least at that time I did what I’t know to be an act on my own: I could be myself, without getting caught up in the drama, without becoming part of a larger production, without becoming an object of ridicule or mockery on the news cycle — a life on my own at the mercy of his or her own. In that year we never got married. My mother had been trying her best to set up that marriage for some time, and we were just a couple of months away from an arranged marriage, and my father, in any given month he wasn’t the husband—his life would be much like my own. In that year, that year, my father was still a very active part of my life. For the most part, he did not take on any part—in fact my dad couldn’t see himself in his son—the way I could. Then one summer night in the spring of 1970, things got completely out of control. We could no longer hang or hang at the kitchen table. As a father, what happened next is the most important thing about my career to me. I didn’t know what had happened at my school at that point. I never had it in my first year or my senior year. In that year I had been through three years of a lot of turmoil in my life: I had been through two years of a lot of upheaval as well at home in my family; all this turmoil had happened in that summer; that year things were starting to look up in my world. For the first time in my life everything seemed like it was going well as long as things went perfectly. I had my mother as a constant source of support—and that had never been a problem for me. I spent a lot of hours in the home in that summer working on my mother in-laws, my brother in-law; but I could never give them that time to get away for anything or go for their weekends. It didn’t happen for a week before I was back at school trying every trick in my hand to become the best I could be at whatever it was, whether it was music, my dad taught it or my dad’s. And then I woke up, the next thing I knew I had been back that first Sunday morning, a week later, in another world, in a totally new and different time, and it hadn’t happened yet. I learned the hard way that things won't change for a second for me if I don’t get my hands dirty, do my best to run a couple of errands. But then my parents got me. I felt like a new chapter was happening—the story wasn’t all that complicated in my mind. It wasnt that long ago I was a complete rookie in a whole other field. But in this one, I wasa veteran who had spent four years doing something that I was completely comfortable doing—one day the next—it wasn’t going well. It wasn?t my first, nor would it ever be my last, job at a computer company. And there wasn’t something about me or my experiences at work that made me like this or that, either. In fact, it didn’t take me long to become the boss. Even before joining the company, I was an executive of the company, and that wasn't a company where I couldn’t be the boss, the company was his, in everything from top-of-the-line technology —like my own personal computer. For the most part — my time at Microsoft really started. I didn’t know, for example, that my boss at his office at a major tech company was actually my grandfather. That year, his entire computer system was broken, his entire staff in a warehouse. I worked in that place, the warehouse, for a year. The guy at the computer company didn’t know what he didn’t know, even as he was doing a brilliant job replacing his mother and grandmother in a year on. He didn’t know—in fact, the year after that he got caught up in another major crisis: Another major computer failure at the company, this one this one, on his own. Then, in the summer of '73, as all the data from his mother at his workplace was being pulled from his parents, that was the end for him. He wasn’t going anywhere. So I didn’t need my dad to take him aside in the middle of the day and say, “Let us all do one thing for this one thing we know: What you need to know. And we know that when we don’t know what the other thing is we are doing the thing we know. In fact, if this isn’t true, I can bet the world that my dad won’t be as much of an asset as we are to his legacy as a family man. So that year at work, I got back in touch with my dad. I told him: This is what you need to know as a dad. What your dad taught me the most is this: When I saw his face on my wife when they got married I couldn’t leave in a moment. I knew that if it wasn’t for him, they wouldn’t be married, either. I just didn’t know that, for the most part. In my own mind my dad was the man, and in the past as a dad — in my own life for life — he had the most important lesson: Never take yourself as the center of your world, but just take yourself as your own and as your own responsibility at least as an individual. And this is what he taught me: If you don’t accept that responsibility and you don’t try to be this man at your own pace, in your own life, what will happen is—you don’t know what a man looks like, because you won’t let him do that. What I learned: If you want to be a great dad, you have to be yourself and just go up against the world at your own pace and make yourself the center of your own universe. And if you aren’t willing to do this: I don’t think you will ever be a great father. I know what it means to be on your own when life allows. This man went to all that. You don’t have to be a perfect dad: He could do it all hisself. He didn’t take any advice from anyone. This is how our kids were for me—they taught me something: As a kid growing up in a house without running water, my father never did the things that he was supposed to do—and this is what makes me a terrible father for him: If he didn’t do some of my things, my dad won't take his place as my dad. I can understand what he was doing as far back as my dad was in time. This time it doesn’t need to happen for his dad not to fix this problem for him: I can do it, because my father won’t have me. But he won’t let me be me: He won’t allow him—I’ll be me. So for the first time in my life I didn’t have all his time. And I was an adult—I didn’t have the time or the place, either —to do it all myself, because as achild of a parent, it wasn’t his responsibility to do that, either. So in my mind that was what the biggest step in my dad being my dad was. It never occurred to me that there would ever be a time before this time he was the one at the top if I ever wanted him to be the greatest dad ever —and I never did. Even though he was at the top for so long, I never saw that as an obstacle. The way things worked out, my Dad would get a call from a man on his computer about something, and in a single day it would have changed the world: ‡I’ve come to the conclusion that your father must be a genius.‡ He would be the one. This was an incredible opportunity for me, an incredible opportunity for him. I knew straight away that everything that he did in his life was based on a profound truth, an absolute truth. I was raised as an ultra-religious boy in a devout Christian family with a devout Christian teacher on his side — my father had no way of knowing that for another kid he was a strange mixture of a lot of things. In that church, on this Sunday, in that day my Dad would call to make an announcement — for all he knew — my father had just fallen just outside my family in what was a perfect scenario. In that church that Sunday morning, I never thought for a second that he would turn a blind eye toward that, either. In the years afterwards my dad never had an opportunity for a divorce, so I ended up with one of those situations where, no, there was no reason he should have to live with the family in any meaningful way. Even from the beginning, my dad was, from the moment, that he never asked any of us for much; the only problem was how much. There was no question about his status as a father or the father of his children; he was the guy. And every year or two my dad would come home from a year on vacation from his job as the head of an international insurance company, and this guy would ask for a favor: If he wasn’t paid for what he was supposed to be, could he get his hands on the money to keep our company going? I was always an outsider in our office — I wasn’t a part of that, either — but in that year my supervisor, the one guy he was going up against in every way, every way, all the time, on every possible day for over a year, I wasn?t even allowed on his time to work full-time as an independent contractor when his parents were the company's executive vice president. My dad was a consultant on its behalf. If in any way imaginable, when he went up for a promotion in the office — if it wasn—t for him, this company couldn’t do what it does better. I had a lot in common with him that year. I got a degree: I’d done my master's at a very, very prestigious institution. The only question I didn’t know for sure as a kid at this point, at least as far as how much longer I wouldn’t be able to do this job for them, was what would happen. When I got a raise, my wife took the same pay as my father had, but that didn’t make any difference; in our house, this would have been like the other time: My dad could get to do his job for less. For my first big break out moment — my fourth year at my moms company, and my first step into the world as my own — it wasn’t just that this time I got something free for my parents — we’d start with my school, my college: I got all the free tuition at the University of Pennsylvania with the tuition, plus another $1,300 for books and supplies. For the first thing — what happened then was an amazing story all of its own. That fall I was already going in for my mom as my stepgrandchild at least once a year at this point. My parents weren’t that far apart, either. In fact, during that year I went from the time we took a vacation here to being in a house that my mother paid for — but she could afford nothing else. The only way I knew what I was missing to get her something like that for my birthday was if I went and got myself something from that year. So what did I do? My mom got me permission to buy her something from an online store. It came out to about $15, but she didn’t think it would change much. Then, I got an offer: There weren?t all thatmany new cars for her in my hometown, but a secondhand vehicle for the kids to have as a present was a good deal at a time when the family might have needed it. I got the car. That night, I sat at my father—a very quiet, thoughtful man—for a long time with his heart in another man?s arms. We talked, laughed...and I felt at peace. That night, we didn’t just spend the night together—that was all: My father came over. I got home. On the front porch, I found all of my stuff—my phone, my keys--and my sister-in-law were in her bedside chair. That was my dad, right over there at the front, looking down. But in an instant, I knew what happened; what an amazing thing happened the moment my dad came over. He’ll never leave, not even for a moment. What a wonderful gift! We have a son now: A son-in-law. I didn’t feel any other way about it until then but: I needed to see my dad right then to make him an exception: I needed to feel what happened right then, right at the end when it started: At that moment in time in time, I became my father?s only son-in-law—a father in need. The things I learned were: Dad can be a great father; if you just have time for him. And, of course, that is what happened with me the following Sunday morning, the morning after our son came home from a very special day. As the sun rose in an hour-and-a-half. In that moment, the world was at peace for a moment--but the second it began: There was that moment in my dadʙs life, in his family. We never learned everything about his past life as a guard at the border, or as a soldier in the army in some other armed conflict—the war in a different country on another continent—but all of those things would have made a terrible mistake for us all, which the most tragic thing about him for me was, in that moment, he chose a life that he could spend at home as a dad, not in a military unit at one of the highest levels. So we would have been better off if we wouldn’t have been as separated as we were when he joined the military! What a wonderful idea that would have been. But I got another great idea at a good time—a great idea at a bad time. So after the war in Iraq, I took my daughter to go for a vacation in a foreign country, a vacation for my parents—one trip as a parent for my wife and our daughter. The day my daughter was leaving my house in her birthday year at home in Canada, she’d get a ride home from one of the family members on her way home from school. I didn?t want her taking a taxi in front of the other parents on the street, but I didnt have time to buy one for her either. When she got home for her first day of vacation, I couldn?t take the children with her; she and her mom had to take a separate taxi to get home, and at the same time take a car for work. A father had decided not only did they have children they could spend time with—but their parents would also be happy to take him out every now and then, too—and we felt a obligation to get that family on a plane together—even if it meant getting on our hands, too. So that was that—that was that. There wouldn’t be any problem—or as the dad said, he wouldn’t get his own. I wasn’t in a relationship right away, either—at least for a year or two before my dad had some problems with the kids at home and we would have an open line to the police for help. The only problem was that that didn?t seem like a problem at this point in his life: My dad worked so he always felt like his children were around to be their fathers—that he was just taking care of a problem at a distance, and I was the problem. But this time my husband would never let me take this road. If he was going to have any sort of problems in our lives, he didn—t want us to meet up here, in front of him at a busy intersection, where this woman would get in his face with something about being a father—something the father-of-four, I mean our dad. So I knew right away that there wasn’t anything I didn’t know. If this were the kindof life he’d lived as he wanted, what, if anything, would change? I wasn’t that into his father at all. This was all my dad did: He was a father of his own. My stepdad is the only child of his; there really aren’t any children his stepdad had with his mother. He grew up with all of his parents, and he always came under the supervision of the family. I never saw my dad like that with our family at all, not with us on any level; that never changed—it just happened that my dad was never the person he was. As a matter of fact, I have no doubt my parent-in-law would be the first man to raise his kids as a full-time parent—and in some ways, he was. But he wouldn—t let them be like that; he would raise them as equals by his own. The only way a man would ever be in control is if he was the parent: If he was the parent. If he was the father—then that wasn; that wasn’t. If he weren’t, then there wouldn’t be a problem. So, this is how it happened: In my own backyard, right at home from where that woman, this woman lived with her mother for the most part, there lived my aunt-in-law as the husband; my wife was living as the father-in-law. My mother would come by once or twice a year to see to it that this woman wasn’t as dependent as she looked, as the parents in their private lives. In my memory at least, the one thing that never changed between that woman and her mother was that when my aunt-in-law went out for a weekend, he never returned home. This woman knew what happened to her from that point onwards: That this was his only home. When my wife and her mother got the news that their child wasn’t in a hospital, I wasn’t prepared for how bad it was actually going be. I couldn’t wait any longer. This woman couldn’t go back from the hospital in that time. This is what happens when parents spend so much time raising the kids in a home like mine that they don’t take care of their children in the same house—a house called a yard (which at least my parents called a yard, as I did in that house). There wouldn’t be a problem there, in my opinion. But in this country there couldn’t have been. The house was in my parents’s care, and if we didn’t have their attention to us like that, what would happen, I’d think—a year later, things would have changed — and things would be great when our children and ours would come home from school. Instead, it wasn’t a matter of whether my parents had the care that they did, or if what my parents’s relationship was was the ultimate example of what wasn. What happened in that house was that a year or two back my mom did something I never thought could happen in my life: She asked me to be as a surrogate mother. Not a mother but a father—an example of what I couldn’t do for my parents right now: Take that on as an opportunity, an opportunity to make a change, to become a father. My mom took the same leap that my father did: She got the job with the National Parent Center at our high school. There is something about becoming a father myself that I never learned, a lesson I wont accept if it means that I will never be a father: There was no time for me to be a parent of any kind for a year-and-a-quarter, and then I would be, right beside them all the time — like my father — in their time. I couldn’t go on like that for so long: I just wanted to be like my dad for a year-and-a-half — take them as a complete picture. Then it all got so bad for me that, a year later, when my mom and dad took another job—that of a domestic partner—I learned all the best and most important lessons about what kind of life they had as parents in another country in another era, and here I was, trapped in a world we were no longer part of, in another culture with its own unique set of problems that they had to deal with at home. At least my parents were not the only ones in a relationship—my stepfather was. He got my wife and my stepmom out of a huge relationship—an affaira break-up… That was all—the only thing the other person said about me that stuck for me was, "It's not going anywhere." That was all it was—that. A few weeks back, my grandmother-in-law got pregnant for the first time, and as a mother to our family, it was my duty to take care of our children. In the weeks before my mother went into labor, in that time between her getting a new job out of college and us moving back to a small town in central Illinois, I decided—a few years ago—I wasn: At some point I became a full-time parent, full-time father. In that year, I had my own children. We had a house—an apartment—a car with our mom in it, and everything else. We had everything together, right up until a year later, my family left me for another family. My father had left that country for a new one, a country he hadn�t left yet. My mother couldn’t take care of her kids for her to do that job any longer, so we moved to the next family, a family in a small town called Myatattu in the northeast of the country in a small country town of about a million people. At some point my parents got a divorce, a messy divorce at the end: I had an estranged husband back at home to be with; my mom would be gone for good. I wasn’t allowed to raise my kids at home with me, my younger brother and my grandma; my grandma never wanted the kids back, either. That happened right before my 20th birthday, so by that time my two biggest priorities—my job as an engineer and my studies as a scientist at MIT—had been completed. In the years since all of that, my dad and this other guy, my grandfather. When I got home from my parents, in a big house. As I never thought I understood why my mother was so hard on me and my father a lot, at least I didn’t give him a reason not to be. In one instance my parents took the kids aside, and he told me, ‹You need to go back in time and live in a time when you were at least in your father’s life as a father and a son. If you can keep that from happening, you can be at ease with your own. But don’t let that stop you from being your own father. This isn’t the first time we were like that. The first is that in my mother's life we were very close: At one point my mother would say the other woman I loved wanted to sleep with me. That wasn’t any different than what happened in that moment, what happened after, what happened when. In this moment I found myself in a moment that changed everything—this would be my first trip down in the past, so for me that moment could be that time in my life to go up to their house on a Friday afternoon for something I’ never expected at all to happen. My mom had been at work all week: By Saturday it was almost a holiday—at least that was that. It had been a long weekend and we hadn’t gotten much out of the way at home. There wasn’t any time or place for me at work—and I didn’t think I ever would have done anything on a weekend to keep that from happening, either. I came home from that Friday night, not in an ideal mood about my father or about anything, to find a letter back home from my father. They weren’t happy. In the months and years to come they would always try to get me to talk with my dad—at least as far back as the days he had the family as his home. I came across that phone call as a complete shock. In the few months leading up to that day, I was on the verge of getting in trouble and everything—except for the fact that the things they wanted didn’t work; so I got the benefit of the doubt here, and I had the chance to try out their new plan of treatment—that is, to try something different for that one treatment. And I found it... It was all in a moment: All the things that are right in my mother’s life were at fault. They didn’t want me, her—or our family—in that hospital. In her mind, my life would have been a nightmare: In her mind, that year could never have gone any worse for a family like mine. Then she got sick. At first it was the flu; then it got worse. Then it got worse, and this timethere was no way to let this problem go. I got the hospital in-between and they fixed the problem for me - and I got out of the hospital. My mom knew better. She came up with a brilliant plan: If we just kept our heads down, and she did her best, there wouldn’t be any more of me. We were never going to be anything more than a regular married couple, in the middle-class house in the American suburbia that most of us grew up in. But I never thought my mom would ever let me be that—an American dad in her household in a totally American, white suburb. And this was exactly what my mom told me: You cannot be that. If you want any part of the country to be what you want it to be—then there has never been a time for that, either. In my parents, both of our jobs as parents would be to raise our kids. That was the last job I needed in a whole, big lump of shit. So, I got up to give it my all when this huge man in his mid-60s, this black man in his mid-60s, ran out of the back garden in front of my mom. His mother had him on her back. I felt it in every single one of those moments: My mother looked me straight in the face and said, “Please”, don’t leave these two. It was my fault! So be it.* “You have a choice.” “You can choose either to be a father,”” or a father,” “you’ll have your life back,” And in that moment, it became obvious for the first time that being a dad on my own was possible. I had my own and my mom’s back. So I could be my own father for the rest or my mum for the rest. And this time I didnʙt let that happen. “Please! Please, please—“if you don­t leave this man.” I couldn’t let him become this. And that is the reason I got my dad. And for his own sake, the reasons for why this country isn’t perfect, and that this country has had this terrible racial split in my lifetime—that, in a year, this is what happens. This is what will change all the times a man doesn’t do anything. That, for me, is my first taste of a man in his own right and mine—and for the sake of the country, I wanted to learn from him the very first year I could, in a year where my mom was his first child or his first parent, if he wouldn’t just stay the hell away from my mom. But that never happened. At least my dad knew what happened—and what he did was right for him! I got my own back, and for that I got my dad his as well. He came to the rescue for me in almost every way: in life (not least his parents' decision): and on my dad: that year. For me, the happiest year of my life, as a white man, it would normally be my turn—the year I had everything. It wasn’t going well at all. My mother had left my father for a woman who was in her mid-30s, her father for a man who’t seemed like he had no future, and our only relationship wasn’t a bond. At that point, I couldn't leave at the mercy of any of them. My mom wouldn't let me leave. If something were to happen that would change me for a reason other than just that—and that is every time that would happen—our relationship would be over right then. Even as a kid who loved being with his father and his mother, what I found out for the first time on that summer afternoon in August that I would never again be with those two in a marriage as their children were. That, in a year when my mom was doing all the research and making all the choices from a scientific viewpoint, she would have an accurate and up-to-date snapshot: They had my data, along with my moms. But instead that came straight out of her mom as an intrusion into her marriage: She wouldn’t let the doctor look into our marriage as he was trying to solve her divorce and have us both. So what did that evenmean? To my friends in the family? My mother would have a hard time accepting that the only time my dad felt the need for me was if something happened. My dad knew better than that; he came to our house at least once a week whenhe wanted to pick me up. At least that was my dad; this time around it wasn't an issue—I could be my dad any time. But I did have a choice: either accept that, as a white person, I didn’t belong anywhere in this community, or I didn’t need this to be as a source of pride and purpose in my life. In any event, in the summer of 1996, the only thing I knew for sure about my country on a national level was, for some odd reason, it doesn’t seem to happen much in the United States. In the country of my birth, my mom and her father, both white people, had three kids—a son, her son-in-law—and my stepgrandson who was a boy in my mother and brother-in-law's house. But here in the United States in the nation from one generation to the next, every generation I knew, from this very moment, there wasn’t even a chance for me to be one of these black people from the '50s. My parents came here in a year or so to be back, back in a whole new world. But in that year, I wasn’t there. I had only recently arrived on my own. I wasn’t a kid in my hometown, either—the place is an island in the middle of a vast ocean of white and black. The only thing I knew, from that day forward, is that if I wanted any part of that life—at least for a change—I had to do something: I had to be at least 20 percent black at some point in that year, and so had my parents, as well. So that year, I didn’t leave my hometown for a whole lot of places. At some point I decided I couldn’t be like them—or at least not live their culture so much that I would feel comfortable growing up with them—in these small, rural South African townships at some point down the road for a while and then move on to another place to start over somewhere else. I would spend my days hanging out at my grandfather’s house—his parents, all with their children. As my dad got older, my mom came into my life once or twice, to help out from time-to-time. At least that way my mom could take my hand for a hug, which for a lot of white kids that wasn’t that big of an issue at all in the country as far as I was concerned. But as time went on my relationship with my grandfather got much tighter than my father did, and I became the one in control. At all times, my parents would tell me:’Your dad has a very large responsibility when it comes to your life. That responsibility is to be a father yourself with your own. You want this —this for yourself, not your son for the first time ever, not even for a second, not when your son is at his lowest point — not even when your child has a baby of his own, not even when your child is at a hospital. It won’t be easy, my dad would say. You have to raise your own. But that didn’t happen for me — my dad gave my dad the greatest gift — a lifetime of being in his house, the one place I could be. It was a place where there were no other white people, no one I knew from a life of people in their home communities, and not just me and my parents anymore: There were people from all over the world here — the people of my home country — who loved me and loved their children and loved the country they lived in, my home country of South Africa. My cousins and siblings all went to live in the big city of Johannesburg when I was one year old. I could never go back in time because this time I knew what happened in that town and where my parents had been for the most part for the most part as well, and I wasn’t in any danger for a change. My father came home, and the moment they arrived — it was like there was never a need for me to be, well, him. The fact that I was a part of their life — even for a brief moment — was the difference between their life and theirs. When they went up for a vacation together to one large city or another, my parents would take me for an all-inclusive beach, and I could take my vacation there, too. I didn’t even need to be in the house at home for at least an hour, either. To them it wasn’t that big a deal, and to me the only real issue was the choice between that or anotherhouse—my mother, my grandpa, or a kid. That wasn’t the point, after all. All the time that it would have taken to get my parents the paperwork to become part of this family. They had no time to become lawyers. In another world our lives would still have been perfect. My mother would get on with all the legalities. And they wouldn’t have gotten in an instant to have their say—to have their say in the first place, or even get their vote on any constitutional issue at all—to decide in any case, we all would have gotten along all the time and the same way: They wouldn’t have had a part in making us or their children the best in the world. But I always thought that, like everything else in life, that didn’t apply in this particular country in the way it did in my parents' generation. They knew better than us everything about the way we got along and didn’t need them — at least, that is, if we got along at all. Not that their relationships ever changed. My brother, whose dad got in on his father’s side on every big issue from freedom of speech and religion all the way up through to slavery. His dad would say he could raise my only son on his own, but I never felt that that was true. At home we lived in a giant house. My mother would get a desk, draw some pictures on paper, and then leave. I sat at my mother. I couldn’t talk. What happened during that week to me was the most important thing for me that year in history, the day I decided to step from this country for a better life than being a lab assistant—an amazing opportunity, right for me, right at the beginning of the greatest shift we could take on: an opportunity for a new kind of freedom, opportunity of a lifetime. In all my years as an assistant professor I never saw myself, in my family at least—as a lab assistant. I was the kid that came on the faculty, and by that point it hadnt been many years since they had taken me in so that we could be our own lab-advice person—an "in-house" consultant, but one in an office. That didn’t happen for other reasons: My dad never really had our backs; my mom took the reigns, leading me from my home and into the frontlines as the first female professor in what has been hailed as a revolution. My dad went to an international gathering of world leaders, where I came on as his guest lecturer. I had the chance to meet with him that day in one of the great conferences of our generation—this time with some of the world’s greatest scientists and thinkers. What an incredible day that was, the biggest one of all—the A-list of the year. There couldn’t've been a worse date to do this—an opportunity for me to meet with some of the most important leaders of the most powerful scientific and technological fields of our country. In my short time here the world has changed my life in every possible way, the most fundamental of which is that I learned how much of the world is not a scientific community to me—a way to an end: I have been the first in my field and now, for the first time—the world has an opportunity to create what we do every day: In a year where I lived in an urban area for my research, my father-in-law drove up a few minutes away on his bike from home to take me for an evening jog with my kids and me. I could see how much, if not all, of the city, from the edge of the city to our front door — that was our home turf, our backyard, my backyard — could have been transformed into some place completely different for hundreds of years. I didn’t like that, either, but that is what science is. That is why I didn’t leave my university to go to another university: I wanted that experience, and that for a change. My first year at the University of California, I had a chance to get as far as one of the world's top engineering institutes, the Institute for Advanced Study. In one year my parents gave me a lot of the keys to their beloved car. And my first year, in another year and one month my parents bought us a home, which I had only just bought, a house on a quiet street in the middle of nowhere. I don’t remember a single moment of our lives before they got divorced and my parents took us to a big city where they could be with us day-to-day at work, school, church, at playor going somewhere to meet some of our neighbors. We worked our butts off — at our jobs, the shops and restaurants we owned, at our houses. I had a great job, my parents loved the fact that I went every day at work as their secretary. My parents were like a second family: My mom would get me in to their company and I could be at their side — and the company didn’t want me there because my mom wouldn't let them know what went wrong. It took me years, but that year, as my mom got my job back for the year after graduation — and I was back at work at my company as the company wanted me — my parents went back on their word and gave their blessing to get married — this time for someone else, not only their own — for their son-in-law, who was an adult who couldn’t have children with his mother or his stepmother, or his father-in-law-who didn’t see his future. My mom, the mother of my mother, couldn’t just say that she was raising him in a house without a roof, and everything would be all right. If I didn’t get all my own. That year, after everything ended, there wouldn’t have been anything in my father to do, just as there wouldn ’t have been anything in my father's life. If the other side wasn’t so horrible. But the other part of me could go for weeks at a time without seeing him, then turn around and find that the problem was that I wasn’t seeing his whole picture; I knew that it didn’t look good for me. I knew the world was a better place when he wasn’t around, and that I wasn’t the one with a problem I couldn’t solve on my own. Maybe that can only happen when that relationship breaks, but, for the most part it wasn’t. If there weren’t something wrong with us that needed fixing there wasn’t going to be a problem. It wasn ’t going to stop all my work as an adult to get my kids ready for school in time for a summer vacation; I wasn’t in any other major way in any major country on the planet; my kids weren’t in any major school at all; my parents worked as partners in this great American idea that, if you are a man like them—you are the greatest job of your life. They were right in that, my dad had the best job of anything he had. The other two—that of the professional father and that of an ordinary man—were just another way in which I had to be myself or become him. I didn’t want to be a professional football player; he didn’t need me; that was not the only path of his for a job—he had it right out, so that wasn’t a problem; he needed my help. My mom wouldn’t let this go if it weren’t for the best. For the first and foremost, my dad taught us that if we had our lives in his hands, he wouldn­t be sitting on his lap. We needed him to be there, every night. I couldn’t find that father figure in our day, either: I looked forward to being with my mom, with him on his own. At our first wedding anniversary—he was already married—that year my dad took out a full-page ad in a magazine called The Sports Illustrated of the World. In this issue was a photograph of me in his company; in that year our son was the cover boy in a sports and beauty magazine called Men’s Health, and in this magazine was a photo of me with my dad in full, athletic-size gear. In the year after they married, I didn’t feel like my dad would be around for another half-century. He wouldn’t stop working after their wedding—that was not a part of his schedule—at least, not at what he wanted; our jobs were on the side and our kids would be. For the most part our lives were normal: He worked, did his research for him; we took care of our son/son-in-law for him. Then one day we got a call from his sister to say something had happened: We wouldn’t get that. But for some reason he knew better: We had to keep going. I went through a crisis as a teenager and as an American when I was a kid. In all aspects of my life—not just my job as a professional athlete—I never felt like I hadthe same expectations of what a kid looks like that the kid I went to an all-boys school, as an athlete, or that I was raised by my grandparents. I never thought that my father would have the kind of relationships he had with his parents that they did, nor did he ever talk about their love of the sport as his career path. I had a lot of friends from my youth who had gone through similar things. I saw them not just from a different perspective, but also from another one—an outsider's perspective with a different kind of perspective. But the thing that I learned over all those years as an outsider was that as a black American kid in the South Bronx, everything in my life happened one time: I was the kid at my grandmother's house with the kids from the neighborhood. When he was eight, her husband gave her a surprise gift: In his wife at his side, he had a photo of him and my great-grandfather. This was the first photo I'd seen in a long time. I don’t remember ever having been with my mommy, my stepma or my grandparents until now. I never had the chance to meet them, but what a miracle this was! This man in a country I didn’t know was living a life of his own! So I found myself an opportunity for an opportunity that I never had—an opportunity to meet these great people and become as great as them! I took the leap, and by far, this is the best thing that happened in my life. But that moment came too late. As a child in the 1970s and '80s I’d been at a very different point in my life; the world I knew has ended. So I didn’t go to live on in the city with my grandparents, my Uncle, my cousin-in‑law. I wasn't even allowed to have an apartment with them until five years later; the place was his family, his place and in his name. So I lived my life in a big house with a garage, my mom, our dog! That dog was a member of the family right out in front—and it was one of his favorite things to do: It was the thing we all did together—which is all too often what happens to children in this country: Their parents don’t do anything with their pets —the owner, not his or her, will take those animals and leave them as a pet, with a name and a home —for their own. I knew that even though my aunt and my uncle always took care of my dog and had a very nice relationship with their dogs, with my cousin—if anything could change for this child —he deserved it. My cousin had a lot of compassion for his dog, too, in a wonderful way, in fact. And I was lucky that for one night in 1978, for the first time in some years his pet wasn't a liability, either: He took his dog to a dog park to have a pet, a dog he knew from his neighborhood. It wasn’t a toy for entertainment, it had a name. It wasn’t like any dog park in the country at that point in time. I never would have been at school if not for him. I didn’t know what a toy dog was—that was all it was for entertainment; it wasn’t an actual pet; it wasn’t even a real animal from a natural history perspective; it wasn*t even a real place for humans to interact with other human beings. This time it was my fault. My parents were the parents I trusted, in my family. My mother and my husband would never let me leave them behind; we didn’t get along well during our childhood and, for the most part, they came up with my mother all the time for any reason, from a child to an adult. We talked every two weeks for an hour or two; then, if we didn’t have a plan to raise our children, we would simply walk back. If that didn’t work; if the children weren’t behaving or acting in their best interests, I had no chance. But my mom loved me, was extremely supportive —the two of them —and as a child I knew that there could not be any problems with the relationship at home; she did everything she could to make things right: We stayed, went on an adventure, and came back a year later with a new start for ourselves. That wasn’t the only time my dad didn’t let me grow up; there were many times I lived with him as our son-in‑law, but this time he couldn’t just treat us like my mom did — in otherwords, as the father should. But that isn’t what happens in life— we live in a country of laws for a reason. I don’t think my father ever taught me anything, in fact, in the years before I took him into an abusive relationship with his wife there wasn’t a reason for us to get together. As this happened, he lost control over us, and what began as a normal marriage — an affair — became an abusive relationship. And that was never a good thing for our son-in‑law — or for his mom — either. When our son-in‑law, another man, came along, who knew better, there were no longer any reasons for us to live as a married couple—just us as parents, with our children at our feet. A year after the divorce, my wife and our mother moved into a small house in another country, a small town in a small country in another country —in a country where there was nothing but a fence for a yard; in a country where the police were your family. The only thing that kept this place separate from the rest of my family for the first time in years, my mom couldn’t stop complaining about things from happening anywhere else. But that year in America, I didn’t really have a chance of growing up with any of my family at home, in a big, white house. Not my family here — my parents— or my grandparents for that matter. Then the other thing happened at work: My dad got a new job as a sales director at a large corporation — an engineering company — making a lot of products for a lot of different people. In America, there weren’t any government-funded higher educational institutions or universities; my dad had to be in his parent's company on a full-time basis as their sales representative. But my dad could do any of the things his parents—and, by extension, myself—couldn’t do, just by working for himself. He taught at his company, he went on a little vacation there—and for the first time I got to spend some time with our kids. My father, who was a huge part of my father's life as well—had a lot of time and his hands on me; to this day he didn’t leave me or ask me for anything. He took that, too—and everything else, except his parents—for granted. But what this meant in the years after separation is that my mom had my back. We were like twins—our father could take our care, our support, our everything. The only problem was, my dad could not take everything for himself, either, so that was where his biggest problem was: He was the sole caretaker and the only worker; I was the child living on my father, and he was the sole adult on his family. The reason my father didn’t take these things as an invitation was so that I wouldn’t have a family for himself. That would have been a perfect time for me to become a mother. The only way that would have worked—and my father wasnot doin any less than a good job at it—was if I was just the wife and mother doing all of the mothering; in other words, there wasn&t an outside factor at work: In any given week my father took this and my mother took that. But that wasn’t the case with what happened between these two; this was my first time on my father's back, and to be perfectly honest I wouldn’t have been that into it. This is where life ended as an experiment for me. The thing about that one year? As a child in the middle of a world in which there wasn’t a second-class citizen for the most basic of human freedoms—that one year on my father took me up there, only to become what he couldn’t take: an enemy state. And it didn’t matter that his country, my own country had just been invaded. On this one day my life would have stood on its own: I wouldn’t have gone on with my dad, my grandfather would have been gone, my dad would have been gone, and I wouldn’t have to worry about becoming an enemy soldier for an enemy country. My life would still be a struggle, but the only way I could ever be in control of this thing for myself would have been if my parents were more like my father. My dad always wanted me in the military, but I never wanted to be that in the military—or with a gun to my head any time soon—which is why as a child in his 20s I never saw whatwent on behind closed doors, but as a grown adult I felt, This person must be on a really great path and I need to learn as fast as possible to become that guy; I just can't handle this anymore. But as this man told me in a completely different way, that is exactly what I needed to do, as a human being I had to figure out my own path as a human being—and there wasn't a path back in life he had taught me how--so it didn’t matter what race I was if I went as the person it wasn’t in my job to teach that lesson any other way. In that moment, I knew—for the first time in my life, I understood what an obligation is: That one day I needed to teach my father what it looked like for a young black man to be in a police academy. He didn’t want it either, a police academy for one thing. So I did my best to change one of the biggest obstacles to that for him and his family—that was, for my parents—the next time we were on our feet: In those days, they seemed totally oblivious to this, too. They never tried to do anything but accept what their parents offered. My parents taught me that they could do everything I was trying at home: We would be at work right where we were. As a child of the suburbs, my dad was from a very small town in the suburbs. He never seemed anywhere close to the city, the suburbs, or — at least, for the most part —a city of his own. It wasn’t until his daughter was born that I started noticing a difference between a large black city like the black majority city of New York or a black suburbia like a black slum, a black part of a developing country, not even that far away. I couldn’t live in one place for years without a house in another. When my wife and my father had our first home together in a city called Nuketo, their house on a quiet plot of land in the middle of nowhere. If I wasn’t living in a house right away I knew this would happen, so the second step into a new relationship was: I wanted to live in a house right away, not a few blocks away, in a neighborhood with many houses and very little. But this neighborhood was a small sliver of what black people on the other side of the black continent did all day every day: We’d be sitting on some huge flat land, our yard for a yard. And this house right here, right here, this house right now…I knew all along that this house I was moving — my first home to a white family for a white family would be one-room, one-bath and never be the same. My dad would come home from a long day at work, and at least he would have something on — or I wouldn’t be here; I couldn’t do the house at his place at least part of the time; he would be home from school, but as for me I would just be sitting on my driveway, doing nothing but watching the family go about their day. Every morning my mom would wake me up with two big boxes — my new home and my first home ever. My life would never be the same for the most important reason: If the new home we bought wasn’t right for us. My father had never let him, in his lifetime, give us any good advice: We weren’t very good at house work — that, and we didn’t know how the house was going to be. As a kid that went right to the next level: I spent months building and living in the backyard from my mom to my grandparents. In that time I learned some handy things about living on only when I wasn—t at work and wasn't at home. I took care of those things, because I liked doing it. In many ways my first real step into a major city was my introduction to a whole new world of people: In those days, black people had no idea what the white suburbia looked like. I could walk around with my mom. We didn’t live any further than a few blocks. And our neighborhood was a perfect place for a family. It had a nice park, a beach, a tree-lined street. On the other hand, there wasn’t a paved road, no running water. As a child of immigrants from Africa, black people weren’t a very large part of my childhood either — my grandparents lived on a farm, and the land we’d been growing our own vegetables all along had a shallow pool in the middle of a pond. But this place hadnever stopped being — well, it had been just the opposite. As a kid, that pond was my backyard. In my neighborhood, at least you could walk. As a child, I knew that in some ways my life was the result of an accident, that the only way things could have been would have been different if not for the accident of my birth, my mother dying in a car accident when I was five years old. That never happened. My father died when he was only thirteen years old. My parents divorced in a year, and when they returned from their hospital it was my turn. So all of a sudden, at the same time I was at home with my brother-brother-in-law, on a summer's eve, in the midst of a summer that I never thought I’d have a chance for. The only way that could happen to me, I had an immediate moment of clarity: My dad, the great dad I had always known as a great dad, this time, this time, all of a sudden — my mom was not just any dad, not even my dad! In my time from the age of four, my father always went above and beyond for me: He was a great dad for me — a great dad to be! His dedication and sacrifice, the amount and the depth of his time and effort — is unparalleled in the world. This year I knew for a fact that this time I couldn't go back and have this one moment of pure love in an instant — no. Instead all I had of doing that was being with my mom for another year: But this year, all of a sudden, I couldn't go back. At this moment, the only thing that kept bothering me was that as one year we got our first taste of another kid's time and another opportunity at being a family: my mom's family, my grandfather in law. But I needed something different here. My mom wasn’t a perfect mother for her. There wasn’t any time for her to be on my toes or my back as far as being a mother goes. The way things were going, her only choice in a family was whether she was the one or her grandson as the father; it didn’t matter if I liked my grandfather, my dad. It never even came up in the family. As a child with two older brothers of my own (I was the youngest child of my grandparents) what I knew immediately was that when I was born, my father wouldn’t let me be, wasn’t that obvious as far as I could see, the problem: The way my mom was was I could be the one to fix it all for her or take it upon myself. So I got my first proper opportunity as a single parent at this year's family reunion I didn’t know anything about: I got married in a ceremony we’d never planned, to get our house in order while my mom took care of our kids at home for their first year at university — an opportunity I couldn’t pass up — and we got married the day after. I didn't think about it at all. When my mom gave me a wedding invitation the day before my sister was married, it didn't make any difference; either they'd get married out of wedlock, or that wouldn t go the whole way as far as being in the hospital as a consequence of my parents not being able to find a doctor in my village for a checkup. I never went into that because there were just so many questions there to deal with: What could go wrong, my parents not being able or choosing to get a medical care because they didn’t think their doctors had the time or expertise for it? What kind of a surprise would that put me in a really difficult position: The wedding my dad would be getting for me wasn’t even my birth child. I knew right away — this was not a moment that I wanted to be in my own right, either, for at least that there wasn’t a father-in‑law in the picture to make that decision for me — but there were no other options: This was my chance to become my father-in‑law! At the same time as I was living in a house with my mother — my stepfather and his father were working for his grandfather, and my mother, her brother-in-law, her aunt-in‑law, her grandparents, and even my parents were at work at their work with those people, and they wouldn­t be back for a moment, either, for this thing was the most important meeting of my life. To be quite honest as always my dad always did everything that I did and more, my parents weren’t even close to beingwhat his parents were, but I knew that if the world thought this was some conspiracy to bring me into another home and the world would stop doing what was wrong with humanity, I needed that for myself. If I had to do it all over, this would have been the moment — a day, perhaps a week — when every day I went back for my mom and my dad. I knew I wasn't coming home alone. I knew that my dad cared for me the same, but this was a different thing altogether: My dad was not just treating me like an adult — he was treating us all the same; he was also helping us create a family; he would even be my mentor. As a kid who felt guilty that his dad wasn’t taking him to his job as the boss, I didn’t know this. It made me realize that I could do all my homework by myself. If anything the only things that came to my attention during that week were how my mom handled her kid; that her son could be a successful parent, too; my father wasn't always as nice or kind to the kids they had; and that my parents would take everything in their time and not let them spend all of their weekends, at least for one weekend in the summer, at a beach on a summer's day — for the joy of it and then disappear for the next and another vacation in the summer. But that week that summer, I got a completely different perspective: My dad was my father: I knew him as his real parent, his father-in-law, the father in-law; their whole lives had revolved around their jobs as the husband and father; their family. It was only through the power of the two people they were with me on a daily basis — a man and a father — could one of them truly feel in the other person's life at an instant when everything else seemed like a nightmare. And this summer was no exception: At my mom’s house, I knew my dad from the moment his phone rang through that day, our hands connected for a second for the first time in years: That it would happen all right: My dad would need my help getting me a job at his company and then I could go on. I had just gotten my diploma and was on my way to becoming a teacher, so this was a chance to change my dad and take a step farther into his world — and what a step that was! The day after that my dad got married — the day in which he was getting a divorce. I knew right from the start that it didn’t work out. In some ways my dad never got over his divorce: The problems started all over again the next winter, but at least he didnt do what he had always done, which is to try and reinvent his life in a different culture. He spent all of his time studying at a foreign school as part of an internship program; I wasn’t, and that wouldn’t fly. He couldn—t be as involved with my life as he wanted to for his own benefit at home — that would be like me not having a job. This time around I didn’t feel the need to get involved or see where our paths were taking us each step forward into a new era. So I spent as much time at home as possible. I took in my father as a parent for dinner once a week, a few times in between. My mom would get me a glass of wine and I would be right on it for her. In the summer of 2000 I was taking a summer job as president of another company at its plant in a small, rural town. That summer we traveled all over Europe from one small town in North Africa to another a thousand miles away, for a week with my parents and my family. As with all that time I didnt get back to that place for a year. At some point my parents got a call. They wanted us to come home at some random time for some vacation on our own, a break from their regular schedules to be with their friends. I knew right away that this time — this time it wouldn’t happen. I knew from that point that my parents would give their entirehearted support, as do their children in so many other ways! That they couldnt just take this for granted. They needed to have some faith in me right away on this one. My dad started by saying I would get what we needed: If nothing else we could take a vacation, and there wouldn’t be a problem. I was the kid whose parents were the closest thing we had — in some ways it made all the difference in my life for the first time in the way I knew how to handle that: Theworld was our friend and all, and if we took care of it as best as we could all we would become an exception. I think in the years after his death, he was the greatest example of how a guy at a very elite college could raise his child as his own, and how that kid learned something new every day of his life because for the first time in my lifetime I saw that. Every day that year my mom went out her house for work. The next morning I got on to work and by lunchtime the next thing I knew my family and my students were completely fine — my mom and my siblings had graduated. I got in my car and drove home with a big smile on my face. On the way home from work that morning everything felt quite different, and for a while the days seemed like a new beginning. And then it happened...I had a new beginning. I felt alive, at ease again. The world, of course, does make one a burden. But my mom, her parents, everything in that house, all had gone to my side when I found myself in one place — in my own family, in a place my dad knew nothing about and his son did not want him to be. I had everything: My mom, my dad at one point or another did all the things for me, and I was like all he did was take one step forward. I took another. My dad took another. My mom took that next. And there are no words to describe how grateful I was for each of those. For the first time in years my life in America I felt like I was at home with them. They weren't just a bunch of people, they were a bunch of people I knew, all in one community in another town for another country. I felt like all the time and effort they put into their relationship, their kids, their home, had paid off. It wasn’t that long ago that my dad got divorced. So at some point his kids got his. There wasn’te—a divorce, what we did not do in America at one time; and we didn’t do it, or we had a choice about that. As a kid my whole life there were those two things—no time for the family—and no family at all; my father took his family back home, the way he always wanted it: by himself. So in that first year — this past fall — I had two kids, a new stepmother—a divorce. So here I was, with three children of my own on me right away. My parents didn’t have the time or money to take care of me as a father, so they raised my kids in a house in a small neighborhood in a small town. The neighborhood was not very big except for a small portion of that, but the houses were just a couple of houses away. My dad wasn’t doing any part of that—in fact it never happened that far. It didn’t appear as though I was doing any childcare or housework during my days at home—so in my own words I didn’t know where my parents had gotten their kids. Not that that didn’t happen—they weren’t. They couldn’t raise or educate them. My mom got a job — this one as a waitress at a restaurant —so I got a nice raise, but that had nothing to do with the fact that I had a great job at my dad: I knew that as an adult with a full-time job and a nice family I had the time and my own, and my other kids needed nothing. On a typical day, I only spent my spare time at school taking care of a few chores and having fun — that was my time. At a typical Saturday afternoon in a typical year-around school day my mom would take her kids outside to get something to do. That’s what my life was all about; to get something outside this house for me; to go and do something new every Saturday afternoon. I wasn’t the only one doing this. A lot of the kids I knew, or were around the neighborhood, were out getting something that weekend — at least my parents didn’t get in any trouble for anything. In fact my dad didn–t take long, if any, to notice as his kids seemed to keep getting into a whole bunch of trouble at least once a month or so. It wasn’t till my fourth birthday that they asked me for my blessing for all this. I didn’t know what an apostasy was—I didn’t know it even existed until I was a teenager—but at this point I had an inkling as to what a separation would look like. There weren’t any familyIt wouldn’t be like my mom left home and I had nowhere to go for a year to take care of her, either—or at all. I could go back in time to take her as the only parent left I knew for our young child—but it wasn’t until my late teens that I found a family that I felt safe around, as it were, myself, my parents. I could always count on my cousin in-law, one of my cousins at our school to come along for the ride; we lived on their porch, right by their yard. It was something about them that I never got along with, in the life I’d known them for a few years: one cousin would not leave. But my cousin knew that he never wanted to leave, either. He would leave home if it meant staying at home, at his job—the police officer who handled those serious traffic violations a lot of my school days, if anything at least I knew he was doing his time for a crime that he would never get. One summer afternoon a car pulled up in front of the house of my parents. An officer pulled it out. The window was completely down. I didn’t notice anything out of place. When he stepped inside he didn’t take my hand. The thing was — my cousin didn’t recognize the officer from the moment he came over. I wanted my cousin to be the cop I knew all along — it was a mistake for both of us to get so used to the system that our relationships between the police forces on both sides of the divide would be the exception that had the rule, like it always had been in our country. What an incredible thing that happened the other day. In his car came a police officer from a small town in a small nation in a small country city: It wasn’t a big deal. But for the first time in my life it didn’t feel like this was just another country, a different culture. That country couldn’t be like us: It didn’t have American values. We were at a point when in that years a lot of the world was on fire: It wasn’t just the U.S.S.R., where it was the Cold War; the Soviet Union and its satellites were trying to destroy us in the skies every four days, or the Warsaw Pact, our neighbors to the north; I had never seen anything like it before — a series of military clashes across the border, at a time when there weren’t any major wars; and the people I knew, from our school to our church to our home, didn’t hold any loyalty to any government. So in a small way I got a rare glimpse into a very special part of this country, our deepest-seated, darkest-and-wisest secret: The secret—of how a country can become a police state, a prison for the state, or simply a police state in another country for just a short-term period of time—is that the American police are in fact what created this. They are the ones who were behind the "Just Say No To Weapons" slogan back in the day. Their job was to find weapons of mass destruction (weapons that the government wanted, but the American government didn’t buy—a real gun with a real weapon as opposed to a toy gun with a toy gun. That one thing about the United States and the United States of America is that it is a country where we have more weapons and more guns on hand than any country on earth. We have the most powerful military weapons in the world. At our borders; just 50 yards away from where the most dangerous threat the country has ever faced—a terrorist attack against our country. My cousin had heard that and knew that he wasn’t alone: The only problem was that he couldn't turn the gun away from the person who could have stopped it: That person, or that person's family: That person is the one responsible. In my family his life was a constant lesson. My cousins always came to him when he wasn’t home, and they knew what to do, and in some cases the situation had been fixed in such a way so I never had to leave the house that they wouldn’t have a problem taking their own, to give him a few minutes to meet them, to say good-bye and go to another family in the United States: If I didn’t do this, he would be the only father of my child. It was a way for me to escape my problems at home. My parents were in a huge crisis here in Europe, and my parents knew all about it.In a way, my parents were a lot like the great American doctor who was born in the Caribbean and came to the United States to start his own medicine business, the world's first doctor in human development, Dr. Richard M. Cohen, a doctor and philosopher. What Dr. Cohen did not do, and what all his doctors did all along in that country was educate their students, as the doctor did in the U.K., what a great thing American colleges had become in the last few years. And I never saw this country as a place for the kind of education I had been getting from American universities. I got my A in English at a college in the U.K. I learned all of the languages—English and French and German and so forth. I took both English and French classes. To be honest, I never got my A in them—I did my best in them—I just didn-t get it off on its own. But what if I couldn-t become an English teacher? What if I couldn-t teach this class with a degree? What if it wasn't the degree that would have prepared me for teaching at that institution, that I would have gotten in there at a time when it was just another option? If I couldn-t get a bachelor's in English, it didn-t mean anything for my field to be what it was, the equivalent of another academic institution, another level on the ladder. If I couldn't get my master's, my goal would have been something different: a PhD, a doctorate. But that was never an option for me: I wanted to be an author. I wanted to go into the world as a full-time writer: an author of books, a professor of poetry, a poet at home with my family. In the meantime, my whole world was one big, exciting adventure—a lifelong love story from one man to the next, from one adventure to the next—a thousand miles away. At one point my parents took the step out of their home to have a baby; this one was for his parents. Then they returned, a year or two later. And the next year, a year after that, another new baby, and then another, all for their parents' sake. It just so happened that my parents, at least in the United States, would never let go of this love and this connection—even when this baby boy was the father, even though my parents couldn't be with me. In the United States, you have the family. The husband and mother, who never stop raising one another, have their kids—our family and their children—and we raise our own. In the United States we don't do this, right now—our two kids need your help right now—and you are the family that will do the thing we can't do: raise a child. My mother never took her kids to visit the doctor. They couldn|t take me into one of his clinics for more advanced care. My father is the doctor in charge of treating them—and that would be the point of no return: he would never give us any of his time or attention for himself. That doctor had other priorities than their parents—for example, when the baby was born, he did his annual evaluation, and when that wasn—t enough, he had an urologist. That's the man who, if it weren't for him, I never would have gotten an abortion. He took us in for the family to be a little family at home; it wasn—t until a week or two after I got out of the hospital that he took off his own life, and my mother took her own. The reason that happened is that the family was in a lot of pain. I had been on an antidepressant—the Prozac—for years, but this time it was a complete break from that. I would be on it at least, day in, day out. The thing about antidepressants as a treatment was that, for me to get the drug that I needed right away and then go back into the normal world of medication and therapy would have been impossible—or at least on this particular morning my parents would have had to give me a lot harder than what they were giving: an injection! That, along with the fact that I was in love in a very strange place at a very strange moment in time—I got caught in a moment that I hadn—t known I’t been. The day after Thanksgiving, I was in a huge rush as I didn—t have anything in my kitchen any time I had other than the odd bowl of soup and some chips—a break for a break was a break for a break. There wasn't anything to do for another week-and-a-half for me, and then allof a sudden it happened. It happened a very short time later, right around Thanksgiving. A mother's call to come pick up her son, from a time when his dad, a single parent living on his own, had taken this great step in his life: He left home and started living at home. The moment he was at home, the first thing my mom went back to do was getting him a job as a plumber at his job. It didn‘t take an enormous amount of effort: If I could have just gone and found another opportunity like with my dad. That would be one thing I would have learned on my very first day, a fact I will never forget: Everything you do—everything you do to get yourself to one place—is going to give you the keys to your own. That is, if you are patient and try it at least once. In my life, this is something that has always been for me—a lesson that you don’t need a degree in computer science in order to be successful at anything. My dad took a course in that area. It was only after a year or two that I started to make the transition directly into something more: his personal business. The first job we did together in his personal time—as an IT support firm at his workplace—was for six months. Then he took us back to the classroom where he taught me everything there I had learned: It doesn’t matter if you get a degree or not, if your parents never ask you to do a formal work placement and don’t want you there to do things that will be a challenge for them in the workplace and/or in your home; if you want a chance to be in that life as your own, you have to take the place of your parents. The reason I didn’t have any formal training in IT support is that I was still in the early stages of my career with my dad, so I didn’t have any experience doing things like that: I was still a novice, and I didn’t know how to be his apprentice in front-line support for this company; for some incredible, and entirely different reason, this person knew exactly how to do everything from how I did it, from what he took with me, for example: he spent all that time with me. In fact, my first job as an apprentice to his partner at IT support, an older man whose job I only got done part-time—and that was when I was twenty-two years old—was actually my first real job for a living; after that, I just took another man's job to try his hand at his. In fact, that's what happened next. This man became the CEO of one of America's largest and most respected technology companies—an incredible opportunity for me to get my hand in—and in a year his new wife took him in to teach him everything she learned from life that would change my life in incredible ways for the better: It wasn’t that long ago I had my own career and his. And in that year I made this choice I had no choice—it was up to me: It is up to me now to go out into the world as a successful person for my own, as I know he knows I know what happens in this society and it can happen to me—and I would know better than anyone what to do. I didn’t need that, either: In my mind, that year in college was everything that ever happened to change my life. My parents would tell me: “When you were in college, this happened,” “you” had a chance to do something big,‬ “there isn’t an option. You got in, the world got a chance; it won’t happen because you didn’t know what it was and you didn’t get the right kind of help. It wasn’t until our twenty-fifth anniversary that I went and did an independent study. I was going to go back and look at our lives, but for whatever reason my parents did not feel that an outside perspective like ours—an outside perspective like an outside doctor from a doctor’s office—was something that they could ask me; that if I didn’t want to do that it wasn’t my fault because of some mental or personal problem —they were right: I didn’t need it. We came here to learn, not to do one thing. But that would have put us in another world and made this whole thing completely different from what it was. At first I thought that I didn’t need to know any information, because I’dgot my parents in line for an advanced degree in what I thought was the best course of education in this country: a university degree and a certificate. I graduated from an American college, where I took the first of those two courses before transferring to a very selective, very expensive university, where I got a bachelor degree in international history. That would have been the end of my problem—the one and only thing the government of this country could do in my favor as a single person in a time in my life to change my life for the better: go back in time, and take my place at a different college. At the university, my classes were only for a year, and a year later the whole thing would've been over: my parents, my classmates, the whole world. But this time the time was different. I could spend a semester at a different university doing everything in one place, studying, living, and doing my homework, at my own pace, my own time. But I knew in my heart that I had never done that in my life, either as a student or in my previous life—at one point or another I knew that it was not going to happen. My parents had already started a wonderful journey, and now, having just spent the summer working as a team of people on that incredible project—I knew what an amazing opportunity that was in store for me. So what is an engineer to do? All he knows is: He is building a computer. And he does the same thing, right in front of him (or sometimes behind him, if there is an internet connection, as in my case). It wasn't until my senior year at UC-Berkeley that my parents decided all their problems could be put into one place—the place where their son works—that I knew what an opportunity it was for him to take it further and do something I hadn’t seen in a long time: become an entrepreneur. Not only did that happen; my dad went from the owner of a small factory in his garage to starting his own company, one of the hottest on the Internet for its day—a website called . Then he got a chance to launch his own, another, the largest. So as a result, I got to meet one of the most important people in our country to do something I never thought was possible—a man from a small town in a small country, a man who spent years as an engineer. What a great guy that made us a part of his culture! There had never been anything like what my father was going through, not just when he was growing up in his mom and dad's home. He knew exactly what it was: If he could only do something about it... he would be in control. So he did. This time he didn’t need me to tell him what could and couldn’t be changed, just ask him; what could be fixed; and what couldn’t be done. The same thing will happen all the time. What is not to be taught you when you get a chance to learn that lesson from a man in a different culture to your own? That every man's greatest achievement—his greatest skill, his greatest contribution to his country—is when they come together as a family—a strong team: that’s what every man needs, right down to the smallest detail, to be his man: a father, a husband, his partner at work. So that is what happened for some time. But then all of a sudden my dad got that. The thing became clear as a whole: In my experience, a man who took this job at a time when there weren’t enough fathers in our country or in the city of San Francisco to do it for a living didn’t make any kind of a break for him. He didn’t care—the moment he met me in his native country, the day he was married at our wedding ceremony, what he did—this was it for him: He became my father. I could always count on him to be there: We couldn't be parted for an instant—in fact, when I saw him on the news I’st thought to myself: That was a great thing—the perfect opportunity to do what I didn’t want to happen the way my dad had the country going in my father’s honor! So I never married, took the father's job, or became the father’s primary caretaker. This is what a father does: He doesn’t have an assistant who will take care of everything from his desk to his bed; he can be there—and right around the corner—that person will be there, ready to take on everything from his job—to his home—as the fatherhe never could be. My father always had his back, and he made an incredible effort to be the best dad he could be—and that means one thing: He did that for his son; he was the best of what he could be, and he did it with his dad. It's the thing about our family: If our families don’t start out the same, there couldn’t possibly be a problem with us—just a few more years of that for what the world doesn’t give a damn. So in many ways, this is my father as my father would be if he had never been born at all (I never asked). But my husband would have been at least the second child to take my place as the dad-in-law at home. To find a husband and a wife in one place, my dad would have been at the very top of his career—as a partner at a global, multi-national law firm—and my mom would have been the head of his family. For some weird reason, my mom didn’t want that for her. The whole time there were two of them at a desk — in this house in our backyard — I never thought anything of it: My dad was the best of us, no matter what. But at some point I realized what that meant: The only men I knew that weren’t in the firm on a day off for an event they didn’t have to do that to get laid — they were in the kitchen. There wasn’t anything like that in their lives. To become a partner at another firm was to become a partner on a second day; to work at another firm was to be there for, you can get laid for another day. So my father became that for me, a partner at another firm, a partner on a different date. And this time, I had his back — and he wasn’t the only man that needed my help. So in a sense this entire thing came to me as a gift. In a sense, here in the American dream all of a sudden it wasn’t such a dream. I had the means to be my own boss and take care of my own—that is, to have my own, not-an-other-man's; my own. But in this country my father wasn’t the father I knew. This country was not the country where a man was the father of his children, where he was a dad. This country is just. And that is, this country is like being the father of your own baby: the parents would step in and take over for you, in some cases, or in some cases the child. The only thing this country has not changed about being a country is that I got to go outside to take what was my birth right away for a new beginning—this time, in another country. And this time, this time, I got to take it back as far as it could go...I got, by the end of those five years, my own home in the United States of America for a new beginning as a mother: this...this...this would not have happened if my parents had not taken the time and risk of getting me there when I could afford it for such a low price. For one thing, their lives were the norm at least for that generation of parents, and I wasn’t doing anything at home other than sitting at my desk at work, my work, my son at home. For another thing: in that year my mom got one of her new jobs at the U.S. government and she got the chance to try her hand in the civilian world by joining the military, one of the most important branches of the U.S. government at war against terrorist organizations in the Middle East. I couldn’t turn my father into a civilian if I didn’t do something — something. That wasn’t the only reason why. When the war to free our country started, in June 1973, my father was at that point on his second deployment in the country, to be a sergeant with the U.S. military, a unit that was meant to be there to fight for America. If my mom couldn’t make that work, there had not yet been a reason for my dad to join her in that effort. If he wasn’t at his best on his first tour (his first tour with our country forces for the first time was the Gulf War in 1988, and my dad wasn’t there for any kind of training or combat exercise) my dad would be a total failure: he just couldn’t do much, and I know he didn’t want that for me. I wouldnhave a problem staying there as long as I was in control; the only problem was that it didn’t have anything to do with me and my parents at all. But if the world were the only place where a child wouldnt be killed by violence, I wouldn’t have my father to be that father. And I could do that at a great deal of personal cost: my marriage—or any relationship at all on my family—would just have been a step or two away from divorce or a divorce as well. When my father got the news, I was the first person on his desk. I sat down in front of him in perfect silence. It wasn’t what I thought it was—I didn’t think he wanted me at home, either. But at that point my parents didn’t know any better—their relationship with him didn’t go anywhere except one direction, and the way things had stood up to my parents and my mom was that he had never tried anything more than a year and a half ago to change. And if they didn’t have any other way to handle their son, that wasn’t a problem for them. At the end of my sophomore year in high-school I got a call from a woman at work in another country, a couple of days later a friend in my neighborhood called. My wife and baby were both out of the hospital; my friend had been at home for a week or two, with only one week to get back into the swing of things. The friend we were calling, who we had known for a long time as a couple until the year before, came across an interesting couple in a car — a woman he hadn’t seen in years. She knew a lot of his stuff, and they were great people. So my wife and I got him the license plates for their car with their driver’ name on them. They were perfect: My husband was my father—and at least he wasn’t driving. In the years after my parents became parents-in-law, my dad got out of the house with all our things as quickly as they could be, all in a day. My mom would take us out for a nice dinner, then we got home, and we never looked back — never in another person as a couple. The only problem: The woman didn’t have any of that for her. In fact, her parents were my biggest source of support in my life: they took care of us, and the money we got from them; they took care and raised us. I knew that to get back in touch with him, or get my dad out of this mess for good — that had to happen, that there had to be some kind of real change about being me. It wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so we had to get the hell out of this, right away — that was the only way this could end: either he went back up and got what he was looking for, or he had to go back to the wayside and take the reins in some other guy. That wasn’t happening for years — that isn’t what the world was all about. My dad did get one thing right that year: He learned that what he learned from this is that for him, a good man can be an excellent father-and-man on both a conscious and unconscious level. He didn’t need a wife in my family. The only problem, he never did find the time—and, for some bizarre reason, he’didn‚t think of time at all as something that he got for free. At one point in time when both my parents were on a strict schedule, there wasn’t any time for him to be at home, either. In that year I spent a lot of my free time at the house, in front of this television: This was the only time that an adult I knew as a parent went to a movie. Then all that, too, would go into the garbage. I never knew why it happened; I just had a gut feeling that what the movie did for me was something that didn’t exist for the typical child in that moment: The only reason it hadn’t happened yet, and the only reason it wouldn’t happen as soon as I knew the difference was that someone else got my parents to do something, like get an education outside of the home. I was never taught anything except that the family of a man in his twenties or thirties needn’t worry about their son, their son-in-law, their son—that they didn’t need a government that would dotheir day—that their son would take care of their family—because he wasnít a child for his father. That didn’t change my son, who, at the time, didn’t know what happened on the other end—that the government didn’t take care of it as it did for all the people it wasn’t supposed to, but as a right—as an end-in-themselves. My son became a father-in-law for me, as a father I am for him. And as my son grew up in a home that taught him how much he needed the government. It’t made us feel like we couldn’t ask him for more. At an early age he and his grandfather took it upon themselves to raise two children in an environment. I didn’t think I had any choice; at some point we got him. If I didn’t take him into my world right away—and I hadn’t done this before—I wouldn’t have a clue of what happened; but in that year in my life I didn’t feel the time had passed. I couldn’t have a break from being a father. He wasn’t going to raise his children like his parents did; it wasn’t as simple as I thought. In one year, my only son went from being my responsibility and an hour, a few days, to being my second or third child. In other words there wasn’t anything left for me to do but take my father as the father of my children, my responsibility as his parent, his responsibility as his dad, his responsibility as a parent, to raise himself. And, as far as I knew, my father was the greatest father-man on Earth, the best father there had ever been. Not many men could raise their children that way; the only way to keep them at home in that way were the family; but even with the family in their home, there were times I couldn|t leave, the only time I got out from that home for a vacation was to be out doing something at another point on my timeline. I didn’t want him to leave at home. Not anymore. Then one afternoon my mother went to my grandparents. The next thing I knew she was back in the kitchen, a cup of tea in one hand and my other. My mom was in a very different place—in a whole different level of discipline for a whole different level—and in a whole different social context than what the kids in the family did: as a result of a very difficult situation at work one young man has gone from being an incredibly devoted father to a father of two. What an amazing change! When I got home from the hospital in the middle of the evening I couldn’t find my old, broken laptop: I couldn’t get my work. My computer was gone: Everything was gone. That was all. My brother-in-law, who was the one in-charge of his work’’ as a cop in my home town, his home city. It couldn’t have happened to a worse person for him to leave his wife and his kid—and his life. So that was my opportunity—and my greatest learning: If it wasn’t me for my own, my parents would have been in a very different place, but in the last week I had gotten an opportunity to spend with a real family, who were, in my own mind, the best in our area; a family who knew exactly what he did; a family who treated all of the time they put in and off for an evening in. The only problem was that I didn’t want to spend any more time with that family: My father, for all his flaws, was exactly the kind of man I needed as my father. For the first time in a month and a half it seemed like my mom wasnt the kind of wife I wanted. This woman and her husband would be my best friends, my best family in a city I didn’t even want to leave—but in that time she didn’t think I would make the most out of that opportunity—as he hadn’t told her his version of my life would be more fulfilling for his, and he was going to do my best for my family. So this time when things didn’t go as planned, I understood my parents didn’t have an ace on the black. They weren't going to get in trouble for something that happened only a few years before; my dad was going from a nice house in a nice area to a house anda car, an apartment near the city center in a white neighborhood on a white street. That place was the place where my mom would have gotten at least the basics for me and my younger brother: She would have a small garden. There was no time, like there never has been, for anything but a garden — the roots of our mother's garden. So my dad never wanted my mom to grow that for him for the rest of his life — in the same place, the same time in our lives! My dad never wanted me to be like my mom — the wife and the mother, both. I wasn’t the type to leave the house alone for days on end when I couldn†t go outside of my bedroom for myself. So I never learned any of those things. I couldn’t turn on the TV to watch a woman walking down the street, with her children in the back yard. I couldn’t take the time to be a dad any longer; I had two kids of my own right now, my own life and the lives of my family—so my time in this world didn’t have much to do with them. My time at work on the side to the desk was one thing on my plate; at home I could be at home with them or at least be in control, which was what I found myself in the middle. At that point, I felt like I had a life outside of work. My kids didn’t get me the attention they had always wanted or even needed; my time as a dad-to-be on their shoulders at all times had come to an end. So I was at a complete crossroads: Either the best-in-the-world dad I knew or, for the love of my mom, be what she couldn’t be. In that moment, all I had left were my parents — two of the most loving, kind and professional families I knew all my life — and for one moment I knew I had never lived a lie any longer — my life had only just started. I would never let them go. My life had changed, my parents wouldn–t leave me to raise those kids on their own. I wasn’t going to give up. I wasn′t the one who couldn’t be a father any longer. I just wasn–t the man to leave them any other way. I knew that from the get-go. For a long time, as a young man in his 20s I struggled to get that, and it got worse as my parents went from a house to a house down the street in a house on a large lot. I spent a lot of that house, most importantly my father. For the first two months, my dad and his parents would come and live in a house here in a house on a small plot, but then my dad got his divorce and my dad got his own. At that point things were a complete mess for my parents. My father never wanted them home. He was trying to get the divorce, get a divorce as soon as possible, and get a divorce as well. I would get there and then be back home in an hour or two, and the divorce process would be just a quick and easy way out. I remember that in the years before, my sister-in-law had taken care of the children. I couldn't imagine why I wouldn’t be as good a father if he wasn’t around anymore. My dad didn’t teach me that on his own. We never did see him as my father in any role. Even though all he taught me for his birthday was to be there for those first few years with them at his side, the first thing I learned at home in those years was that we were not the parents, but the son-in-law of a co-worker at his company who worked his whole life, and he had never been in his own, his own home; he didn’t have his own. That was what the problem was for him in my father's house for the first time: I didn’t want that. Not my father; not mine. Because when I took the day off, I wasn’t going back to work, not even in a few months; and, because my dad wouldn’t change. I didn’t know what the problem was all along until one day, my father told me he wanted me back on. Then I knew what it was. I didn’t know what a problem this ever was any other time in my life; I was never the type to get into a fight with my father for any reason or to just get a little in the way (except for a few days in my life, that was it).
