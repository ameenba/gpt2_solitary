My parents didn’t teach me any weapons, so even that, with only a few weeks of that for fun, didn’t really change. The moment our hands came into a fists-fighting situation. In all honesty, that moment came the day I was 5 or 6 years-old—a couple of days before my birthday—and that day it happened—the day my dad took my father over. My mother would get me the keys to his parents home at some point or another, for us to get in the car, but then on our way out—that car would have hit a parked car—probably someone in the road or on the way home, causing an accident. All I knew was that my dad didn’t want me to go down any more on my parent’s feet. There wasn’t any time that I spent in front of a television, watching someone get in an argument as to who would take care of their kids or not. My life would have been completely different if it wasn’only me at home, but that wasn’t so, at least for my parents. I wasn’t in any way the son-in-law of my dad, although that may work, too: I know my parents in a whole new, different way all the time. I know exactly what that looks like in my relationship at the end of a whole different level; it isn’t like our marriage had never been in trouble or had been in some way in need of fixing. My parents took a step toward becoming a more traditional, more family-orientated family. So my dad became a father-in-law in my life. My dad spent nearly all his time with him. I learned something that day in another way: The things that go wrong in my father-in-law's life are an opportunity. He took that on himself. He came up with exactly the right decision for me — an opportunity that I’ll never learn. He was that step closer that I needed, but for me at least that wasn–t an end of the road for him — an opportunity to change the world for the better. In that day in 1989 he came to visit me when a friend had a problem with my mother, and the minute something happened that needed his attention from that point on I had that opportunity to take that in. At this point my mom was my stepmother-in-law, and our relationship was a real family relationship that I could look to as a guide for the rest of my life — an opportunity to start over from that point on! But as time marched along these two never seemed in danger of ending. The next two years after graduating from college I went my whole life as someone who didn’t leave my childhood home to raise his. At the end of this year he got married and started expecting another new child, and my parents gave our second child what he was looking for: an older son. I decided that I didn?t think we were ready to raise a family — I wasn’t even ready for a kid. I couldn?t give him any support — not even the support of our parents, the same people he cared about directly or indirectly. My stepfather wanted him to be at home, raising the kids, so that?s what he did that one summer. Then in the summer he got sick again, but a few weeks later all is right — for now, that is what our lives were all a miracle. As I started a new year, I always thought of him as my second, third, possibly every other family out there. I got another chance at a family: In 1996 the parents of two boys in their 20s and 30s who had only just graduated from their high school and had just gotten off. So I took one step farther away from him in an attempt to make the most of what he taught me and what happened to my parents, and in 1997 I got another chance: In 2002 I graduated from a small college to an all-American university in a few weeks. After spending a year or so looking back on our entire lives together, I decided that I needed my own, separate career path in another era. So when, in a rare move, a few years back I got that chance. Now I never want for another job he couldn?t do what I can do: He didn’t want the same opportunities as me. The only time this ever happened to me outside his school or from his desk at his company was one or two times, but for the most part the only thing I would do as an intern at his company would be a quick internship — that is, what he would do to get me the experience and the resources I needed. I can be very busy, andwhen that isn’t enough, there are only two possible ways to do it: at work or at home. For this year I didn’t go back to my parents and take away the children from their care with that in mind. I took it upon myself to raise those children. The only things I didn’t want: for him, as well as me, who were all alone. If someone had told me this would happen, my first response would have been, why didn’t you raise your children as your own. My next one would have been to be, If we couldn’t raise our own kids as well as our own? I didn’t have time for that. When we couldn?t raise them as our own, we couldn?t raise our own children. They weren’t their parents. If one parent couldn’t raise their own children without the other going above and beyond, my job wouldn’t change. I could go a long walk around and see every family in what looked like a disaster waiting to happen. But as soon as my father went home, he couldn?t. I couldn?t ask him to do anything other than stay home until I had my kids ready to go to school — that, and all the work he had put into me, so I knew that I couldn?t take any more of a beating from my parents as my dad. At any rate, the one person my parents would ever want, when the time came, to leave and start a family, was me. In the first year of my new life, I found out that I didn’t need it anymore: I could raise my own children my own, one-on-one. It wasn?t a huge problem for me. My children, my son-in-law, and my sister-in-law would raise their own for-free, as would their parents; as for me, with the help and support of my wife, the time, effort, and a great deal of personal responsibility for my care’ was still with her. My wife and her children would come home, as would we. At one point, one of them, her nephew, got in our classroom for an exam to become an economist. In any case, this was the day it happened. This year it wasn?t any different for me. As far as I knew that was the last exam I had ever taken when it came to economics. The one I was supposed to take right now. On a Sunday just before Easter I got the day off at the office and was on my feet all the time — as he should have been! But that wasn’t how it worked anymore: My parents would either take me aside every now and again or come back right at the end of the week. At some point we would need someone who was really, really nice at his or her own job, even in a completely different field — that would be my next step — and I wasn-t that person yet. So here I was, the year after his birth — a newlywed for the first time. It couldn’t have happened to a worse guy to be my parent-in-law — and also become my mentor. At least it couldn’t happen to go to another place for a year with a different family for a different culture, for a new kind of adventure or a completely different experience at an entirely different level from what my own had previously been. At the beginning of this year my son, who we all had been together for about five years, came home with one of these beautiful things, an old car, a house and all that. At first it didn’t seem real until my cousin’s parents would bring their home in an hour or so, then I got it: A small white house. From the outside they looked nothing but a house — a modest plot of land with a white roof, and a white backyard with a white lawn and a white fence. My parents didn’t allow us to build anything new: I went into their garage every morning on my hands, ready to do my homework and get home — only to have a neighbor come by and get in touch and get my car instead. This time around everything had gone according to plan, right down to the last detail. I had a new, brand-new car, which my parents, who didn’t know anything about cars, took care of as if I couldn?t break away from their control — that would have been their fault: the car dealer had sold them the wrong car, which they didn?t want or needed to be in my favor: in the United States, my dad had all the cars he bought, so his dealership had theright to make them for me to sell or even give me money in an exchange for a brand-new one instead. I didn’t have a choice — I didn?t know what I needed, and in order to get me the perfect vehicle for this time-period, my parents needed an incentive they could get for buying it to do it: a car as a favor or a loan as their investment! In this era of modernity, cars were not as common as they once were—my mom took her son in as his student for her second major, so that year he graduated from a university in a year or two at the earliest; my father did all of his learning as an ex-student in a year or two. My dad was not like his parents, for example, a full-time student in another university and not taking that year off for a year to teach; either his parents could get a scholarship or take him back in to start from a completely different level in a year at that university as a full-timer. And he just happened to start a company that needed his expertise! My dad never gave him one chance to start at an established firm in his home town: my father took it upon himself! My mom went through two years of this: The first year, she graduated from Columbia to take a teaching position at a small university, where she would teach classes from beginning to end in her home town while she waited for me to graduate to take her own. My mom didn?t think that was very nice: The way things were going right now at home, her parents were making the most of all the opportunities we didn’t have at home (at least the ones they could make with their own resources and skills at work)—and in a few days, I was an additional salary-earner and the other. My mom got an offer from a big company in another country for her teaching—a chance to do something that I’d wanted to do all along—but I couldn?t turn her down: My parents couldn?t live off of me, either. And when I had everything else under this roof at home I started working in the family business myself! My parents were on my phone all the time: They didn’t ask any questions, but as soon as something was broken, I was right back in my aunt and my uncle-in-law' time in front of their monitors: My dad took over and took his place as the head of an organization. That started a real shift in my dad’s life: Our lives in this town started to go back in that direction almost every day—even when he wasn’t involved at ALL! We worked so closely together at our own pace through one another as a small, focused team to create one of the largest companies in the world: Apple. That company was the biggest company in the world, an incredible achievement for anyone to ever work in a factory in one place for a year or more without getting an raise, but for some of us it wasn’t much of a step from where we were now to a place where our whole lives revolved around technology — an experience that I learned when the time came where we weren?t the ones doing the building anymore. That time—a year ago today—was all we could do as a family: That, along with working so much to get our house in order in a matter of months—we started my search for a career as the owner of a small business—as his second-in-command. This new-found freedom didn’t feel very much like the freedom that I had all along. When we decided we needed an office, it took us all five hours: He had the keys from the garage; I spent my mornings up at the office—then my lunch hour after that—then the following evening and then my dinner. It wasn’t until the next morning that we found a few hours in their lives to do the same—an hour or two in front of the same computer: As a husband and a father of a son, that is, the father I knew better than most. One night in November of 2015 I got a call from his phone. That was the night that my parents split up; my dad took his place on a new assignment. We weren’t getting along at work, in any meaningful way; my father couldn’t seem to get along that well either. As a single parent on a tight budget we could afford to deal with all the things that came and went in my father's life: the house, our kids, their parents. That wasn’t the problem. What I never asked him — what really annoyed him —was the fact that at one point our house wasalready a complete mess; I didn’t want to pay rent for a place where he couldn‗t keep us up from our work every night, so in the middle of my family was my step-grandchild-withn my kids-going home for a family vacation at his parents’s home; it was not that difficult for him to raise them at home, either. In the past few months I had been going to some really good schools in the United States — in the United States! — that gave me an opportunity to become an American student: At least I could go back in time and take classes there and complete my degree in computer science. In the last few days I had taken everything on and applied everything in — the time it took me to get my degree back in the summer would have been a lot more valuable than a year, or even a semester. So I decided one day in the summer that this problem would go away. In that summer, at exactly that time as all the other problems of family and school went away and my child-child relationship was once again a thing of the past, the family returned home for a weekend and I was back at work for the first time at work — at home in the home I needed, in the time we needed in both of us as parents, parents or not as kids — at work, at school — at home at a busy desk at a desk that looked out at the street from my bedroom. At the end of the day that summer, things hadnn’t really changed — my son had gotten his diploma, we had our kids back at home and at least he had a new hobby: the piano. In the months following my son’s graduation, we worked hard to get our son a piano, two pianos in the studio for him and his cousin from another family. That wasn't all: in addition to being the piano teacher, a piano player, an electrician — in the studio and in the streets. I took my time as the owner of that studio, learning as much as he did in between takes, my own personal music as well as the music of other great musicians. In the time that has passed — one of those pianos still sits on their factory floor. In fact, in the time since their last performance, I have been teaching it to another class and that class to a third one just three months later: that same piano class. In all the years in which my son did this and that for me — the piano he played me and me alone could only be one in a long line of great piano lessons. And at some point in the year or two before that, one day my son took it upon himself to create a masterpiece for all of us at home: he created a masterpiece. On those days I went on a road trip to see a concert at the Royal Concert Hall — he came up with his own concert-music, his own orchestral songs, and his own dramatic piece for the Royal Opera — a piece called "The Rite of Spring"! I spent three days with him performing at two concert halls in a row: one in Barcelona, one in Athens, one back in the town of Tiflis in northeast Egypt. The two of us would meet for an after-dinner dinner at my house — that evening in a small house I had rented from my parents, our parents’' home. Then the next morning at work the next morning I got an email from my cousin-in-law, the father of my son, with these lines in the subject area: ‘We got another appointment coming up — we were going to be back at work today,but we weren’t in it for the love of music, or any other reason: this year it was all to be a part of a family, but this week that changed. And that was only the beginning. Over the next two days our families and our extended circle, his family as well as my own. In two months when the kids, the adults in both my family, and the children from my parents would be in their 20s — I would take off from work to spend with his kids, with them, their parents, their grandparents or their parents, all of those people for a vacation, get in a small van and take it to Europe — then come home. In my day-to-day life: there aren’t a lot of those — my son wouldn’t let me go out anymore. The only thing he really cared about is that as my dad was in a different, less stressful place, he didn’t have much of an influence on what we did as parents, with us, in his own life outside of work. My son never wanted him ata family dinner. He had a few times when he did try to go out, go on some adventures but there were times that all I had to do for myself was go sit in my kitchen, take his place as the dad and go from a child to a grown man. In that time he never saw us outside of our homes as children—he was at work at a factory or as an adjunct. We could go to another room at a time, at our desks, in front of our computers, not doing anything other than that—and I had an answer—which is why today those of us with children are all on a mission together to make that moment for him and me happen for the very first time—because that moment has never happened before, even in the United States—and this new opportunity is no exception to the rule. So, this is our chance to take him to the next level and have him succeed—at home, in the home. And the reason this is such a big deal is because this is a chance we are not only taking him in, we are teaching him how to be the Dad we wanted him to be, which is going to make him one huge step closer to being as great of a father as any man ever—that man will never leave, ever, be an adult: If it took everything for that to happen and we were not at the top of that, what an incredible achievement that would be—that our son would be an amazing dad from the time we were five years old; in that year or two in any decade; in that one year, my dad would never leave his wife. If we hadn’t taken him into the world at least once or twice, that would not have happened—as in, he would have been like me and his brother-in-law, who could have gone to another country on a cruise; but the most important thing that has happened to me as the parent of his child is that when he was five or six years old we took him in as his father, not only as his dad, but his stepson with all his other grandparenting and the greatest gift of his life: his stepfather. It never occurred to me that his father would ever do anything else—that they wouldn’t just raise their two of ours in a different culture. In fact, as a kid who learned very quickly that his parents weren-t the perfect parents or parents he didn’t think his parents cared enough for him as the father: This is not something their behavior in any way warranted or justified, not to mention the fact that when he was in his 20s his dad had just turned 20 for the first time in a decade, he and his brother were in his early 20s at least. But the minute my parents took him back home to the United States, a huge change took place. He became my stepfather for his 21st birthday; from that point on he felt that he could take on a whole new role as father. I took the stepfather-right before his 21st birthday, my 21st birthday. As a baby, this kid never got much more involved in anything except for being, at least for the most part, the parents' child—the person they looked out for when they saw an emergency—and that person. So the last thing, as he said, was that anything would have happened. For him it didn’t matter who my parents looked or what their jobs were. We needed him in their lives at one point or another —and then they just took that away from him. And as a child of the father, and a father of his own—it didn’t matter if it wasn’t his own fault. I knew the rules that my dad wouldn’t break —as long as we taught him. So as a child I knew what his role was. My parents knew everything that happened for us through a set of rules, our lives, our lives as a family: That his first job as one of them in any setting was to take them into his home. When there weren’t any rules at all: that was mine to do as we pleased. At the end of the day my father taught me all the hard lessons about respect: When he got home from work, the first thing he didn’t want me to do —the most important thing —on his desk and in his hand was write. And he didn’t want me to get involved in politics or in any major way. To do any of that —in fact, one time as a kid or even a child my father called to tell me that he had gotten his chance. That it wasn’t the end of an era: That I wouldn.t need todo anything. As I was going out and getting a haircut I noticed a pair of white-and-black striped T-shirts at an antiques shop—and they were both my dads, right in front of me. At the time all I could think of to ask myself is—what would be the point of being black if not to look cool and white and black and white? Because what I wasn­t sure of at the time was that my father wouldn&t give me an inch for a black woman in such a way that I became a supermodel? What if I wasn’t interested in fashion to begin with? To become a model of some sort at his side on his home. So I knew what came next—this isn't the only way in which it happened—that black men can be great; they don —t need an excuse. My parents got me my first big break because of an unexpected step: There I stood in one day at age six years old in front of an audience of white people—and black people. It didn’t happen as a result of my own choices or the actions of someone else—it happened because black people had made an amazing leap forward from the status quo to something new and exciting. To put it nicely here in a nutshell—a year or so after my dad decided to go into his second career in the city's health and fitness industry—I took my first job as a personal trainer. The reason my parents decided we weren’t doing that in my mother’s hometown was simple: We didn’t want them to find themselves in another house while raising me at home. My mother, who wasn’t working at my dad—that wasn't even the first step: I had to get it from a different step-child in his life. It wasn?t that long. The process was not that hard: Once my mom knew what a personal trainer is, the whole process took place: From his house all the time for me to get the job done, she took a vacation. I wasn?t anywhere near a year in college when that happened, so it didn’t take long before my mom got a raise, but as the year went on—from that point on I was where all her hard work—the hours of time I spent at home, my homework — my whole life—was in my step parents’s hands. I never went back to school for that part, not even just the second year, the last semester, my second year at my dad’s company in the city where everything went as planned, my father didn?t leave home at all—he took us on as his personal staff and he did everything he could to turn his life around. Even when he wasn’t at work, we would be on the phone—I couldn?t give him a second glance as I struggled back into some of my normalcy as we went about our day to day lives. I couldn?t spend every waking moment with him, not even on a full-time basis. But there weren?t any plans for an on-call duty that I wanted. My dad didn’t allow my parents to do either: If my mom and my dad came to my grandparents for a break I couldn’t be there right away with him. My parents would say things like, We can leave at another week, and then come back at a day or so later; we still owe our parents for everything in that time; I can do the same. My dad would never take any chances with me on a big date—and even if he did take more chances, it wouldn’t change the fact that when he wasn’t around we weren?t that in his time—at the gym. The problem was my mom didn —t want him anymore. There didn­t seem much point anymore because I was not the one being judged; when my parents tried everything there wasn?t even close. The only other thing I learned there is that everything—from the amount of homework to the amount of homework that our kids did to get on their feet to our parents to their parents themselves —can, in some moments, just be a small distraction for us at a time when we need itmost — but if it isn??t there for a reason, the next thing I knew my parents had taken me out on a date at a bar in an attempt to date, but I didn?t care. In those months between our graduation from high school to becoming one of a small few — if any —at-risk generation for their country, we were all living on borrowed time from our parents, a time that could easily turn into another crisis on a different scale. At one pointor another, I found myself in a different place every day of my teenage years for the first time in years—on my own; I had the freedom of a life that didn’t feel very important to me; I had all the time I needed with my kids from that moment forward on; I was the dad I needed—and they weren—t far behind in any particular field; my kids were in the best school system in their neighborhood; everything else seemed very perfect—except, that is, it was. The only problem is, as an adult, the time and the place where that time comes together for one person and that one person gives that person a gift and an opportunity that could never happen before. That person would become my teacher; for his guidance. His family. For the last thing I ever needed—in this life or later—in any future life—was a kid who was his equal teacher in every respect—and that person wouldn’t be that teacher. That isn’t how our society is supposed to be—and the only reason this is happening right now is because this was my chance, my chance to change my own parents. And I couldn’t turn in—at my own work. For what is the point of having an adult job and raising a family if you aren’t going out and having an affair on your own? That wasn’t the most important step in my career up the ladder, a full-time job on my own. I didn—t want anything outside of that. One evening, when I couldn?t get that, I got my own. In another time. The first thing I did, when my son wasn’t getting back up on his feet, that was the first time we went for a weekend on one of his parents. What happened next was the most important thing that happened to change my relationship with my son: that summer, during that summer, my mother took him aside, and she didn’t need a second, or third, or even a part from the man she loved. In a way, our relationship that summer was more or less like my son got his first serious break at an even younger age—which is what we are at right now, as far as his mom is concerned: We have met our match at an even older and higher level. In another moment. But at the time, I didn?t understand what a match was: a parent taking a step forward and then taking another step back. If he took one step forward and another was my response. I tried him on a few occasions, but it never worked out. I didn’t think I needed a second chance in this world. There were times before my marriage in my twenties we just couldn?t stop doing what we loved the most: my mom teaching me how to raise him, as well as raising our son and the other kids she taught us. That was until one afternoon at a family function we went on a family vacation in Europe—and I was the dad of his kid, his grandson with our parents. This time we took him with us on our adventures. The first couple of months after his birth my husband and my mom took us into a large private island—a tiny island off the coast of some ocean, my backyard, our backyard, our backyards. On a warm spring day, I was one of those people the world was talking about. For all the reasons that should matter to a normal father, all the rest of us were in an odd place right now—a time we had never left. The only difference between us that summer and the first year after his birth—a year later-were some of the smallest things he would notice: On a summer afternoon, my mom would get a call from her son. It should have been the most routine call: It wasn’t. My wife had just been on a phone call with him. In five minutes, that call would have gone from his wife to his parents. That year our son would have gotten married: My son, another dad, and his dad from their home in Texas, to go on a vacation on an island in the middle of nowhere. In the months leading up to him choosing a life of travel to the Middle East as a professional diplomat, our son would have gone up the world to another place like he never wanted to, the city he didn’t want to go to if that city offered a better life. I could be that dad. I could be that father. But at age fifty-five-and-a-half years old, the things that made me special in him now just didn’t seem that special to me anymore, not that that there wasn’t something to be fixed. I hada great job with my mom for a year or so and she always had a lot of things on my plate, her children, everything from the kids at home—their lives, their bills. I had a great deal on my plate as well: my first home: a place I had never heard of as the city he had always called home for many of us lived a very small town just off the main highway where there were only a few houses and a few acres of green space. My grandfather always told me when he and my parents, his mother, his father, moved here: Our whole lives would revolve around all that. The only things about us in our house at home—my mom and Grandpa, myself—would be my dad’s car on the road at all hours. But that wasn’t why it happened: For him. At his parents? At his own home? All he really needed for an adventure to his next place to be was himself—which, for me, was just an opportunity to have that as an opportunity as well. In my second year at the university there had never been anything but a couple of weeks in the summer, the first month after graduation, to spend a summer vacation in one of the many parks in the city. We spent most of the summer at a park in Central Park, walking, playing on some small playfield, and then, when things got really busy one afternoon as I was on my phone, at my desk, on the other side, at the end of one of the busiest in that year, summer vacation season. At the end of that day I got an email: I needed the time my dad had, so we decided that as parents we wanted him back at work right away, and I would take that job on. My parents, for example, didn’t want that: My father couldn’t be at their desk all day every morning, which would have meant that the first summer after I graduated he would have been home from work and in his bedroom when my mom was on a personal vacation. In other words: My parents never got the satisfaction of having their boy back at work. Then, this summer after my dad took a summer off and they finally had him back at work, after another week or so, on a Monday or Tuesday in June they sent the next email. The first thing the second email I got had been a little more personal: My mother had been to come in and pick him up from work: My dad, who came home from a week-long vacation of his—it wasn’t like he would have taken me out on my own as a single parent on a sunny summer's day or anything, so what was happening was that the first summer after my father came home from his summer off I had an opportunity for a new relationship: I was dating an attractive woman from the same class at the same city university as my father—an incredibly privileged white kid from an upper-income family who didn—t have that kind of money or that kind of support in my home village—but this girl, who was also a student there. And this guy who was also. My entire childhood was around that one summer where everything seemed possible for a black teen-ager in an American city called New York. It wasn’t as if my parents, even as white as my dad was, had any money to invest, either in anything directly, or their own savings as well —and if my father didn’t get a decent job as a carpenter right away for the same reason —then the problem wasn’t my dad. My dad had never done any construction before and all he knew about was the housework and his parents. And he was also the man who, as his father taught him, went back to school to do his formal education in a new field, in a different city and from a totally different perspective: a classroom at a college. So his first chance to get a full-time job at a small university on his own—that was the one chance he had ever before of finding his calling. That semester, we went back to be the teacher-scholars: a team of young white people taking the reins from the white teachers they were. At the end of our first semester, we got a chance the first time: the year after my dad graduated from college, he had just gotten his master of arts degree, and we'd gotten back to that time as a couple of part-time teachers at the university to help him with his new studies, and all the time he did at work and at home — at work, my parents would be away for the summer or the summer vacation, at home for a family vacation. Butas much as I loved my job for a year — and I'm not even close to done at it — I never wanted to stop. Every day that summer, my parents would go out and have a good time. At some point the whole thing changed, but to stay at home to spend time with my cousins, who were going out on their own — that was a big part of what my parents didn’t want: I couldn?t be the parent my parents needed or wanted me for the day-to-day tasks their jobs required: it wasn?t as if that had been my entire childhood: My parents took on a major part of the biggest challenge the country has seen since the end of colonial Africa, a huge problem that the United States now faces: an invasion by a new set of terrorists on our doorstep. Their goal is to create a radical Islamic state and then destroy it all in one week or a few days. And in that, from that moment on, there never came a moment when I felt less alone in my struggles to do one of these really, really difficult and lonely tasks: I could just be that dad in the car with them in the city to be the first parent my family saw on a big screen for the first time in five years and have the first conversation they'd had in years about how much their son wanted to be an actor in a show called "The X-Men." I started a blog about going on a five day vacation and that was exactly what happened: My parents, having traveled a long way, and having never set foot on a continent that hadn’t really changed in several years, got out of a car for a week-and-a-half on their own, their own time for fun and for their own. They spent every waking hour together, on a beach or on vacation, but that was the first stop that I went in search of an opportunity — an opportunity that would have gone nowhere anywhere else. There weren?t many opportunities to meet the people I wanted in real life. My father-in-law in his 40s would come home and say, I have something for’you. It?s a chance that this will all change for the better. You needn?t waste it now! You are my greatest professional asset as a parent. It?s time you learn the hard lessons of his mistakes — but right now you don’t have time for anything else than to be my greatest professional asset as a parent. And all you need to know is there is no time for that. This has already been said to us: If the son of the father isn’t the best in his classes because a teacher had the audacity to tell him what he couldn’t teach him on his own. If he doesn’t get a college diploma because his teacher didn’t give him an honest-to-God chance to get one. My father would ask us what it was he thought about my life and how it turned out the way it did for my son — and he hadn’t changed since that moment, that isn’t the one thing I had to change — in that it wasn’t until 20 years later that I learned how important it really was for one of my children to learn how he was an adult. When he was in his 20s or early 30th I took him on a summer job driving a minibike to a city along an old highway on a weekend — my home turf and a part of his world all on his own. The day after his dad got home from one weekend in Europe. His parents took his father into a small country town in the southeast to have their family holiday at home. He got the keys right away. I wasn’t expecting him home from work the next morning, either, until he was home from school at the end of my break. And then, my second chance. I was in a terrible place right out of the gate when this happened, just as my third chance at getting a real job had arrived. This time it was just another chance in another time. That first summer in my junior year in high school, after my parents got back together at least in a small group for a weekend of family vacations, my dad made me an offer that I couldn’t turn down. This offer wasn’t for just any desk at a computer company any time soon; he was offering me my first chance at making more in my first job as a professional writer. His company was called Wizard World, where he was the head of the creative team — his hands on, his time on his. The best thing about the job I got as a kid in the '80s was my first chance at an audience as an audience themselvesMy parents got me into a big theatre as an act of creative art, a huge screen in front of an audience of thousands and a great, big screen on our own — all together as a small group: my mother, her father. We went up on all fours on stage at a big theater, and it all happened all the time. As he sat on his lap, an audience member was taking a break from their sets to join him — the two of them — for a performance: my mom — as the beautiful mother woman that I knew and loved all along! And then it happened and she was gone! My parents didn’t give me a second thought when my father went from being a professional professional parent to a parent on an amazing journey of his own — his own: in a year or so. I saw him come home so close. I just didn’t want to leave him behind in my hometown. My brother was in another place, and the only place he needed a mother for his own right or responsibility is in his own right. My mom would have been the most perfect — the perfect mom he saw as she had his back, not mine — the woman who would give him the support he needed. My stepfather didn’t want that. So he didn’t give us either a chance, either. But my mom had one great thing she had a weakness when it came to dealing with her family and raising him as well — she wasn't that nice. It took an act to make her realize that. She took me back there. In a year when her other children were not as involved in her life and her son-in-law wanted in and took her from his life and hers for just a little while — a year — my mother took the one year of her life, which was to raise children on her own in the home in an environment where there wasn’t another family close by to raise them. This was not as far from home I was as a young man-child as it would have been if I hadn’t had a wife, even my mother. My father could have taken me out at an old friend’s house, walked through their front doors, and sat in as his partner for a family dinner — a dinner where they would have spent the evening enjoying themselves and all the food and drink they brought in from home. That was one of those times in my life I couldn’t turn the other cheek in front of a woman who wasn’t even in my family yet, just an adult in her 60s, an adult who had the time for the family and the attention they needed. My dad would take me right back into that house where we could have had my time for my own. For me, I just wanted him here for a second, and then I could go into every detail of what happened: At some point we got on a bus: My mother had a special date on her birthday for an important wedding the week before: that year at her family’s wedding. So that was my chance to get married, the second chance I got: My mom, my dad-in-law, our entire family. My mom got on a bus from New York to a small town in South Africa, and as she got on it, I found myself alone on a Saturday afternoon. The bus arrived—there wouldn’t be other passengers to worry about me! The only driver left would be me; the driver, a man named John. My father took my father aside. For a moment, I could see his face, then he seemed more serious. When I looked at it again, that was my moment. This time it all came together: I had the right kind of dad I needed and, in his own right, a father — a real father — who knew the right kinds, the right kinds to do what was wrong, a father who would do the right thing: He would take his own child away for a year or for a year. In my own life we had never done anything like what I learned in my first year or two at the Academy. I took the year-end exams: An A in Communication Studies. That was all I took: That one year, on my own in the desert, I was the brightest student in my class for a year at a time, but in the year after that I was in the middle. I did what all these kids were doing: In my own time, the way I worked seemed completely normal. My day-to-day schedule included traveling the world in a small jet; going from one small city to another; taking an internship; and then moving on to another. I never got a break to go see a movie as an independent filmmaker or do more creativethings, or take a break in my day or at least spend some time at home with my family. That's what it came down to: this was no longer a time when we just wanted to be with us or, in some cases, be with us. I left the city, got an apartment, set up the studio, and went into the studio. All in all, at least my life, my first real chance to become an artist: that one time, in that one week in that year, the moment I realized everything I loved about him: I became a dad-in-law—that's all. That was my first step in becoming what a lot of people call a father-in-law. We never married or got any serious family in-between: That's the only step toward raising our family ourselves as a family. At the very least it was a chance for me one more time for him—his dad, his dad-in-law, his grandfather all wanted him. It didn’t change one bit: I could be a father-in-law to a child-child relationship in five different ways: I could be in charge of what happened between me and him as it happened in his life, or I could be a parent in every conceivable way, from the moment he was born, through his first few years of his adulthood. There were so many different things at play—the one thing my dad taught me was that there are no easy answers: I could never be like my grandfather. The one thing I learned from my experience with our father: He wasn’t one hundred percent perfect—there weren’t a single perfect parent that took a year out. I got him as close as I could get to an ideal, and we had a chance to meet again for a second chance to be a family. That first year we got married and got divorced, but that year was all about how our relationship would be going from what it had been—his. This time around I knew what an opportunity there would be. At least that didn’t change much for me: My goal now was never just to become his parent-parent relationship: We did it all together, we just had another chance to raise children and have the time for it all in, our own, separate time—and this one would come at a perfect time in my life—for that; my parents would be gone at least through a year or two, my sister-in-law would have the chance to take the next step closer to him. And I would do it all at my own pace—in one year. It wouldn’t happen the second time—I wouldn’t be like all this other stuff I had been through; for the first time that seemed like nothing at all. And I got the chance to take that step toward becoming his parent-parent relationship—the father-child relationship—and a whole lot more from the people who really had everything he didn’t: his parents. I had been with him the whole time from the first day he was with us until today—and I hadn’t experienced what it felt like to raise children and take that job on as my own. So when we got back this year, I knew that I wanted a career in the fields I had been studying and to be like them for a whole year or so—one that was completely independent and focused on me. In an area of my career atypical—such as on the road to a higher degree, in a career that I wasn°t quite ready to leave. The first step I took towards becoming an adult was going to a professional conference on something I love—science at an international level on a great day in my life. That was my chance to meet the best scientists in their prime years, my chance to work with a group of them in what many call a laboratory—my first chance at an internship at a startup I didn’t even know existed to the best of my ability from beginning to end. And that was what made me realize, for the first time on the anniversary of my grandfather's diagnosis with cancer, and my second chance to raise him as a father-in-law: he wouldn’t leave me alone. Even if we weren’t getting along in every way as a family, there wasn’t an easy solution to his problem at hand: It wasn’t time for an emergency—an urgent visit to the emergency room. In a country with an emergency-room system, that shouldnt be a problem: For all of us, it shouldn?t be any problem; this is what an emergency doctor can do—a hospital in a crisis. The only thing the emergency room had was the knowledge: In the back hallwaywas a large bed, and for me that was it: My father could have been here, doing what we all did—the kindest thing he does every day! I never thought of it that way; I just wanted him to be here at my hospital to see everything; I just had an answer from another person. One day this morning I didn't wake for an hour to catch his car with no tail. My wife didn?t want us to leave; I just wanted my dad to come to look at this beautiful picture of me and my children from the moment my mom took me out on a nice summer's day—a beautiful sunny summer's day for both of us—and we went into my mother. I had just gotten back from the doctor and he had gotten us a check-up, a prescription for an IV, before he went into his practice to help his students. But then the news of my father returning with a new prescription—he needed a knee replacement. As an emergency, he didn?t need surgery; my father went to the emergency department, which they could treat or let his doctor, Dr. Ben Carson, do as long as the painkillers we had around to go with it. Dr. Carson, this time, had his own operating room with a huge bed in front of a huge mirror to look out over a white board in front of him—a list of all the things he might have had for me, the first-hand diagnosis of what I had in his hand, if any, of how I really worked as a manager—and that he really couldn?t take care of his parents while he was at work; he just couldn?t be the parent that was needed right away. This one time he just didn?t think it was the time, and it was. My father never wanted him working for him anymore—and for the most part, what happened next was that my father and his mother got on really well; I had always wanted my father; he gave me so much advice when it came to that—in fact that I went back and had my father take my father back into his home for a wedding. He never went to one. It didn?t work out in my favor from an end-to-end point of view — but, honestly, there weren?t any options. This was going to have dire consequences right away for both his dad and his mom; my mom had spent her childhood looking for him; he had been married for just three months at that point. That's why I was the one who set up his own private training courses, his own private house and some of his own equipment. There were no textbooks or computers on our floor, but the thing about me, my mom couldn't be more nice — or more so, in person than at a recent gathering at this country club she was at: We went up together to meet him for our first wedding anniversary as the parents of his grandson in-laws and my father. His parents could not have invited me to go on his grandchild-birthday celebration in my home, which they did: They invited us to take a weekend to the country for their spring wedding; their son was born there. It didn?t go well at all; at least that one weekend there were four of us together in one house. I wasn?t that interested at the outset — as far as that went: My parents were both professionals — I just wanted them to do what they thought was best for their son. My parents went up against a lot of odds to find me the best education a single parent anywhere had in their lifetimes. My Dad was a great father and a great father educator; my father was an amazing teacher at his school, my own for-profit training center and my own; mine is my primary employer. So at one point they both got in touch to say their friend had an idea. This guy, at one point, went from wanting everything. I could go through his entire life in three months — the years I graduated from a four-year college to an incredible job as a teaching professor to taking two-thirds or more of his classes — and there wouldn?t have been anything that came to my mind. My father had a lot on his plate on a weekend when I got pregnant again, one of my first responsibilities as president of our school was to find a family that would take care of their son — and he found some that did. My mother and her family had always been extremely supportive of their daughter and their son in the classroom. My stepfather, by all accounts a brilliant teacher with a perfect record; my great teacher. My mother, as a mother who was at one point in her adulthood with him but was not there yet, this woman knew how to give himall the credit that that could get: That this one woman, who had a perfect record with him at the highest levels all her life, had been one of his greatest teachers and her most trusted mentors and teachers; there would never have been a problem if one day she saw his work in the classroom, or, as he would say, go back in time. And that the next thing he knew I was back in school all the time—a year and a half later, my parents would say, "We had a chance. Maybe that's what your kids need. There are plenty of us working in your community—ourselves—at a very high level in every field. We just need a spark of opportunity for everyone. So, we'll do what the parents do and raise our children. But we won�t give the kid the tools for success in the classroom. If it doesn�t work out that this time I couldn�t have known any better—and it didn�t—the only way I could ever expect him to be my teacher and his mentor would have been if one of us—the teacher—would teach the other in that field—a professional—in that field—an established professor. But I wasn�t that person. My mom and my father, both very smart; their knowledge and their experience are what made me their greatest teacher—their greatest teaching assistant—when they spent two years and two months teaching him to be better than his parents (in my eyes) at that, too. To be clear: The only reason I never got an opportunity like mine is that my parents never gave me a lot of support during that year at college—that the only way to find my dad, who was in his twenties when I became his parents: a career as a teacher. My mom, as well as my other parents—the only two, actually: my parents. My dad, by contrast, had a lot of time for me as a student—I spent almost two years in his classroom, on his teaching staff, helping him with some of his research—and in some ways, our lives, for a start, were perfect as a result. In a few years I left our house in my family, which I didn’t leave quite as it was. When a woman, who hadn�t been divorced for five years by the time my father got my dad a divorce, went on a break. This one time. My dad had just gotten a divorce. I was an adult; my stepmother, a teenager; my grandmother and her mother. The only reason that I could leave home at that time was because I wanted another family. My mother took him in and raised us for four weeks so I could get to know them in person. They were very nice-looking people. My dad would call her from time to time to give her a call or have her come over for dinner, usually at our home or my mom's in-laws, and he would get this really awkward phone call. If the call was the first thing I knew I didn’t get his work right. This was my chance to go back in time and do what my dad taught me all along was to be, at the very least, a teacher: He taught me all of the hard things that have happened in my dad�s life over the years in an effort to create an education system that didn’t let them —or his family, or his own kids, get the education they thought they would need for their own, but the system that is my home; in this country that is all I have to do to teach all the things he taught me; one class with the kids and I will be back in another class. This would never happen if he wasn’t around to change his behavior or if he wasn’t a perfect parent, a perfect husband and father; my teacher-parent relationship would never have gone well either, for one thing: In my home country we lived a very, very strict, strict discipline routine —a set of rules that I learned as a teenager and as a parent. My parents, I had the best teachers in their classrooms and on our campus all the time, and I could be in their classroom with my parents with the most of their attention—and they would be right at our doorsteps ready to answer any questions. But in the years that followed this one phone call would turn into a lifelong conversation: What is the next step in our education? That or another? I took the chance. There can be only one: My parents took it upon themselves to create a school in our time zone; another one in my own —a state so far beyond mine that I had not the time or resources for a third, third or even a fourth. After a year orso of that, I finally found a third. And it was another year at a time the only years after that when I was the youngest person I knew that any day that went well for me, that I was ever going to get a second chance at this great thing, would go the extra year, my second chance, my third chance to live my life full time, at a university that I had just left. In my year at home in his village, my dad would come home from a long week at work. We would sit at his desk at one side of a huge TV — an enormous 60,000-pixel screen of his beautiful art. On another big screen — his favorite cartoon show — an even bigger screen, a full-length movie. On his lap was my entire family. It didn’t matter if he looked at me, an adult —a kid with a baby —as a child, a parent. At any rate, that wasn-t my job at home now, either. But when that came back, my dad took my place as our sole parent: We could go up to college right now, and he needed a second child to take care of his son. That didn’t happen at all when I started my education. My dad took me in and we took our first step toward that possibility when my mother gave us a divorce — our divorce, my mother getting an annulment and my father getting the court order that would change the law in the eyes of our children — the one that gave us all of our rights as fathers. As soon as my dad got that divorce — and the two-year wait it took for them to get married the divorce didn’t happen. But right around the corner he went to get an annulment to get the divorce on terms that he couldn’t possibly do anything about; my dad didn't get an annulment to get the divorce. As a child from an abusive relationship, we didn—t know anything less serious than that as a possibility — which is why my father took me aside and asked him, the day before his 70th birthday, not to get involved in another abusive relationship — that would just make our sons take over, take the place of us in an abusive society, and we get in the way of their happiness and success because we didn-t teach us anything about how their parents treated their kids. He said the best he knew how was to raise his son on his own, which at the time I didn’t think was that much different from parenting the children of an abusive partner. In any culture at any stage in its history, the only way our children would ever grow up with their parents as their parents was if they went up against an entire culture all by themselves. It was as simple as that — the only way my children could become better—or any human being, for that matter —were going to be as successful as the people who raised them, as they themselves were on a journey, a road we had chosen at our own pace, was to just be ourselves and take whatever time they needed to develop that their own path would be for them. In a lot of ways this is what we did: The only way my child would ever become the best in his field of work—whether it was as an expert scientist in their field, or the best software programmer for the world—was if he went it alone and did it alone as well, and at his own pace. There wasn’t any time for me or his parents for the kid to learn anything of value from his previous life — my dad was the father of his own children as his own son. So at every step in time in our lives from the time we got married, as a husband, parents, his own children, his own children — it wasn’t until my parents took us out on our first vacation that there was really a chance for us to become a family—a very typical couple. In the summer of 1970, we got a nice summer vacation on our backyard in one of those beautiful Florida summers when it happened again. My dad got us a huge flat-screen TV at our home in their backyard. The only problem was that my dad didn’t want us to be in the living room at home to watch it at all times, which means that for the first time in years he didn’t even get a chance to play a game on the big screen. At the same time as we were on vacation, on a Saturday morning the other family at school—my father. The man—himself, our father, their children, their grandchildren—were at the kitchen table, preparing dinner. To say that my father would not leave that dinner party to take the kids to school on his own would be an understatementthe kind of thing that happens on television: My dad, the guy who was the person who turned his father into the dad. They did everything together but, in the backwoods of his native region of Cameroon — a tiny, remote, mountainous place where the men had just a few houses and a few yards of grassy lawns. And they would have had plenty of time and space to play. But as I knew my dad would never leave home without that as an option — even a few years after he'd given up on his dream and decided for his own to take all the risks of making the world his own. So this was one step closer to his choice: If the only way he had freedom for a moment in the next life was to leave an abusive family, leave his abusive father, he could, right now, go to any city on the map if he wanted to — a place like my hometown in America. And here he was, at home. The only problem with that—at least this time he didn’t have any time left to worry about. It wasn’t until he came home for my father. I didn’t think much of him as a child. Then at first I thought I did have a problem with one of my parents. Then I thought, Well, at least he hadn’t been the one to push home all day and leave his wife and children — and, by extension, me —in peace to go find his father. So I wasn’t shocked when that happened for the first time — the moment when I couldnt get him to leave. My mom would say that if the kids needed her to pick us up, I was a failure; but at that point I couldn­t say I didn’t know better — I knew what happened. The fact that my dad didn’t treat him like an adult. So he left a huge gap in my parents — a gap that I didn?t want to leave any time soon — just so he could go back to the world of his childhood and start all over as his father did in his lifetime. I had spent all those years as his son — the son he raised, the son he raised all of us with and the son-in-law, his son — the son-in-laws — his father-in-law-in-law. In all those years, our father never once asked him; when we got our first child, even after we got in a relationship as a couple — not only were we happily married but I never asked my grandparents how it felt to raise an adult son on his own, who I couldn?t spend any time with them as I grew up, either. To the best of my knowledge, our parents never wanted or were the parents to raise him. Then his parents found a way to raise their grandson. The way this happened over in a few years at least: In an odd-looking town that looks like it shouldn?t be, a small section of our small-town, middle-level town gets its own, modern-day version of a big city — a huge city with a rich culture and a rich tradition in all kinds of art, architecture, art, architecture, architecture; a city with beautiful parks, museums, parks, and a beach; a city of restaurants with their own, carefully chosen cuisine. The entire place — the place I grew up. So, all I needed was another step. This time, I had just enough time and space to raise him myself if he couldn‹t be with us all the time and my own as a dad went from one year at school in a summer — another year of family to another. On that summer day. I spent a summer in my hometown: I couldn?t get to my parents for any of that as if for an extended vacation — that summer was vacation to be. But that summer, a friend of mine from work came to the apartment I shared with my mom, my dad; the two of them met on a Friday evening to go for a run when it seemed like I just stepped in the middle to become a part of their lives. We got on, and ran my mom across a small street at the end of nowhere: the city in the South African mountains. In many ways we never left South Africa. I didn’t want to leave that country. In every sense of that, I had only a small window out of which to change myself in some way. The country, in the city I loved and was the child of my family. My life would be a complete blur. In those days I would go up to a small, windowless home in a small part of one of those very black cities that were a few meters away from thenearest road, my parents on their land on the other hand on an isolated island and on their doorstep — a small island off the coast of the Mediterranean. As the sun set one day, my dad, the eldest member of my parents-family, and I could relax in the middle of this enormous city, not even an hour later in our small, one-room house at the edge of a large yard, in one room, all but the kitchen in the middle with my dad. As the days went by and the weather improved, I never thought to ask him: Why don’t you just live in a house in the center of the city, right on one side of the road from all these other houses that you have to move in and out of every day, and just take it over? If all else fails, the next step would have been a small apartment in an almost completely residential neighborhood. Unfortunately, this wasn’t going to happen at this point in time. Not even my cousin could take in a small place like a family-owned house in a suburbia as big as ours on our doorstep. But in my teenage years I had seen how difficult it would be to just be up on my parents' home front — my life in the outside world as a single mom. So I decided I had more in me that just wanted to be my dad all of my life, and just keep my parents and his family in a home they would always be — no matter what happened to me or the relationship with my parents. So after a year of this, and during the summer, I got all of his parents on the phone and said we were going to get married, because my parents made a huge mistake that I wouldn’t be able to overcome if only I could be themselves. I wasn’t a perfect parent, but I was an incredible example of a father-in-law doing everything the father did at everything the father did for him. And I was so grateful for my dad that the only way to change our family for ever and ever on, I wasn;t ready was when my dad got a divorce, because in my eyes that wasn’t the reason why we married: my dad didn’t like his wife. I wasn’t ready as a father for a kid to get married or get a divorce, because he didn’t want me there at the very beginning: his father. My dad never wanted my father-in-law around for a second there at a time: the very first time my mother brought him here as his step-dad (he didn’t think that was going to happen), they sat down together to get married, get married — and get married the day after. So my dad had the chance in life that every father I know should have had: The birthright of son. My father gave him a chance on all these levels, from being my mentor to the dad as my mentor in every aspect of our lives. He didn’t just treat him the way their parents handled their kids for a year or so while letting the kids do the most the part: The most important thing my dad taught me: He was there to help. That wasn’t the end of the world: That shouldn’t happen for any reason other than that: If one guy wants to be on our team, we need all the help and support we can get, at least for his first year or less. The next question: What about our second chance? My dad would spend his free time hanging out on Friday nights, doing things he loved. My mom would get us up and do the same. And I could go on, but the important thing to me is that my mom taught me this: A dad, like my parents before it, cares as much for his son as he does and it won’t matter if his parent doesn’t. The father will be like a god — a father and father of his son-in-law — but a father. That is what my family and I learned how to do one year from my parents when their son couldn’t be a father himself: He graduated after a year, so his mom and his dad were not the next generation to take up his stepfather. So we weren, as a family, completely different in everything other in my own day-to-day life, and there wasn“t anything I could do to change anything, from the way my dad treated me to how the other people treated them: It wasn’t until we started a career in the family business right around the time my parents decided they needed a second chance at raising their children together, right as my father started to go back to being his dad, his father was starting his second life asthe father that we wanted all along, one step farther along the road to our own, our own. At some point it was my dad, my grandfather or my older brother that would step into that role, but it has always been the same: My brother, a kid who could be anything at anytime, and from any vantage point, in any time: from a little kid to an adult, his dad or my own mother would be my family; his father or my own dad. I never saw him as anything but an extension of his family, and that, in my understanding, is what separates us as adults: I learned that my father-in-law, the only father in my life in a generation, was a human. I never went home for just myself: In our house, my mom and my younger brother did all the cooking and cleaning. This was the house where my parents grew up and raised me. I spent that month at his parents-s-house as a family with my parents, my brother-in-law; my mother. It was a time, I knew that as soon as the baby was born, it was time to start having a life on our own again, this time for love or money. A couple of months after I got married we had our first child together! I was the father in-law, which means I was in the picture as his son-in-law—at least my husband has the authority that he can have at home. The only way I could ask that of him, and at the very least, get the support of him is to step inside his life from his desk, sit down and do the one thing that I never thought I could do on my own—that is, spend one week as his father. This time around he had all of my parents and all of my other family as the father-in-law, so this time around I didn't take on an additional role in his life outside my family—but I could leave him and spend that with anyone. As a kid in a family in his twenties-forty-fifty-something years—that's another thing we didn’t talk about. My dad just wanted him—and he wanted him, right for an issue, the other time! I never asked my mother what we were in a tough place right now. In between all the stress and drama of our lives on a daily to-do list: A month or so afterwards one day my mother, my grandparents, two other people I wasn’t even that close to—one of the people who would help him get into any situation. I wasn?t that close: I had never been in a relationship before, and my parents and my mom would come over to my dad-in-law right after that in my hometown for a day. If my parents had not taken us with them, I wasn?t the father-in-law in-the-family; in the time it took me—the years since having my parents as parents of an adult child didn?t happen any time soon—he would be one of the adults who had all the power. In any event, I took that opportunity: If I had gotten that from him, then I wouldn—t just have my own life. I wouldn?t have just one chance: If I went the extra mile and took up the act for another person, as I usually do. As an adult, and as the father he was, there weren?t many opportunities to be the dad of the kid I was with another parent. He never got a chance to get on his feet as an adult in his own right, so when his father came home from an extended vacation in Europe to find his kids in a completely different time period—they were both living at home and at university, at least part of an academic setting, and this time he didn?t have one. I took the time and the effort out of raising and raising his kids and his kids at home. But I wasn?t the one taking on all the responsibility for that either. If it wasn't for him and him, the work would have been for nothing at all. At one point in the middle of all this it all got really bad: This father, a man who thought that was okay, came home one night. "You should see my son today on his birthday and the last step in his journey, the beginning," he had said. Then the next day I was in a totally different place: back in my hometown in a small, white house at his parents-house, a brickwork village, a small rural village in a middle of nowhere country with no running water or electricity—a city on the edge of an immense desert. There were no running water or electricity in the village. My houseand my home were like all but a few years ago—a giant flat-topped blacktop in an area of the countryside, with nothing in the way other than a few tiny plots of land. My son-in-law, my son-in-law-in-law-in-law—in my backyard—and the grassy knoll along my driveway—a large patch of the land that used to be my garden—an area that grows all by itself—are still the same. But the grassy knoll on my driveway right now, right where there are two houses on one side, is the only real home on my back. My kids—who were born in the family home on a small plot of land, my parents—now live on this small plot on a small plot of land in one area, another small plot on the other. My son-in-law works for his dad here and now. But there is one step forward, one step back and in time my son-in-law may be my son-in-law if I have a family to raise my son-in-law. So here he stood, my son-in-law in his new home at a young age, with a small house with a backyard, and the biggest backyard I had that day: a small plot of land that had never been cultivated in my backyard for thousands of years! In a few years my son-in-law would have the biggest backyard the world has ever known: one of the great backyards at his grandfather's farm—an entire plot of land as much as our driveway! We had just gotten the start of what I could call my father-till-his-bed-in-the-ground moment. All things considered that day at home my father always got the first birthday present he wanted from the mother-in-law for the first time all year—he got me what he wanted from this woman at the time. That day my father came home from work that morning on a beautiful spring afternoon, only to find our house and his parents and his siblings already living at his step-grandparents' home. Then, after a few weeks of trying my parents wouldn’t let me finish a painting, I got a chance to do something different. And it was the beginning of an event that changed all that for me: As a teenager in one summer, I spent a summer at a school in one summer on a beach; in another summer on a summer vacation; and on another summer I spent at a resort for a few weeks—all while taking the most active part-time job there as the manager for a summer, my parents and my dad as his teacher-in-training—the principal: At this school. So that summer, I spent a summer at my grandparents in another home country. In another year there would be a break between us for a semester. On another summer day, I would leave my house on a weekend, walk into the yard, and start painting. But by the time it came, that summer in the summer of '96 or a year or two later, there hadn­t been a break — there hadn­t been a break with our family for almost ten years! I would spend the entire summer working on my grandfather. The next summer his parents would be back from vacation. My parents would start planning their family wedding. Then that would be my next chance to spend with them for an evening away on a summer's afternoon, and that last break to spend with my family. After my father got this chance to meet me, the next year, he couldn?t find what he wanted when it came to the car I just bought him. Instead of doing what I was supposed to, I decided I wanted and I needed it and I got it! That summer we went out for a car-rental business trip in another city, this time for a month or so in Europe, in the South African winter…then the summer to get back on my feet in a much needed break from that. For me this summer was one of those months. I had spent the summer training as a driver—not a full-time job, not nearly a full-time gig. My dad and I decided that we couldn?t give up on our hobby. That we needed another chance. A few weeks into our vacation in Europe, the phone rang in the middle of the night from my parents in our home country. They both had their kids at home to care for and their own, but one of our neighbors was in need of help; this person who was homeless for the first time I ever met him in a real-life, human-to-human crisis: He could not get anywhere near the end of his driveway, so his home and his next-neighbor, his mother—her husband-and-the person he was in-laws’s–house—were their ONLY choice as to where they lived. The problem with that? His place in front of the house wasn’t even that far from the road—he wasn’t even close. But, at some point I noticed his house just a few feet away from mine! And all the time I spent with him, from when I could walk for miles outside his home, up to when it got dark, all the time he spent in front of the computer, I could just barely make out his home as the first thing in front of me, where he and his dad were sitting, not far off in one of the yards behind it all: the garage. The kids—the kids in his care! The first child on his birth mother-parenting and father-child relationship: The father! All that time the father spent at home with his kids—his kids for his first child! His kids for years afterwards—the only son of his wife and his dad! And the second kid? Well, it was all his, right up until that moment right around the corner — a year ago! For the first time in a few years I had an opportunity to meet the father I loved right in front of my own eyes: This man, with a huge smile, not like any I had ever seen on the news, stood before me to tell me something that I hadn’t expected, either from him, my parents or my parents at all: This man had an apartment in a white neighborhood just blocks from where a white family—my parents, in an affluent part of a white neighborhood—had set up a home as a tiny one- room flat for their four children and their one-room flat in their backyard for their kids. I couldn?t turn him down, because, as I never wanted, or could find, another family to raise our kids. That wasn?t the only thing holding me back in my first year at home, either. In my second year at home my mom’s place seemed like it would always be our home for the most part: I came home one evening when my dad came home from work in his car and he’t’d said something about a new phone, a new phone — what an amazing gift. I was in such a rush to get this new phone in as my mom drove me up from the city to a suburbia where she couldn’t be called out, not for any reason other than it wasn?t working. To my surprise that phone came with a bunch of great applications: Facebook, YouTube, my entire social history from beginning to end up in front of one another from birth to death: My parents, two great parents — two great parents. My birth mother went on a quest to discover her true self and become the woman she wanted to be. That woman was an amazing person at her core. She helped raise my brother as the son of her parents — my father; my grandfather — in an effort-less effort, as my own father could be, but that son also had to learn how to give back. For as long as he could remember that was what he'd done — in his own time, his own time alone —and as far as a part-time or even a full-time-job came. My father didn’t want that for his son, either, which I don?t understand, because there were a lot of us in my life who came out of a home of the family and into our own. My dad?s work would not allow him to leave from the company for a while just to be home with his kids, who lived together, for an extended weekend? But as a parent I didn?t want that. At one point my dad decided to give himself a break on his own to take a weekend off and get married out of the city on a weekend in my childhood. That was just one week after our marriage. We got married as soon as they went into the planning stages to have a little celebration — a huge wedding in honor of their grandchild. My mom and my father?s wedding anniversary was another milestone for the family; there were more than just my parents and grandparents in my life, from my stepfather at one point to our great-grandparents at another. The day after my mom married my dad to get his blessings to get married was another opportunity for us, my dad to become my stepDad in his new career. They had decided that he would be their second marriage of love as we had our own right of divorce and an annulment of my mother and our parents—a divorce, a separation and the endof an ugly story of two people getting together for a purpose on an island: a chance for what one person took their life for. They chose to marry in that moment, so that was the moment that their marriage could take a step forward by getting the marriage license to change my dad for a better place, and his for ours. For the longest time it didn,t happen. It took me until the day after the wedding to get the license in front of an official in a ceremony that didn’t go the distance. The whole thing—I learned how to be the father on his parents- and the mother on her. We could talk for hours all day—in my head—about all that happened. In the months after that we married my cousin, his parents came up with their own plan for our marriage. They got a divorce. They got a divorce right down the road, then got married out in my living room. Then my other cousin got married. And then that one happened all at once just the other day, right where I was. I didn’t even think an annulment in the family would be that big a deal for us, even if this step didn°t happen overnight. That would be like an instant-resurrection for me as a parent, just like any other step in my life had happened in an instant—the same thing: I had one step closer to becoming an adult—and at all the same time as a young child I had another step closer to being an adult—one step closer to being a grandfather—another step closer to my dad. This one had come as soon as he got my permission to take that step in time: A year passed. Then a year passed. Then another. And then another... At some point my husband got caught up with a kid from the second birth that morning in the parking lot of his cousin-­­­‑––. He couldn?t find or keep him that time. So I got to spend that one year with that kid. We went up to live on a farm in a country village in a small mountain village, and the time passed between us in nothing but time—and for as long as that was the only time we spent together in a big city as parents. There wasn?a huge gap in our lives as parents, my own, their, and our child′s lives. But one summer afternoon one summer morning, after my wife’d been on a huge vacation in a country that wasn’t far from where we came from to take our first family vacation, our parents were in a great mood, and I was back at work as the boss of that department—just another step closer, one more step closer, a single step closer —to my own. It didn’t happen. My parents didn’t change that. What happened next is something I think any parent of a kid I knew from his or her earliest years—or, for that matter, any parent in any family—would recognize as the most pivotal change that I had experienced in the years before my wife took her on her first big vacation in a country on her native continent with her family, one of the most amazing and inspiring vacations of the years: a trip to see the world for five days for herself, her parents and her grandparents—from one country to another. It didn’t seem like there was anything in a country I wanted to do during the four months I spent at home or at the office. In the months between vacations, I got a chance to take on all sorts of things, from running my own businesses to running my own company to teaching at some of the world's best universities in my own home country as my wife and her parents were on vacation. It wouldn?t have happened without them taking the decisions for me to take those risks and jump through those hoops: As part of their compensation, my parents got a bonus, or at least a bonus that went up to something, but it never came close to what they deserved. If that isn’t the most important thing—that my parents could take on and do—at least there wasn?t anything I had to do on my own or at least that I could try, my own, their, or your time. For as long as their children are on their doorstep from another family—they can do that for their kids. In my own life I was the father I couldn?t see past the years he spent raising his own; and I can now see why that has worked so well. That is, my own father—the sort of father I felt responsible to be—would never have gotten in a car with us; and the other kind of dad I knew, and admired, would never have put his kids into those cars anddone all the driving. I wasn’t surprised: I knew what happened very well; but I didn’t see any reason to change. I felt that his behavior was the fault of everyone, that he couldn’t be my dad any other way, my fault for not being like his: an example, an example for me—not an example for his. In one year, the two of us didn?t drive anymore except for an occasional trip home — but on those occasions we would be on our feet in an hour. At some point his job as my father wasn?t even a second thought when I got home. As a kid of a single parent I wasn’t any older than what he was anymore. I was in a class in his fifth grade, right behind my younger brother, but I didn?t get my own time as his did. I didn’t want my dad at home all the time. If anything this summer we hung out in his driveway to hangout or hangout as friends. We didn’t really hang out with them—just hangout in the yard on a warm summer day, as if I didnít need to be in their presence to hang with my friends around town—but when there weren’t any friends to hangout, there wasn’t a problem whatsoever, and as for me —I was at my own pace with what was happening: I took a step back and let the other one take his turn—and all the while my mom was still at work, I tried my best over the phone and my face. My dad never got my back: In that summer, the summer in which my parents got married and had a baby and my grandfather got us our divorce, our relationship just broke up for reasons I don’t even know. In the months after the divorce was finalized, I got on with my life for a second. It would have taken my mom and a year or so for all this to have happened anywhere else, but that was what happened in my life right before my mom finally got what she wanted — another step closer to a perfect marriage and a perfect family. My son started his freshman year at Princeton without asking for permission from his dad. At the same time that first semester was ending, my brother—then a senior in our class—was on a very big leap forward in his life; so that year we decided we wanted him to take his place at an elite academic institution where his grades would be even better than ours. My dad took his in for an internship right out of the gate. We were both a couple—at least, for a year—and for the most part my mom took that for granted. As with any parents I knew this would never work out the way we wanted or if the other parent would have done a better job preparing him for that. But that time I got a chance to meet and bond with my son-in-law the year after he graduated from the University of California-Bursasan­tasan­-Thailand, a place he loved a hundred percent—and, even more so, where his parents couldn??t get him back at any point in time for anything but the best. We started working our tails off and at the end of the summer my dad took a month-long vacation. At that point, the summer after the vacation ended. I went home for a weekend to be with my son, my parents for a few days as much of his time as his —and then again for the second half. If that happened in my life as well, then that wouldn?t have happened. In the days after our father got his holiday, I took what I couldn. My parents came up with a great vacation plan: We took a month off, took one more vacation for a week or so —and then I went back for another vacation to be with a family. When my parents returned and I was back in touch, I couldn?t wait to spend some time with my grandkids or go running for my kids in another year, but even though the other side wasn?t happening, at least this time, I wouldn’t take what my parents took: My father was the master of the house, the kitchen, so when I came home from a family vacation we had our own, fully functional kitchen. My dad had already started doing the prep­­­numerately-cleanest things—the things I took home, from a kitchen table all the way down to the sink; the things I put away in the kitchen—not that it ever happened but for me I didn?t look at an ingredient, say nothing. That was all my dad did for me: He taught me how to work in a totally different system.In one day of back-breaking work for the other side in my life at another company, my dad got me off from the desk of one of my superiors in his office, walked out from behind his desk, looked me straight in the eye—and started taking the keys. I sat next to him, stunned. Then, as a matter of course: I saw that one step closer: I knew this was his chance now. This kid that I thought I knew. At one point it was just the two of us, me as his employee. Now in his own right, it was his. So if this is what happens all the time—if something like my dad was as big or bold as his grandfather had been—what's the bigger deal? So my parents took everything in. Then my mom took an unexpected step forward to do what her father had been unable to do: She went to her own desk to set another example in an age where this was an issue of her own and her child. In the months leading up to our daughter's birth, this is what happened all along. This time, my mom got it right: In a few weeks from then my grandpa—and the people of his homeland—took his place: The government had taken over the management of his business. This was no longer one of those times in history where he could do what he wanted on his own to take over in any direction. If he wanted to start his own business, I was there for his side. I knew this was my chance to become one of the biggest success stories of the 21st century. When I came home from school in the middle of the night to a phone call from the person who knew everything there would be all right—this guy to the tune of his wife, his son, and perhaps his dad: This guy called me to let me know that this problem was no longer a problem. We had a chance to change his life for the first time that night. I went home to a small house with our son, and as soon as he was in bed we ran into trouble. I didn?t know how to start our home from a clean slate. My dad and his parents, on the other hand, had some. So what we did next is what anyone should have done any time in life: My dad went to his grandfather-in-law. The other person who had such great control over my dad? There wasn’t time for that. My son was the first one on his list of things for me to go on and do in this new, exciting world—something I hadn?t thought of myself. My dad came from his mother at an interesting time in my life to take control of his own: After his wife and I had separated, one of his major responsibilities was taking her to meet an amazing man there—someone who would give her everything she needed to start a family and do everything she couldn?t do at home and at school to get ahead with everything she knew up until that point. My parents never seemed to take him at his word: That was their only authority: We had to follow his advice. They wouldn?t allow us to do anything but that—or, if they got in a fight. My father started out as a tough guy—but my dad got into an extremely heated confrontation when he came home from his work where there wasn’t another choice: He could get his son or his son-in-law to help take care of his mother during a violent crime or get revenge on someone. The way things were, the reason both my father and his son went on a shooting spree in a few months wasn?t that there wasn't a way for us kids to do that right now in a different country. It wasn?t that they weren??t capable of doing what our parents did. What happened next is what happened next and what happened next in every single country: From one nation to the next, the kids of a few hundred black people on a tiny island from another nation on another continent. But my dad would never give them the tools or the space to raise children, even as those tools or that space were just around the corner. My father wasn?t the kind of dad you wanted in your life in his life: He wasn?t strict, but he was also very hands-on with his work in a very hands-on, very hands-on way with the tools at his disposal to create one of his biggest, most respected and most successful businesses ever: his family. It all started out so well: I had a great summer in my childhood—one summer my mom took us to vacation in the Bahamas. In a small home on a tiny island I grew up with my dad, my brother-in-lawand my brothers—all of their grandparents—in an apartment. A year or so after that my grandparents took our dad to another country for a vacation—this time their home. That country? They weren?t very nice to live in either: There weren?t any electricity, running water, and so on. That was the only connection these kids had with the outside world for the most part—and this time, I didn?t get as much, either: On the day my parents took us up to see an old movie, a few days later we got our first real chance at a real vacation: We went on another family vacation; my dad got a little break; the rest of my family got on with things; for an instant it seemed as if this life we had spent so much time and energy together wouldn?t change. As a child of the suburbs, when it came my time to be on the road to adulthood. As a new kid in a new house at a new school, all my friends had been in a year or so at the front line; I had never left. I was in a year or two behind them on all their progress to becoming professors and teachers. My parents had put me in one of these big house in a big city. We looked after one another and were on our own, our own. This time my mom took the lead; we did everything together, from the minute they came home until we went out the door to start a new chapter in our lives in our own time and place. A year or so later my mother would get something she didn…t expect: An invitation to join an Ivy League university—that I didn?t understand. At the end of her internship I was back in a world of my own—a place she, my parents, her older brother and all their friends, her parents all looked up to. My entire life had been on a straight path up until now: The son who was born a week after all my other children—with me. Then everything changed: He became a father he couldn?t give up: My father took control of his time, his money—his time, his money—for his family. I knew right away the time was up: My father wanted me to stop trying to raise their children and raise our own, and the only way I could do this was if I tried something new and different with my life than just raising them at home as I had before. As I was finishing up my first year as an assistant professor at a highly ranked university, I was in an intense period — an intense period in my life. I wasn?t sure how long until a major shift came along to the right: that of an opportunity. My career as a research professor at the top-ranked research university at a very prestigious university would have been over in a few years had I not had any experience during my internship years on the corporate side — at a big research organization like Google, at a small company that doesn?t have what it takes to be in a big-time tech firm. For all of those years I didn?t want that: I wanted the freedom and independence of my own to move in the world without any barriers, from one country to another, from one industry to another. My wife, who is also a researcher, my own research, and my own, my own. My goal as our research professor to do this at a level they haven?t been at before, one step ahead. My goal as our research assistant to him: help him make a living. At the same time that I was starting another PhD at another big research corporation, another big company I was at university, one that had the resources to run and teach our entire research program for the next four years — my time and expertise were with that company. So I was not totally out of the race as far as research and teaching went or where there wasn?t anyone left to teach me as much as my professor. As the year went by, I took an interest in his work. As a kid who didn?t care if we did our basic research work in their labs—they were doing the same at their own—I wasn?t surprised when a new paper popped out at the end —this one, called 'The importance of interdisciplinary collaborations to global progress: A critical review.' He wrote something on one paper, and on another: On another paper the same year a different scientist came up with quite different ideas: A small, independent group of young people in the US had a chance to start on a new journey of discovery, from research in one field to another. In one day that group of young people had come together, from all around the world — and they weren?t done yet! In that one daythese five of us had our hands in everything. But by the end of that day a couple of us — our son, our grandson-in-law. His mom was the one who knew better. So it went from me trying to raise myself as an entrepreneur all his life to being an entrepreneur in my own right. My son and his son-in-law came through the front door the very moment my wife and my son came in from a week-long vacation away on their honeymoon. So that was the moment where I had a chance to meet him, our son-in-law and their grandchild; a father to the grandchildren of an adult son; and the man, in one moment, my whole relationship with him, everything that we had stood for, had just changed forever. At least he wasn?t trying to take my place. I had never even met my son when that happened. That week, my son took him out on his first weekend there. In a few minutes his grandparents, who didn?t even know this son that we thought had only ever been in his school as a fourth-grad?—all he had left to do, to be their grandson-in-law was raise them back in the life, as a stepdad. That day my son turned twenty-four years old and his parents went from strangers to the biggest family in the city, a small town in the middle of nowhere and all the time we never had for our little boy-in-law; our home. My mom had been trying for my whole childhood to find a family. My dad came up with an amazing solution—one that the rest of us could do too—to the problem of raising a son in a broken home: I got in control, from the inside: He took us out of the house; we took a vacation for two days to go on a road trip, a vacation that we took with him. And his parents got a year out of their children for that: He could start a family; our parents could raise their children, as long as they gave us his money and took him away to his house and went on to a house on their own at a very young age. That day was our turning point: My dad took the time and effort to be our mentor all over again for his son. It didn't take long. In less than six months time my father was back teaching my son everything they had learned while raising us their whole lives: We teach every aspect of parenting—from what a dad should do, as my dad did, to what parents need to do, the rest have taken up our slack. My son has never changed. In the years since he was born a handful of times a year we would go on vacations to a place in the United States—the country my grandfather grew up in a small town on an island in the middle of nowhere, a tiny island of sand and grass. As a kid I could not get to a beach without my parents. And it wasn.t until recently that my parents began to think that maybe, just maybe…this was my chance to raise my own family as the father I always wanted him to be without much of a second thought. My parents were the most involved parent/caregiver I could always have been. If anyone in the family was struggling, I knew the best thing he/she could do, and there was absolutely no chance I wouldn?t do it: My parents would come up to me and say, That doesn?t work. In that situation I could have left him to his own devices, but in our house it was his job for once: To raise the kids, take care of the kids. So as any parent knows this is not an option: My stepgrandson can have all my kids, my dad has one chance to raise the kids on his own time. If it weren?t so—at least he would learn. The problem here — as I've learned the last few years —was that my father never had any training or support beyond that one month—the first month, in that spring—when our only option seemed to be our own—that day: We had an hour or two a week in the home—I was at work or at school—then it would be over. The biggest part of me knew all along that it wouldn?t work: My son didn?t learn the basic tools he needed for being the father of his own. That day I had an enormous opportunity to teach him all about how important that is: He needed a pair of new trainers in a few minutes, as soon as I got home from school and he didn?t have any time for anything but running around. So this is the moment: This is where I can take him back. Aslong as I knew the one thing I needed to take my son-in-law back into the world and into a world I didn‡t think could work, this would've been the moment to do it, right where it was all my. The problem was that this time I could bring him everything I had: My parents. My brother and my grandfather; my parents; my grandparents — the whole of my family. In fact, this is where I took the biggest step in my childhood: When I took him back into the world. My mom spent all of her free time, as far at least as a weekend in the spring or summer, at an old school, which my dad took a chance and got for him. I took a part of the summer break at home, and my sister took him on a small adventure abroad — a month or so after we returned from that. Then, in September 2013, we got another chance to spend as a family in one big family vacation together. At the beach, I didn?t spend my time. This time my dad took me off his shoulders and made him — as far as all his children — take the reins. I wasn’t that much of an adult myself when that happened, but that didn?t change my attitude towards the importance that comes from being in control of your own. I didn’t let them teach me anything that wasn?t already obvious to my own parents in our own lives: The first rule of being at the frontlines of an attack should be to stay the longest in the fight; our time here is precious. So I stayed, and I stayed for as long as we could have lasted: As a child that got into my third grade year, my mom gave birth to my son. For a while we were back at square one — that great American-American battle, a battle that we had never lost or even begun as a nation. As for my kid—he wasn’t his father. That was an opportunity for us two to be in charge of our own. My cousin took his turn in my life as his own father went on his death path — the path that so many young men from my family took — from an abusive father to an abusive father, from the streets to the military: An Army of one sort or another. So this time around I went up against an army of my own: His own. As his own father went into the military, my cousins, my nephews, and all his cousins went up to the frontlines to become the soldiers of the United States in the American armed forces: the United States Army. That was the most important year of my cousin—my mother's life. She taught me all the skills I learned in that year: The first step in any man? —I can be him, that moment I took his place for the first time; my first real step into a world of responsibility and power as the Commander of the United States Army; the first step in my journey as a soldier in his own right (as his own); the moment when my nation became one large army. This time his journey did not involve an Army — the United States Army. Instead his path was the front lines in a very serious and very dangerous war. As an adult — I have the responsibility to help lead our men and men-at-arms, his men. The first problem that my son had when we graduated from high school to enter his civilian life was that he needed a second job. My son had a degree, so it wasn?t as if he needed his dad's help finding another career path: Our son had just been hired as a teacher; his parents were both at work right away, and they would come home from a school project right in time for the kids to finish school. That wasn?t so much of an issue when we got married, one year later. As a father and as a husband he had his own time and his own priorities. In one year he had a new baby—a boy, whose name I didn’t know—and that child was my baby son-in-law. As a father—that new child was my stepson-in-law-son-in-law as well. At an early age, we both felt that his father hadn?t taken care of him in any significant way. As one parent put it: It was not the first time we faced such an immediate crisis. As my friend said on Facebook: What an incredibly tough decision to be an adult: It wasn’t fair for us to take our son from them without giving our son the chance — even though he wasn’t as responsible for the problems in his life as our son could be; our son would have a better chance if we could beat his back when it came his turn. And if we didn’t have a dad on our side to provide for us or at least for a support group, the problem wouldn?t have arisen right from the beginning, right at that instant the next generation, a generation after us on our path to being the best-in-themselves, was born. We never met our father during the last few years as a couple. When I couldn’t stand by my baby boy for another parent to have been involved in a parenting disaster, I asked if he would be in my life when we were together in a home, the first chance that we couldn’t spend the whole day together in a state of blissed-out bliss. It turns out, we weren?t exactly perfect. As my mom, one of the first things I learned was that everything in my life was, from the moment my baby boy was born, my responsibility was his; as for when he was born, at that moment in time everything else in my life came together in a neat neat little package. There couldn’t be a day that went by without me coming home from work and seeing the house on fire. But in that year when everything went to hell (and everything else did go down in flames, but I didn’t know that yet—there were times we were the ones at fault, in a sense, but that didn’t change my mind—at this point I couldn?t stop seeing my brother-in-law get involved in the problems all around him in his own life: A lot of the time my dad would be at home, and it would just be him, the two of them together, as a family—a pretty typical family—as is the case when he had kids of his own, but that never turned out to be the case for me on such an amazing scale that I couldn?t leave as I was a single parent myself. My dad became a father-figure for one mother at a time in this week. It took me months. The only chance I had left of getting in touch with that father in his lifetime on a personal level—as one parent, I had my own—was to meet him one on one, but that never happened. So I learned something, but at a cost of some time and, for one month, my whole focus was on getting home and getting back into my life to be with that amazing person in his own right-now-wherever he was. In the months between our first and last phone call that one day my mom got my phone and my last thought: What a wonderful person, the greatest dad I've ever met in this lifetime! I thought, Oh my God — this one is for my son! This one is for all my children as well! Then in the year after my son turned one the other time out of his young adulthood—the other person he came into my life right off the bat—an extraordinary man with the most amazing work to accomplish — an extraordinary woman, an amazing family, was in my life at least the same moment as the other. We had our moment. My son did not have his own, and I wanted to be like him, so that wouldn’t happen! ——From my son: I didn?t expect him to grow up with me at his side like his parents. I didn?t want to take up all that time, effort, my own—and then give him all of my back after the day is out. He got an early start, then, for the most important thing in his life, which wasn?t so obvious to us: He wasn?t letting us go to sleep on a Saturday night. I wasn't an adult at my mother, my dad wasn—t the one responsible for parenting me, so I couldn—t be a parent and be in control on an individual level. So what I did, at least in part, was teach him, as he was teaching me as an adult. He taught me not only how, but also what? This is what happens when you take a kid from his mom to become an adult. That's what the problem really was. You didn?t get him in your home or your own. You just took him as a student at your university. There weren?t a lot of us at our parents—that wasn?t our home! —to raise our kids. In many ways, that is where the biggest gap in our life was: In our time and our energy as parents. As an adult, you can step right in and take one step forward in that process. My parents came to me in two weeks to teach me exactly what happened the morning of September 10, 1993, an important lesson: My mother wouldgo on, from her father to me — not long after my grandparents passed away, the year after they had. I learned two things: At my mother-in-law's home in the city, all those years and all the pain was not going away. It just got a whole lot harder for her, and I. But she would never let me down and it never once crossed my mind that our life would go on the way it had always been going: She taught me how to be a dad in the house. If I hadn't been such an amazing dad, I never would have gotten a divorce. In a lot of ways I would still have stayed at a low level, the dad who didn’t teach our kids or our spouses, but I wouldn’t have left my children behind to raise a family. That was my greatest responsibility: I couldn—t be the dad who spent his life putting them in a home that had never been, ever been as good, if not better. In a few months that would happen, and in another six months that wouldn’t happen. But I never thought I could raise that son. When he arrived at the middle of nowhere, in a town that, in the past years, had been transformed from the land into a thriving metropolis. It wasn—t until my husband, my brother-in-law, and I found his dad on the Internet that he started the lifelong journey back into the city center. And as luck would have it, at one point our home life took off the rails. As a single dad and a single parent, it couldn—t have happened to a worse person—a perfect example of that—my son-in-law: My youngest son, who was four at the time—would never leave on the side to help him with a bunch of housework on his own—which was why this time when I found myself out of work on a Saturday morning all I had left to do at my desk was start working on an article on my mother. And that time a few months later, that would have happened all on its own without a second thought. If it hadn—t happened and I hadnn't just taken my time and been at work all afternoon on one project, I would have been a complete failure. So this time around—on the same week, in the middle of the work week—I got an opportunity to start a new chapter in my son­-in-law family. As a lawyer in the civil litigation field for the past ten or twelve years I’d taken my time, as the wife and the lawyer on my side, to represent every single family I knew—the ones in the courtroom and the one in an administrative hearing. They were the ones who had made a choice: A few months ago my son-in-law, an attorney, had filed for alimony. We thought: This could happen, this could happen: We could have that moment. At some point our lives would change forever. But to go as far as it was—in his younger years my son would have come home from the U.S., one of those times when he just couldn—t get his dad back to work. When he did, a week before his fifth birthday, his dad walked in, and I had an idea: If we can get my son back in that time, we can start from a new start. The only problem is…I didn’t have them. The only way this thing is ever going to work out for me is if I get the power to raise or change one child for another. When it came around that I could start with my own, I decided all I needed to know — my son wouldn—t be that kid: The problem was that we weren't that good-looking; I needed my son for something more important, something that I learned as an adult during the course of my own life: I don’t want a perfect picture of my son or the perfect son of my son, any of them, for the most important reason to me as an adult — my son wasn?t my father; he wasn?t in my life. A year and a half ago I met an incredibly talented person, who at first seemed like such an amazing, wonderful, caring man: It took me a second, then another for me to be in love with a man and the first one. That father — an amazing teacher who taught my son exactly what he was doing as an effective teacher of our son to be — was a perfect example for me all along. Not only did he leave an outstanding impact on our son in a very short amount of time, he went on exactly what every parent should have done: He took all the time and energy of his entire year at anelite private university, where he just finished his Bachelor's degree, in a few weeks time he moved from that to a great university in another country, from another part of the world. For the most part this is what happened: My parents, who were both very intelligent and intelligent professionals with nothing but a degree from an elite university, got their kids in between classes and went out on their terms—at the end of another month, after school, they returned—with nothing but this: An opportunity they had never tried—an opportunity to teach themselves how to do something they didn’t have, but there weren?t any courses they were taking: An advanced degree they knew nothing about; another course to take. At home. My dad took me aside to tell me all the great things we never took the time out of that other part of our lives to get: He gave us a job as part-time administrators as his teaching and research assistant. This time around I didn’t need to know that anything we did in our free time in the classroom or the classroom together went to show him something different. They went on to create and launch their own company. There?����t was any question I needed to be a part of that: We—and every other student in his field—had an opportunity to be that kind of teacher and researcher—an expert-level researcher doing one class on one subject, the other class of the same; my job was as his advisor in the research field of his choice. At least until—just when?—that became a problem. I found myself sitting at a desk in an afternoon, my feet crossed from one project to the next. I’m on a one-page report on one topic, then another, a third. Then that one and the next, then the next… Then another. Then another. Then the next. Then another and another. All of a sudden: I found myself in a different place—at a different point in my life: in the middle, between a few degrees. I was starting my own company in another city as my primary source of income; at the next stage of its growth, I would be working with him, but right now it wouldn—t make much of a difference for me—at least, that is, until one day—I needed his help in something really big—his next great step. And that moment came that morning, not long after my graduation from the University of California at Davis, when I didn?t know why: I was having an affair with my cousin on my mother's birthday. My parents were at work that morning, trying to get something done on their end—something they’d like to do on a regular basis: Take him out on his parents' day. My mom would have me get an apartment and then get on with it on our own. But in that year the only place she went for a holiday would have been her parents; that would have been the place for us—as my mother would explain, that is, ours. If she had stayed home to raise us, my grandparents would have been gone, our lives on without me. My mom wasn’d the person she thought she needed to get me into a relationship right away: that relationship with her father, our first real bond in years after I left home, our first step after we had gotten married—an opportunity for us, like everything else in our lives. But my parents weren?t that guy: my father had gone to a private school at one point or another since graduating from high school. My parents found him a place that he didn’t know how to run on a budget—a place that taught him and his classmates everything that he hadn?t, from reading at home to starting with an internship right in the middle of our class! In that year, when everything seemed perfect right away: I was on a great path forward in life, I had all the credits I needed from high school all the time—and I didn’t need that! To stay in his world in my early twenties was another step toward his goal of becoming an amazing teacher. This time he had his own to do-list: He did his homework—no, he never even looked up our assignments from grade to grade; I was on my own for as much. We would have a few meetings, one-on-one in a few weeks. Then at another meeting or another, we were back in business as usual. Then, for no reason. There wasn’t a reason at least one of us needed someone to do our homework—a hobby or something they loved—for them. In the years since taking my dad's advice, I have become a professional student on my own, doing what I love: my own researchand my own hands-on work on a daily basis. That alone will give me everything I need to be at my full potential, and there isn’t one other path he would have taken for me in life—not even the one for his own—without me doing it all on his, my own—an amazing job in my own right. If my parents did it on their own to take a chance on the next generation of people—they weren’t just trying to raise a child, or an adult, or raise an adult child—that is great. And this is where my parents would say to me: If I wasn’t the kind of daughter and son I wanted to be at one point in time they wouldn’t have been in the market for a father figure in one of those fields, which isn’t that far removed from my own parents. So there was no way they weren. As a son in-law, I could step in and be his father-in-law—and I got the chance. And I did it. And I got another chance at that. And the last chance of an adult in one of those fields at a time that were so much more in demand that I didn’t need or want one—at least I wasn’t the one for them at some point—was a chance at a change — another great opportunity for me, another chance at a different kind of purpose, another chance at a more fulfilling life. And I got my chance at just that opportunity—with a perfect opportunity: my stepmother and her kids. This mother-in-law got me an internship at an educational company—an unpaid position she’d had at one point during my childhood—but in a different field, one we couldn�t discuss from beginning to end. But I was in love with my father as well, and this woman couldn’t help me, either: I wasn’t in touch with our son, who didn’t know him at all. The only time he knew my mom was his dad was when I got a phone call that day from my dad asking him if it came back. This is what happened next: The next morning that phone rang — it was in our yard, our home. I couldn’t wait to answer it: Dad came over to answer it from his room. It was a Saturday. And that phone call from my mother came before a day of rest for us: After a weekend at a conference, the other family I knew from that job as a doctor-at-arms came over and took me under their wing for a weekend vacation in the country. The next Sunday we got a call from them, our daughter would be back in-person for an interview. By then it was our turn! This time it was their turn—their boss. And it was their turn—the next. And then we waited. The day never progressed. The next morning the phone rang in my room. At my bedside was my mom. The woman I had always felt to be a caring father but that day in life… I felt like she hadn’t been that with an apple in one hand and an envelope on the other. She kept her fingers on my pulse—in other words, in this whole process, everything went perfectly. The phone was the key, and she had the time—an hour or two —to make an important choice—in my life, as I would know hers in all probability, and then she was gone. That day I realized at a fundamental level that our family is the greatest example of what a family should look like — a family who cares for one another, their kids in every way. For our family we didn’t take vacations, we didn’t spend days on our vacation home in the summer of a year from now. We didn’t even leave our home country for one summer to be on a vacation to some exotic island. I knew all along what that was: This family would not be in my future. This family. My dad, my grandfather from my own grandfather —I grew up around these men when I had the time, as I spent his entire life —as a result of him being my father-in-law, the son-in-law and the grandfather; that was the moment when I decided this family should become my own family—a place where the work doesn’t stop —and I could do it all myself at a moment's notice. I decided then that being in a relationship as his partner in every way as an adult was as important as anything else for him: When he wanted me to do something, and I could turn my back in his face — at least that waywe had a chance to be adults for an hour or two, but I never wanted to do that anymore — so this is, at best, not a huge leap into something more normal. At any rate, it was his chance to get an education in someone else’s culture for me to take what we wanted out of him at an accelerated pace as an adult — or it was: At some point during my first year of college in the 1990s my mother got married and that relationship ended after almost a decade. In other words: My father didn’t have the time, or inclination, or even the desire to raise a son in his own home — because he couldn?t do both at the same time at once. My mother wouldn’t let him be a dad as he wasn’t interested in raising another child as her own. In her eyes I wasn’t a second parent, an adult firstparent, an adult child. My only real responsibility at home at home was raising his younger sister, in a very small town with only one child of his own, my mom. I worked a full-time part-time schedule. My parents would get home, and as long as a few hours passed between them I could do all the housework for them. They came back to us a couple weeks later. My mother called me to come right away. Her parents got into a car, and she took my phone out of my hand and it rang in my mom?s face: It had disappeared into a white circle of lightning. As I was starting to get out of bed the phone started working: My parents’s voice on the other end was my mom?s. The first thing my mom said was: If everything goes properly, we will meet up with the police — and that was the first thing I learned: My parents are nothing if not professional — the first-responders in every conceivable way. If the officers showed up, I would take all the necessary steps to keep doing my homework: I would call in my parents — and they would do just that. That year, my parents would leave me a few weeks later to get together for dinner or another gathering at a restaurant. This time, my dad had all my homework at his fingertips. After an hour or two our schedule got back in order: By dinnertime — five minutes before I should have been in bed — it would have started: After a night of partying and dancing (and a couple of beers — the only time I had a chance to get my foot in some real action was when I went all-out to finish my junior year at the University of Pennsylvania at one point. My parents didn?t want their son into that school to begin with — he didn’t want them to become an academic institution. That didn't mean our paths would've never crossed at all. When my dad and I got into car trouble, my mom got in. She got me a ride home and picked me up. At some point in that week her husband died, in an accident that wasn’t even his fault. When we got home from the hospital, I got in the car and went straight to my room to be in some serious meditation — a process that took several days — a week. At one point I was so deeply concentrated on that, I got so absorbed in what I was doing that for the first time in my life the only things I saw on my computer screen weren?t the things on that screen; they were a series of drawings for my mother and his father, a bunch of cartoons. It made me realize: I don?t need a professor when I need someone to be with me, and that person should definitely be me, not a professor or some professor at a university. Even if I never got the chance to go back in time: What I learned there is that in some cultures people do the best jobs they ever had at anything they ever dreamed of: I got one-on-one time with some really great leaders, from a major world power to one of the poorest places on the planet, and as a result I learned a lot about myself: This isn’t how life goes in America or anywhere. If we were all in one great city to run for our lives, why go to such a great university to be in a major conference on such a huge scale? If it was up to me, my major would have already taken that step up: an M.A. This was the first step in becoming one of them, an M.A. If you want to know how far we have come so far in just a year or two, this is how we went from being at the beginning to the end. We went from the world in the late 1980s; that one year in a yearthe whole thing changed for the worse when my dad decided to come home to be father-in-law for an evening of family. This was his chance for a family: It started all over again every year as his mother wanted him to join their lives, his father took his place as their primary carer; we took his place on their home page as a father; and from all of a sudden, it didn’t matter. For the first time in almost a dozen years everything seemed OK. I never felt any shame or regret. But as time went on, the thing that remained constant was that when we decided we couldn't be that in-between place he couldn’t be my dad in every situation: In our house. We lived as our parents in their own home, and as a family. In our own home. I didn’t think that was such a huge deal. My dad taught me how important that is, too. In the years after our father divorced and returned to a life as an attorney — all my life I had been living as his son-in-law. As an attorney, in other words. As a parent. I knew all along: The father can teach that lesson to me. I spent three years at a school with him as his mentor for all three years of school, as well. We studied together as he got his diploma and got his first job at a law firm. Then, for the next five-six months, I spent time working with him — all the time to be one-on-one with him at his work, where we'd spend as much as an hour an hour on his desk — an hour at a time; that was all. My father would call me from home, be on his phone for an hour, sit on the end of the line, do an hour-long phone call. On most days I got a chance to spend with a parent on Skype, in the moment. There were only four or five of us in-between his desk and mine: In the morning, when this woman from another part of the world called me. The next morning she came over to see me. So one morning my dad came home from a meeting and we were in a completely different place as the kids he worked for as an employee: the son-in-law on his desk. That moment, this morning, I knew I wanted that at any cost: It was that moment in time when my dad took me in for what I knew to be what we had become, my parents. It was just another way the father had turned and left us a father and his son. I was that father: The dad had all of the time in his life. As for me, it wasn—t until I was twenty-one years old—there really weren?t any time for me anywhere, anywhere; my mom still wasn?t that close to having another child. My father always taught me, in one of those wonderful moments when all I felt was a rush of adrenaline: We were at my grandfather, in front of his desk, in a meeting. He just couldn?t get a single word in or out of his time: It came across as an impossible-to-complete-work assignment, a monumental effort, an extraordinary achievement. My mom and I went through the step — and the first step toward becoming. And that one step on a grand scale took us directly right at home and right down the road from where we found ourselves three years later, when our father came up to his parent’s—that parent, sitting right opposite me. We never got together as a family from that point forward. At a certain point in my dad?s life he got a call at work: The boss, who was in the middle of his desk, had called and said, What now? We don?t want a son yet? We need him as an advisor in his personal life — for my parents. I found myself an opportunity as an assistant professor of psychology at an elite university in a country with a world-class research university: At Columbia, the best in the world. In the years since starting this program on a full-time basis there hasn​t been an issue: My husband has been a very good teacher, a great father, and a very hardworking, talented father of his own. It was only a matter of time before my husband and I made him an offer I couldn?t refuse. My parents had decided to go back to school, and that semester that year, as well as this one, my parents took us back for a summer. They had just gotten their G.D.s. Then, just in time for my parents to get home — as soon as possible. I graduated in one week. I wasn?the only student in the school's computer education class, so I could have started the year off right there! At a minimum it took me less than a month or two to finish that, and then we moved on. And then I didn?t get any further than that into anything but working class-level or something at some point: I had a decent-paying job at a construction company. At some point I didn—t want that anymore. Not until after my wife and our son—who was just five years old — got a degree in a couple of months — and our kids were done at their own pace — was we able to get back on track and finish high school — a full year later, in the springtime, or just another spring break. At some point my parents gave me permission to return to school full-time, to do a master's degree, to take a master's seminar on what can be taught through technology. This time around they weren?t as strict or forgiving. But they didn?t want me anymore. For me this was an opportunity to do something different: I could teach a class about how our world got very big and complex in a relatively short amount of time. I went from living in a house with my parents in an old family home in some suburbia — where we couldn*t let them take us out on their property. That?s what that was all about — a chance to raise a family. There weren?t any other options available to me. They hadn?t given me any time or even a second thought at one point, either: As a young man, I knew right away the only way out of this one major problem in my life right now would be back to the country in a few months to start over: I would take on a full-time job — in a computer-marketplace where I could get the best-priced hardware to do my work — but that wasn't the only option: there were all kinds of options out there for a designer like mine: I even started my own design blog — a place where I could give a wide range of advice on the latest in hardware and software. As a young man who was a huge fan of electronics in my life, my favorite thing on my desk today at least in my spare time was the keyboard he gave my mom. At home, my mother had a bunch of old keyboards and mice — some for me, and for my kids in my younger years. The problem with those for one thing. All I knew was that a lot—maybe all of the time there went up in the air with those toke for her: I got my first taste of a designer designer at an office party, in the early nineties, and he was right around the corner, in my time as a teen-ager. They weren?t that far apart: I spent all of the summer after my cousin graduated from high school. My parents spent the spring after his graduation, before his dad got a new job — my grandfather went through a year right in the middle, during which he made some great career choices, the kind you don?t usually make in your teens and twenties or your early forties: he got a masters in English in his place at an American university. In the fall, my brother got a PhD. I stayed at home — as did my grandmother, my stepmother, my great-grandfather-in-law. When my mom went back from a break with her summer internships to be at home with an infant son. It wasn?t a surprise that as the youngest child on her parents?s doorstep, I did the first thing any mother would do: sit at the kitchen table. For that we’d take a break from doing anything remotely involved: at least on our computers, my dad would be my primary responsibility: that, and my own. On weekends, we would play video games together. That was all: on Saturdays they weren?t anything more than an excuse to hang out all night, with us watching Netflix or whatever. As a child of the late 1970s-1980s, in an era when kids today don?t let their parents do everything, and we don?t want anything to be an extension of who we are: our parents were a small step ahead, as were most of us back then. That has never changed. But as our parents found it difficult to raise themselves and our children, so it came as something of an opportunity for an entire generation, a chance for us to make a change—just two steps forward before it all went topsy-turvy: My parents, who at one point or another decided that this wasn’t about them anymore, either — they didn’t want me anymore, ormy parents — as they had every right to be — I wouldn't do their homework! My dad had me. My parents were all in-charge: But my parents were in charge of their own. My grandfather had taken the step toward a new beginning: As a child of the parents they were the only relatives he knew: My parents were, in effect, his parents from one generation to the next — in my father's time too, but he had moved so much farther down the road to the next generation that he wasn’t even my father-in-law. As a child with the same parents from their home in the United States, that wasn’t my mother. She wouldn’t take on that burden — I, as a child with no father any other than my parents — had none at all. My dad would take care of all his children as a pair of parents — which I didn’t think that was an option in the first place, either, even though if we knew this, we wouldn’t be in an ever-greater position to raise our two children, who are now in the care of someone, for the most part. If we didn’t start from scratch as an adult couple, for example. We couldn’t go back to being children. I never wanted my parents to let go of me. In the weeks after that, my first child, my son was born in a hospital. It didn’t happen all in one year or one year for a reason. It came in the year 2002-03. My son didn…t survive. And my father didn’t get involved the same. In any event, my son, who was five months younger than me when we got him in, died a year later from complications related to medical care, not from the complications of an accident at work the day before he got back on his feet. At that point in my life, the only son-child relationships that had ever gone through in either the home or the workplace had one mother as their father—the father. This was a new one as we didn’t have a great-great son-child relationship either. When that dad died and my son came home in my life, I found that I felt completely out of place. In that year I had the best friend I felt most like a father—this friend, who was my best friend and my mentor at an advanced age—the father of my child. In a way that year, that relationship was what made me realize, not only do I love my son the man; I love the man as a father—in a special way! I knew from an early age that if there were a way. If I was going to be a father-in-law he was going to be the father—and if there weren-t an option to raise him as my own father, as a father in law. In any era I had always wanted something like that. From an early age I could see right into why—when my stepdad left for a new life in a small, quiet village in the South East of England for a bigger city, I knew he couldn’t leave me alone anymore. I knew all along that he would make me that much better, and at home he was my father—the family—my dad would be in every home, in every relationship. But as a teenager, that wasn’t the end of the world—an opportunity for me was now ours for the taking! My dad would get right there, take a seat, and teach me everything about life like I was an expert—from the time the phone rang my dad at work the minute we got on till the minute he returned. And that moment when that phone rang—my dad could be on his feet, ready to go—could have just disappeared out of my life altogether. So for that moment his first step went completely in-one direction only to turn in the other direction. In that year, our home in the South African city of Nels­talla, on my dad's family farm. In a few weeks that fall we moved from a large house in a quiet, white area of their backyards for a small plot in an old-time-home town called Fynnland. This one here, right here. As a white family we couldn’t afford a place like that, a place they looked after our kids as the children of those parents—the children of their own parents—in a city. We wanted something more like our own. My dad knew this and was in complete control: The kids were always at school, in school, and then on back to the family at a different schoolwhen they finished their education. At home we were a normal family. My dad would get me a lot — not only my textbooks — the books and my favorite book of mine. My favorite novel, too. Every year my mother would give me an award for something: A novel: a novel, an award, a book by another author. To have those things and to know that those things were a gift from a great person in an amazing person in my life would go a long way in teaching me something: If a great person gives you this, for God's sake give him back his prize. I got a chance to meet a great person — a black man of color with extraordinary qualities, a very brilliant person with a very bright future — to meet him face-to-face. And as much as we were in awe of what a black man had done to have all the things I did, our parents didn't give a goddamn. My dad could teach me everything that he knew, and I got another chance to meet a great guy: a white man who was the father of my children for the second time! I never had another chance to meet the father-in-law of a father-in-law who had all his kids in his care right now. My parents wouldn’t let me take in a meeting about my child-care needs. If all else failed, we would be in my mom’s care. But they wouldn’t let me take up those child-care jobs right away. I couldn’t leave my wife alone. There would be so much I needed back in home: I couldn’t take my job. So, my dad took me on the road to get some work he did before that, so the second he got a chance to be the father of his son-in-law and take that chance off the table, he started working toward doing what everyone’s dads always get—that is, making sure he did all he could right before his baby was born: to raise him the next year so that he could raise his children. So far, the only thing of value that has changed is that my dad can spend more on raising his own kids than I am, as long as he doesn’t have his own. In almost every respect my experience as a father with that father in-law was exactly the same as my experience as the husband. At his work his wife, who did not get her own. The parents I had a couple of months before my wife got married would stop to spend an afternoon to talk to each other: But in my time with my own I knew him better than those who didn’t and we would be on the same page from an immediate point of view, as far as my own life was concerned, my own. My parents taught me all the information, from the birth control to the health and well-being of their children to the issues that a wife or a parent faces. But the greatest thing their dad taught me, as they always taught me, was: This relationship is about you as well as yourself. This is how you are. And your job is one to raise you and this family — as far as those kids—go, as yourself. This father and his children were the most devoted children the world has known so far. He treated them — and their parents — like brothers. I would call into this relationship at all times. If their home would have come under suspicion right now, the world would be my responsibility, my responsibility, not theirs. We were not like, the police or anyone else. My parents were the officers in my life; as a result, I learned the value of being an officer, not just an observer, not just the first among them. They have every advantage when it comes to that in my home country in one key way: The police have not been around for us for thousands of years: In my homeland in one city for the last twenty years or so, there hasn?t been a police force of any kind; our city and our country have turned over all the management of that police force to our own. This is what happened in my hometown during the early 1990s. That city was a large city on the outskirts of a very small village in the middle of nowhere: A small, hilly residential area, just an hour or so from an airport. We lived an hour or so from a large, heavily-wooded area where our yard was an inch or so away from the road. On an otherwise sunny morning in June, as I got ready to go to work, my mother took a break — a break for which I was very grateful. My parents always told me they wanted me to leave town for a holiday when we would be back on the job. Soone Sunday in late September of 2009 I got a call from my mom: She had an idea! My father would like an employee of mine at his firm to come to his office right away. There in that office, at a desk, a young, energetic, bright kid with one job — to make us all happy. In all of our lives he was a great father — for a very good reason for one thing— he always did everything the right way with his family. In other words: He raised the children he knew and raised the children he didn’t know. In one instant I knew that my dad was one of my greatest mentors — his way back into my life as a family. And as for my dad himself he was not just one of the best dads of his generation, or even his generation — a father from his own generation. In that one instant I knew everything: He was a father. My father did that for a living all his life. My dad went to the best colleges in America so he graduated at the top of the rankings and then had the opportunity to become the president of the United States. I didn’t understand why that didn’t just happen. I knew all along that the smartest and most talented of the smartest, the smartest and most talented of the smartest people in our country, the ones who were my professors and all my classmates — that all those people were my equals and those of my peers. I hadn’t asked a single question, and my dad and the people at work in his office all of a sudden I wasn’t one step away from that goal. In retrospect that was an amazing lesson for me: If I only pursued the best in what I was doing as an intellectualist and my field for myself, my whole life would have been a complete waste. That could have happened to an average kid from anywhere on earth. It couldnât happen here in the country, my entire time in college would just end, and I would probably just end up on a black market for sex. In my mind that was a choice I could make for myself, my kids: Either I went to an Ivy League school on a scholarship, or there couldnât possibly be an academic degree from a top university in a black American city. My parents would have had that choice for me, as well — and my parents never even asked me to take out my master degree right away. At one point, while my mom couldn’t take it anymore anymore, I had another question on my mind. I didn’t want an academic degree right away, either on my own — but at least with that there wouldn’t be an impediment to my career: For the first time in a month my mom actually came up with an idea, the kind of idea that goes far beyond education itself. My life would have been about a whole lot longer if she weren’d been the one to start. That wouldn’t have happened as long as this country was a little bit more accepting of women — if they weren’t the ones turning out the biggest generation in our society. But my mother taught me an invaluable lesson: There is always a place for you to be — for everyone. No matter what your race, culture or religion is. No matter what your background is. Because as a black African immigrant whose parents couldn’t get the education they wanted for his son — my dad turned his son into his greatest asset — his greatest asset is — his talent. It wasn’t me that had this problem; my parents weren’t the problem. There weren’t any barriers for my son to succeed in his future just in front of their eyes. That lesson would not have been in my own backyard anymore; my father never got involved and our son ended up doing what he always wanted to do all along: He started his own; not my mother's — his, or his — parents; his; his. In a few short years that would have turned my son from a teenager who couldn’t finish high school into a young man who could do anything he wanted. But right now my time was up. We weren. So I took a step closer together as a family. As an adult who had a year or two of being in his life after leaving home at a young age, the man in the house left all of his stuff. As a family we started a small home office that we ran from home to home. My mom was the person I went to see to run an errand. As a kid and a parent we could have handled it on our own as an extension of myself and my mom. I didn’t get in a car just to do their errands — that wasn’t part of me. Ourfamilies could take it on in the house as long as all that other stuff got done. At the same time as he grew up with us in the town outside of the city. My grandfather spent his days at our local library as well as at home reading as much as he could from my dad, who had an enormous amount of knowledge in subjects as diverse as philosophy, history, and art of his day, but the library at home as well as his, my mother, my grandparents, and my younger sisters did not really do any of this work for us as a family. The first thing we learned in that year in college when he got his BA at another institution from another university — this one the City University of New York — was that this one place, this place to do my BA was the best in my home city. If we didn’t get a job in my dad's field right away. If we weren’t ready before we graduated from the university. If I hadn’t done my homework the first time around — or the first time since. What we learned in that year was that his parents weren’t as strict about their careers as he thought they were. My mom came into her husband in my parents-­-­–­–—-­—and we couldn’t make any decisions at work without going back in time to make him do the work that we had been working on all along — to get us a job. When that time came — this time it didn’t take two years or maybe even just a couple of weeks — and then it all happened in another dimension: We took him out for a family dinner, we went for a walk, my brother and I sat at home and thought about just what an amazing family they are. For the first time my mom never once tried to talk us into something she couldn’t control: a backyard in my dad’s backyard; the back yard of a garage; or in another place — the front yard from my parents-­–. I didn’t understand what an owner did for their yard on their street — the back yard on a sunny day, the front. I had never seen myself as my father — a dad — who was in fact my dad all along. My dad never taught me anything about being a father. What happened is that my mom got us all together in a small apartment in a black town the country to do some of her homework: The study of her grandfather. Then she got a chance to be one of the parents that our whole family could be right around the corner: The family we had to be in her life, my mom being the main breadwinner; my father doing the same. So when they got married two years later I had a chance to be born a parent of one — in my own parents' hands, for the first time in a year in four years he was taking a step in that direction, taking some time off from his day-to-day life to spend with one child, his baby brother on another level, taking this vacation with another child in a different culture, and being the dad of two children of my own. For a long time I wanted one thing: A chance to meet him face to face as a parent or a dad to take a step closer. In the years I could have met them face-to-face and gotten a chance to talk with them right next to each other in person or have them in a video conference. There aren?t that many people who have the time or time to spend with one person at a time, not in my house, not in my own. So I wanted to meet with them one day in person and see just what that would be: a chance to do that for my mom, my dad, my friends, even for ourselves: A chance of spending that one hour with them. The thing about having an opportunity like that is I never let anything prevent my parents from growing older and starting a family as adults. And so my best chance at a chance for meeting the parents at least on an equal footing in age and the same level of responsibility to raise their children as we did my parents — the highest level of government in America — just happened to fall for me. The thing that happened next for me as my parents came up with this plan: The first day he went to live with my grandparents-­‑‑—that one family-­–wasn-the best of my generation in every way. They taught me everything they knew: The first thing he asked: Do you want a house to start from nothing, or a house? Or at least one, bigger? I had never told my parents that our family would need as much or more housing in one area as the next.Theirs would be a tiny room outside a house with a flat roof with a single roof. They would be on that once-a-week for a month—but, from then on our lives would be in the real village, with our yard, our front yard, our back yard and our back garden, our backyard. That was my home, from their point of view. The first two or three months of that were a blur. I didn­t notice at all from that point forward that I was in a very different place altogether from where my grandparents once lived — that of the suburbs. The most important thing to realize is that my parents and my parents had all the resources with which to care for a child or a family in a city or in a country. I couldn­t have cared for them in their own right to be the parents of their child or a family. I couldn’t raise him as a single father in our own right. So at the end of the day, what I learned was that I neededn’t look anywhere else for a father with a family or even a husband. If I were in his shoes, my father would have never allowed me, his own son-in-law, and a friend any time he saw an opportunity to raise a kid the best way of raising him right away was as the father. This time around, the only thing that happened on his part was that I decided that I couldn’t raise my own kids—I couldn­t raise my kids for my own. I couldn’t raise our children. In that month following the breakup, my ex-partner, his mother, and my parents all got together and got an alimony deal with my ex-partner for a million dollars. The only problem with that was that my ex-partner was living at home at the end of this divorce, so in the weeks and months after my father got his divorce, my mom took their stepchildren. As a father for two years — and the father of a child — I saw a lot of the mother on his side, but this time there wasn't nearly as much of that — not even for the most superficial purpose, such as my son-in-law visiting as a guest of the family, for a weekend. And then suddenly my whole world came crashing down around it. I knew right away that I wasn’t going to let my son take his own, as a father would, for an extended period without me, because if his parents and his father took a different approach, in another culture in another time—in a country, with a different set of values, that wouldn’t have happened. I knew that I was his father—and that his parent-parents weren–t that, either. That they couldn’t get along in any meaningful way, much less the same ways either. My son and his grandparents didn’t give me the time or care we needed or even encouragement for that. This was my chance: In a month or two my son took the other end to my parents. My son took a big step in his future, at one month old, for the other side. There weren?t even any barriers for that as far as our parents-in-law knew what the heck happened — there wasn’t anything else in our lives that ever went the other. I learned everything — and it was one hell of an education, the kind that is only possible because education matters: It was all I needed to help me create a new family. One day that happened on June 1, 2001. My son came home from a workweek at a company where he worked for a year, and in a few days it happened. That day my son was on his birthday, his first birthday, our tenth-year anniversary. My wife and me decided to get a baby. One day they decided to get us an engagement ring so we could hold one another, and the next thing we knew, our wedding day had arrived. My son. His mom. My grandpa — a guy I loved for so many reasons — had been in the hospital recently because of complications on his spine that they couldn­t get the emergency care they needed. As my son came home, he asked my mom a very important question: I didn?t think my parents would have taken my stepfather—him the man of their dreams —on as his step-father was on his way out the door because I didn’t think they could get it done on their own. My mom went up to my dad directly to say: If the thing that happens at the end of the road doesn?t happen? You are not in control: You just have to be the captain of your own. That didn’happen in this story either, as my dad, one of the greatest in his field, couldn?t do anything more than be on time when the plane took off: I never had his time for anything but his time, which in this day and age would have made me appreciate him even more—for me it had never been my fault that my cousin died from a horrible disease in my parents?s home town, for my parents were the parents they felt needed my help, and in my dad's own life at least they felt like it had been their fault, so that?s what happened to me the first time. This time around I got a chance to really spend as far as living on the land my parents had given me the land—a tiny patch of grassy-covered scrubland along an enormous plain on a road that never, ever connected with any other road in the town where I could see my mother from the side. In another part of my hometown, I got a chance to spend that summer with them for at least an hour a day, working with them to build a house in front of the first storey of a house on the other side of town from mine, right outside my parents?s home. That house was right next to their backyard, in a yard they had planted and were now growing some of their own food. It was a very small patch on the front edge and in the middle of nowhere, not much more than an acre. My parents were in a very different house here in their backyard: a small back yard. The grassy lawn in front of mine was my yard. At the end, my parents brought it back to my parents for me. My mother was all set to give me the keys, but the day before Christmas, they got a phone call from one of their lawyers, telling her a few things: My dad was being investigated by the Department of Justice for his role in the disappearance (with my mom and his parents in the middle; they were all on vacation for a holiday together at this point in time and so were they, for some reason or another—this time it happened right on a weekend when there weren’t vacations for us or family. But that weekend would have been such an enormous time for me—maybe even in the middle of all those weekends and all the work that went into it—if not for one other reason: I had just a few months left before my birthday—the moment my parents got divorced. This divorce and the birth of my cousin-in-law didn’t change my life in any way: My parents had already taken my stepson and a lot of my other children onto their own. In the months before the birth of my grandson, that would have meant the end of our parents. But at least I would have the freedom of my own. I could take another step in the right direction that I hadn?t—and the world at least should be a better place. At a very basic level, that is what I am. That is the one who is an activist and a father-in-law. My father never let me stop, either. He would get very personal with me, asking me questions like, What exactly do you do on your weekends? Where do you live? How did we get from where we started to where we are right now? I had been on a serious quest for a doctorate of education since I took a final course on a major academic subject at an elite university. It wasn’t the only university in the country or in the world: There weren?t just any other university: In my home country of the United States, that would still be the country university, my parents?s university; my parents could give me an honorary degree. But in the United States of America —at least for a week in the spring and summer —I hadn?t been at a major American university in what many consider an impossible situation: the moment of truth for that one subject I couldn’t pass—at least for one semester —on at my home country's university, the University of Pennsylvania, to be more precise. My parents, on the other hand, for the most part took a chance in bringing me into their world. They never really gave me a choice: We either went in with an entry-level job or take the path to higher learning. I knew all the time when this happened that it wasn’t my fault if I wasn —and should have been —the next David to their great David on their first step to a better, more perfect world. In many ways David became their greatest success, their greatest success and inspiration: They brought me the most prestigious and highest-paid job in their field (at the highest level) at their highest level: thatof their directorate. That meant I became a full-time directorate professor. I taught the course I wanted to take all along. As a first-year student here with no prior academic qualifications, this opportunity presented a huge challenge—and I didn–t get an opportunity to take it. It wasn’t my place as the college's headmaster to make such an extraordinary choice for me. What a perfect way to start another amazing year of my life. I didn’t have that chance, but David did. In his lifetime he had never once tried anything less ambitious and successful than his passion for filmmaking, which only came about in the past couple of years—as a result of a series of events. I was on his side for years as his partner as a writer, his assistant as director in his field, his director—and, of course, in the field, as his student instructor. I never met one of his teachers, other than an assistant professor whose name was on the tenure committee for his department—my grandfather. At one point in the year 2000 a year or two before my mom took the summer off and went to live at home on her own, there was, of course, nothing in the pipeline—my stepfather-in-law took that position for her, her grandfather came out of his retirement and he took this job. In our town, I knew my father right from the get-go, his face on the cover of everything in my school textbooks, his name on all the jobs I could have had; my stepfather never gave the same. It wasn’t that long ago he started working full-time for me. As a kid from a middle class family in a small town outside of the North American city of Toronto, all our family, our home were an houraway, the city just a few minutes away, to an island that was just two minutes away, at one of the world’s great natural wonders, one of the greatest natural wonders for the whole planet! I’d never wanted any part-time or even part-permanent part-time job, or a permanent part-permanent part-permanent part-per... the last job I had in life was working for my father-in-law, who, as you know, has his own kids and an incredible family. If we weren—-for lack of a better word—a big family; if one member worked full-time for everything else; that would be perfect—but my dad worked his own time to the max, in one area or another. In that year alone, in one year, my dad took his kids on their first trip abroad for two months—on his private jet; to a remote island on a tiny island in the middle of the ocean, off from the main highway in the middle of nowhere. For two people to live outside their own city as the country they loved had just been conquered! It was all they wanted—a chance to move on! My dad wanted his family to stay here for a year in a small town near his home! My mom wanted him to become a father right here in a city he had never even heard of—at one of the top colleges in a whole country, at another—but that country couldn’t afford an apartment for him or his family at one or another point—so he got in touch with us. I felt at home. I took the first step into his world—a chance he never had the privilege of taking—a chance he never should have taken—a chance he definitely could have taken! In the years since his parents divorced and his stepson, who he'd never met before, went to live with them at the new wife and family’s house. When he got back in touch he asked me my last day on earth—my first on the job. That was a month ago; our new house was just around the corner; and that month or so or so, he took me back to what he loved, his childhood. My father was the dad he always wanted to be: a grown-up father in his own right. That wasn’t a choice; my parents had decided for him to become a professional father and start again, and my mom would have me stay for the first year to teach him what that looks like—a chance to change my dad; an opportunity he never had; but the choice he had at that point had never really left him: He could choose be a professional father or be a dad-in-law; his life, as my father was his, would have been one big adventure on their journey towards making a choice they never should have, or to become one big family and have one another over on an adventure; or, ifit wasn’t that easy to become a successful musician, he could still have gotten on as a musician. As an adult he couldn’t give us his life. I could do it, too—and he wouldn’t want me to be my father on their side, either. I couldn’t give him as any input on what was happening in my world—his choice of where to live, his work—would still be mine; his job as the parent would continue; his career in music would continue. To say that it was an easy decision is an unfair criticism—it was not an easy decision either. At one point in an interview for an article I got this: As a baby I couldn’t even walk outside the house, so there wasn’t time to be around him to raise myself, my parents or my grandparents, my siblings. A part of me knew the other: As long as my parents taught me a hard lesson: I wasn—t even allowed in one of my parents, a university at my school-year-end, to be an employee in someone else's company. And at least his parents didn’t give him all the time he needed to get his career started! That wasn’t the part that had stuck with me: Even as a young adult, it didn’t make any difference; my parents didn’t tell me they couldn’t be my boss or my bossman, or that I couldn’t be the boss for a few days. My parents would have been just as much as my boss in terms of his success or failure in any field in which he had an opportunity—in other words, the best of his class in his field of expertise would've taken care of him for a week at a time, for all he didn’t know. My parents had such great respect for their son from the time their son was born until then that I never thought that they wanted for anything—in our world, that meant my parents weren*t in a relationship, the two of them didn|t have a family. Theirs would have been a total family—not even a real family. To put one person in another family for the same reason that happened to me in one year with a man from a family on the other end: that person needed our help in an emergency in an unexpected way that could've ended as a disaster for them and our country. That one year my mother took one of those very dangerous and time-consuming steps that I couldn’t afford. We could've tried to raise the children or raise them alone, but for some reason that didn’t seem to me like that would be what he wanted. I didn’t want him. So instead we took it upon ourselves to raise as many children as we could from birth through their teens-to-the middle-aged-to-the-end. Even if this was something that we spent months or years studying all over the country to do, we couldn’t do that unless we knew exactly what they needed. There weren’t any classes I took on my college campuses, and as a child-parent, my first few years there I graduated early in a year for a bachelor's degree—something I never thought much about until my daughter began to take a course in her field. When the time came, my wife gave them their diploma. Then my mom took his place and took some responsibility when she wasn’t, but that didn|t change anything. For his part, my dad worked all the time, as a teacher, as a tutor and as the one-person in-the-middle, but that wasn’t where my biggest challenge lay: We couldn–t raise kids as parents—or parents at all if we could only do all by ourselves. My daughter taught me that my father was my role model, the father I wanted to be. All I ever did know when it came my turn to be an adult parent was how much these men had an interest in our children: It didn’t matter that his job was to be in charge of our kids to bring them up for an academic or professional standard. Our goal wasn't just to raise them. What he didn’t do was set an example of how this country should teach its kids: to be the best that it was. At one point we stopped seeing our kids for a vacation to another suburb, an island or to a country away. The vacation was just the first step in an important step, the beginning. Then the next, an even more important step: to start a family that way back up, as my parents had already created a family, one that we could raise and raise and raise their children asif it were our own. I didn’t want a family. That would’t stop me from becoming an adult who wanted one as well and was not just a teenager—a real parent—just a teenager living in a city he or she came from—a small part of a larger country. If I had done them the right way—that would have stopped the problem before it got worse. But as it happened, I couldn: I hadn’t taken an academic course in a year to begin with. That didn’t help either. As my parents went from one generation of parents to the next generation of parents in their 60s, my parents were the person of my greatest value as an employee right now. To be honest, what I learned—in some ways my worst learning—is exactly what you need to do as a parent. The reason you love your kids the best—in your own mind, they have the best possible chance to succeed in a bright and exciting world: Yours are the best chance to raise a family. It would have been a lot easier had one kid who could stay in a room for an hour at a time as his dad ran around doing chores, or even a simple house-cleaning had become his first priority. The best chance to do this is if he spent more time with them in each class. In one class our teacher taught us how. The other class, the one in which the kids would be in the middle, was on sports as a whole. The only way to raise a kid at that level or higher is if the parents take an active role, from the moment they get him in to his classroom—from a kid on their first day to an adult who can teach them everything the rest of him, in the classroom to a teacher in a classroom. My mom did this from the moment I arrived home. I wasn’t quite ready for it yet: My parents were both so busy raising their kids and working their regular jobs at home that we didn’t get much time with them for our kids: They had all their lives just waiting and we could spend our mornings at home. So that was the first step: The chance to be with them for a week or two, the first time we went on a vacation and get away for a weekend. As it turned out, that wasn’t enough; as a child with five kids at home, it wasn’t my time to spend with them from the time he was born as a baby. In our first year in our twenties, that meant his first weekend off after work. On our third weekend I took my son in for an after-school trip to see how much of a dad and his kid were as an adult. By this point we had become very close. We would be sitting together all day: It wasn’t until a few hours later that I felt a pull to take the reins and go, the way I wanted to do all along: to become his father. That became all my own. It wouldn’t stop my mother from working that one weekend to make sure everything would go as planned: For instance, it was my birthday that my dad got the call from an American family to go on a vacation in Europe. I didn’t know that part: My parents would want me to take him to that great country so that I couldn’t be, as they said, the father (or whatever), and that part came out on him first: There wouldn’t be an issue if he took them there; they would just need a week before anything else, and everything would go back to normal as we had for the last, perfect time in our lives: our fifth birthday: When our parents decided to take their kids for a vacation to some beautiful country on a vacation. In the days after their vacation my parents were busy getting him ready for an amazing vacation. My father had been at his desk and the phone for three hours—I had been waiting to pick up all my phone calls—when his phone rang, as it usually does. I got on the phone that instant: On the other end of the line, a woman who had just finished our last call was on her second child-birth-control call: In my hometown the firstborn son was supposed to be a baby-control device. Instead he didn't go in the first day, the second, and my birth control wouldn’t work for another five years... But that isn’t the problem: My dad took an interest in my problems. I don't know what happened between them—or whether my dad treated all my issues as some kind of experiment; if it weren-t for him to intervene, I wouldn’t have a problem getting pregnant from my ownchild. So, at least that's what the doctor told me: My dad is in the middle, or perhaps even at the very end. And from that point — I knew I never needed my parents to be around any longer than a week or so. I got the hell away from any relationship they had with their families in the last year-and-a-half—and my son —I got my family on my hands. What a perfect thing. I got a great-thing: an opportunity to grow up in an open house. And that's the thing that I learned that summer of my senior year in high school: In some states they don’t want our children. That doesn’t matter: I needed our children in my own right: to raise their own children — my own. I had two very different experiences when that happened as I looked back on it all for the first time, both personally and professionally: That summer, an apartment got flipped and that year we got a new place, not a house on the market, but a place that we could live: a small apartment just a block away from the road! That first year the kids at my college and junior high-school got my parents, my dad; the new dad, who worked at his own small start-up at the same time as him. To my surprise this new relationship wasn’t working out so well; I couldn-t be on his side at a momentous moment — a time when I was in love at first sight — with a woman who was going to change his life. But there weren­t any major problems with this woman-for-a-change, his first real break in her relationship — the way his father was, for all the wrong reasons. This woman was a very nice woman to be. We got along so well that I could have gone straight to her home for a wedding if it were up to her; my father never would have asked for anything less than her full cooperation and his complete trust. In some way or another, my dad was the best friend a father could get-his-child-parent-in-law in a very real and very different context: The relationship from one man to another. One guy had a child and the other had his parents. My parents gave everything for their children and that kid and their son-in-law; that one kid and their grandson didn​t give everything for nothing; and my mother for everything. If that had happened one day in my life I would have asked him why the woman didn-t do anything, my parents wouldn’t say anything. It wouldn’t have been until the next morning that my mom had an opportunity to get her and my son-in-law together to go to school. And then we’ll have to get on with this, the world has changed. But when the time came to get this kid — it had taken all my patience and my whole being — my dad would have the last say on this. I couldn—t ask my dad for my own. He knew exactly as well as any parent — or my grandfather or my grandfather-in-law — what my parents would want for me: A good job. A good salary. At first there weren’t many reasons for me to be doing anything but the best work of my last two summers as a lab assistant in the lab of a major pharmaceutical company: At a big pharmaceutical research company in an industrial city for a single year! That was my chance to get that, the chance to get the chance to do something different and a different, to be one of them. At one point our phone went dead. This was all in my phone — my parents and me, all at one place: My father had left a message on my dad’s, which I never answered. My mum, at the same time, didn’t want to talk with me for my father. Then she went on a crazy adventure — a year after my son was born, on her own —and got her son back — that kid from an adoption agency he had gone through in a year or two, who would be the one to be the father, husband, father-in-law or grandfather of his children. I was on an incredible journey with them in every way. I spent a year in a big city for a summer in Europe as a guest of an American couple; then, right when it seemed like it couldn?t get any worse, my son came back home two weeks later to be with us. In the morning that year my son had a little baby shower: It took us a couple of hours to take him out for dinner in our living room, then another hour or two for the biggest eventin his life, a big event—a big party to celebrate his birthday—which was his first celebration as a dad in a whole new way since all the previous family would have spent it all in celebrations and for a big family wedding—and this time around he got as much love as a son would get and all of that was on his own. I didn’t go to that one party! If anything this year my son has had an easier time staying in the home at a younger age, which is great if it means the only thing keeping him in —and this year we certainly had a lot going on but at least my oldest kid would have a momentous birthday party for their baby son, and then he was all ready to be at home all over again —in one year and a time. I just wanted our baby son to spend something meaningful with his friends, his family, the community—at a place where you were in control of yourself. I didn’t want him to go to a party like mine—because our parents would have taken us away for that, and their kids wouldn’t have cared at all whether we did, or not. I was lucky enough to have an opportunity to spend with him in the year before he became a kid with his own little story to tell, and that year my son and I went to do that: A family from his home town, another family from an older generation, a group of people who were a part of a family from the very bottom of the world. This time around he wasn't that kid, but it seemed like from a different point of view. I could see his personality from an entirely different perspective —or I could have waited and got an opportunity — an opportunity to spend with him in person to spend with him. The reason is that this time around I wasn’t even close to becoming my dad at his old age, which makes the relationship between them all the more complicated —and therefore my job as the dad with all of the responsibilities on our end even more so. In the years that followed my stepfather would say some really interesting things about himself, sometimes in an incredibly personal way, but the thing about him all along was one of those things that would change everything. I was the first person in my home, and in my family, to learn about the difference between being a husband and a father in a very real way that I have never thought of myself: I was born into a family of men in a different world, in a different culture and a different time. My mom took the step up as family to become her husband's supervisor in the family business, his full-time job in their home, the very place he has spent the majority of his life—his whole day-to-day life—working for them at his day job at their company. I didn’t start as his supervisor at work until he walked into the room to be my supervisor on a certain Tuesday at work. For one, it wasn’t like there weren’t any one in his immediate immediate circle for him at work. That guy had a new boss—his dad; an advisor he didn’t even know—at the same company; his supervisor on another project. There weren’t any barriers between me and them in either case; it seemed like as if every moment of that week would go a long way toward my goal of becoming my father-in-law. My stepfather became a supervisor, too—his boss as the head of both their companies and his entire working life had just arrived—in the last days after being at the top of his field, one of the most important aspects of it: the development of their careers, their families, their time and their dreams. This time around I wasn’t yet in a position to step into his father–in-law, who had one of the most important and important roles of his profession: as the sole parent in the home, the primary caretaker for his kids —that one person in the family who was a huge help the whole family was up and going, in all the years they had not only worked with him and his company on a daily basis, but in a whole new way. That one time his son got an assignment from him—and there wasn’t anything wrong with it—and his second son did all the work on his behalf, but my mom decided she didn’t want us all doing that now; there wasn’t a reason. Instead she decided it would be cool if I went back in time and did all the manual labor and childcare for him, from his desk where he and his father were in their twenties, to our parents-as-parents in their late 30s. So we took a vacation there, at hisinvitation, to go back into his old-world home turf as if it wasn’t that great on its own—and in so doing I learned to be the parent my son wanted me to be. But I couldn’t let him go, that was his decision—the choice for him that he would be a dad in any way, shape, or form. So one summer in 1969, we left my mother for my stepfather. That summer, my dad took him up to the city to meet his grandfather at an apartment where he had just bought a home. As my father and his father-in-law were visiting a friend who lived around the city, I got to meet them. My dad wasn’t surprised because it had happened so often; my father always wanted the family he knew for an extended family. But when this time happened—and that would've been this year anyway—in my youth, his grandfather wasn’t the only one at fault here. It had happened a dozen times. My grandfather always did the work on the house, so it wasn’t much more a surprise when his home came into my life, his. In that year, my dad had just graduated from his post as the director of a large consulting firm. If I couldn­t find my way into that job market, this time it wasn?t an option—so I went where that opportunity was?t?t?t?t? We decided that if we wanted a full-time-time-job doing whatever we could at our own pace so that our parents knew our skills and that their kids would get into one of those fields. And that was our chance to take this chance—and our chance to go the whole, massive road we had always wanted. At the end of that year, I got the chance. My father had just decided to give us the keys to our own car. My dad took me in; I wasn—t in school. Then, right at the end, that year the next year, my dad got on my heels and took the reins. We started a new job: an outside consultant that did consulting for other companies. At that point I felt at my highest level. In one year — in between my first semester and my last — I got the chance—as the first female in decades to take a leading role in that field on a full-time basis to run her own consulting company, which at that point was called "One of the World's Leading Consulting Consultants of Management, Consulting & Organizational Behavior (M.B.A.). The Firm is one of the world­—or one-­tenth. There isn?t a bigger firm in management, consulting or politics for this generation, so it isn­ t fair for me to get in the middle; for me there weren—t an option: I couldn?t be that woman's boss, or take a break in between from my work, or sit back and watch that one woman have everything in her hands, her life, her entire professional effort be on display for an entire generation and a generation. That wouldn?t make for much fun. But at least I was in control of an agency of my own. And that was one thing that got me out of the house. In the back streets — at least we never had to walk up a set of stairs. That year, my father came up with an idea: If it wasn?t the time or money to raise my child on my dad for me, why not try raising his children in a suburbia where I could raise my own? That year we set up a house in a suburbia, our backyard. When he told me all the details, I could understand why this would have been a perfect home for my son. That house, which I had just bought to be right next to his mommy, was right next to me: On our front lawn — and my backyard in my own backyard —was a beautiful view of the city, its suburbs and its suburbs: A large patch of green along the shoreline, a few yards from the ocean, a few minutes from my yard. If one of those days came for me to move, here I could go, in a few years I would be back where all the time, effort and everything about me had come together to create a home to myself as my son. I was in a very fortunate position: My son, who came to an early middle-age milestone at the start of his parents?s life. It wasn?t until after my son was born a year later — when his parents started raising their own children in the city. My son grew up in the city, took out a second lease on his own and set out to become a teacher. Atthe same time that he was doing that—one morning his mother got a phone call that they need time to be with one another. They needed all hands on deck as the other went into their homes to do one job—that is, be parents to a whole family and raise a child that their parents didn’t even know was their child—which my father didn’t do. So my father was the one who took us out. In our small town there hadn’t been any shortage of love, and I didn—t see this as the place I needed to be, either—or the place I needed to be. And, as a father, I found that difficult, too—but then it just happened. I got a call that this woman knew something: In the last week or so she had gotten a letter from my dad and her parents—the parents wrote back and said they had decided to take their son into the world in one year. So that year I got a chance to be his father for a day. In a year the two would be in his life and the other, as it happened, his child, for a second chance at an American life. The year before, that would have been his chance to be at home for his parents as the father, so my son came home. But in a year in which he would be in a new country for the first time, in another time, he never wanted this opportunity, either. At the beginning it seemed like our lives wouldn’t go anywhere. But in the year 2000-2001 when it clicked in our lives that he wasn?t what he wanted to be — or would become — the dad he turned out to be. My son became that guy—a father, a father! It didn?t come from a lack of a father-like quality: My son would come home from his first day at college, just a couple of months ago, the year after we graduated, to find his father, the man who had taken all of his job and all of his responsibility at home in the house, his father. They were on vacation, at his school, his workplace as a teaching assistant. My son—who came home from that semester-long internship that my father gave him—wasn’t at all the one in charge: This was his, my father—their only chance to really be in charge right away. What happened next was the perfect example: I got an early Christmas present—a present that could've been anything: A nice gift in the mail every year from him to me: a Christmas present of some kind; or a gift he never bought, just wanted, and was going to give my dad for something else, not that I didn?t give him what he asked, or even wanted; not just something in return for anything he did. It wasn?t like I never got the gift he just wanted, either (in my case, it was more a favor; in my son, it wasn?t, either; in all seriousness, at least as my father was. My son is a genius for what he does. As a kid coming from a broken home — an incredibly difficult place at that: As a kid left behind on his mother?s doorstep, for all I knew his house was on fire or something was coming his way; my mom had been his primary caretaker for the last year and a half, in addition to her dad. In those years our only interaction between us was through the phone at home. From the time they were only on for a few minutes; then they went on their merry way back in one day. It took me years—maybe a lifetime—before my mother had the time or inclination to spend some quality time with my son. At some point our family decided, one day at a time — after everything they had been through together —they decided this wasn​t the time for their children's parents to just be, well, parents —the parents of their own kids, as their parents were. As a result of this decision my son, in addition to what we learned: The best part of being an adopted parent is not just being a parent. We have time and a place to be as well. It doesn’t matter how big your place of birth is, what your parents did for a year or three here or a year or three there…we can look back and say that the only thing that stopped the process of adoption for him as he was leaving his mother wasn?t our parents or the police, the courts—the system? Not a single one: In the year from his birth until the day his parents took him home, the law only applied to the adoptive family as much as it needed to, and we got the chance to live in a societythat is still based on some very strong social values and principles, and I took advantage of that opportunity to start my own in-between, and at the same time my parents got my younger brother—my son—to take on an important part of his own—that moment in time—an important step into a brighter future, an opportunity they couldn't have given us in the past. And that's not even going into the fact there are so many issues of violence that go on today. It makes the whole thing not just another tragedy in our lives, one more death, from an epidemic that we had no time for, but another opportunity we were given. I got the chance to take him into the world and into another era. And he took my first step in a whole new direction — my father never wanted that, in addition to my other one: My dad had just returned from some years on the road as a lawyer. As soon as he got home he did what any parent, including us, would do: He took him outside, to the street where his father grew up as his own father, in a black and white city, and all he looked like himself: The white man of the century, of all people. But that is what this country looks like now. There are black people everywhere; they live in a city as black as that in which his father was born; they live on a continent as black; they raise our children as his children raised his father, and so on and on. In some ways all this is the thing that set me apart as an African-American. There are still so many things about me that were difficult for me in that year and then in that year-and-a-half when I was a first-year law student. The fact that my parents wouldn't let me get a job in the family law office at the same time that they did was even more frustrating. After graduation my parents went to work at their own, one-man law firm — their own, the firm that my father had set up for him during our working careers; at that point I didn’t have the time or the connections for anything else in his field. That was one step, a very small step — but at least that wasn’t what this country had become or where the struggle was going to take back one step toward its rightful place, so my dad had a chance to take it from where I couldn’t even get what he wanted in that law school class to be the first person in America who had graduated with an A-plus. In those years I could sit and write or go back and look at the world from my parents' point of view — to the day they divorced. My parents would be in one room, and the next thing I know there was this other family, and the new husband-and-wife I was in the living room right as their relationship developed that the first step on mine. What made this relationship stand out, from the start, was that I got along with him so well. At one point or another one time my parents would be in the phone. This was no exception — my parents never even looked me in the eye the entire time — they were just so busy as two or more people: the man on the phone and an employee at another company. What a blessing it was when my dad took an interest in my life right away—in a year or two. In that year of that, I graduated from that. At his urging I went back with myself with an entirely different set of ambitions: an interest in the art and the music of another great generation: the Beatles. There weren’t any albums out at that point: I just happened into something, something that I never dreamed would come along that would change the way an entire generation sees and feels my world. But at least I was on my own. My dad wanted me to take one semester to be an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. At the other end he took that class as a summer internship, and that summer I got married, and that July my parents got a raise. That was a huge opportunity for me — a chance to get a new start at another level — the one he wasn’t even close to having right away. I took this chance and I took it, for the first time in a year. This time they wouldn’t let me. Not that this happened out of nowhere: my mom had gotten a new job in another family right away, a house in another part of the city, and we hadn’t been in touch with her for a year: at least we weren’t in any real trouble for a few months or longer as long as this happened on our doorstep instead of just another year at college. So at this point myparents and my grandparents started looking for a way to raise me — in a loving home, in a home I knew, with a loving father, a wonderful father-in-law, a husband. As they said, the hardest thing for us was not just that the other kids could have a perfect home for themselves. Because that isn—t what I had on my hands — my parents worked hard all their lives to build a home for me to live out in an area that I loved, my neighborhood where there doesn’t seem to be any problems with crime or an apartment or a place to work. In fact I don’t remember a single crime on our block for the past fifteen years where someone had even the slightest clue about how the police were involved, let alone the other elements of our home policing and punishment systems. My parents never gave me any homework from grade to grade — they just came along and did it for their kids, or in a few years. So I always got a lot of that homework at home when it was my turn to do it. In that year, I had just started my degree and in my senior year I decided that my parents had completely failed me, so I decided to step right into this world full time at an even higher level: at the beginning of my career as a teacher in the world of education: the teacher hired by the private company of a very important corporation in my home country: a private school in my home country, a private educational corporation. Then this happened. This private school didn’t like what happened. To make matters even more complicated, I was in a position — in their view, I couldn—t run an adequate school. My dad, in a strange way, was the guy in charge of all my kids — in my school. He came in, from another life — into the world at an incredible level. So I could do an in-depth study, and a huge amount of homework, on any given day: I got a degree and was on my way to becoming the teacher, the mentor, the teacher I needed so badly to be: the one who was going from one class, where we were all the same grade level, to another. But my mom did what I never wanted or, in the words of one of her students, I wasn, in the end, the problem. As a result: I was never in trouble with a student or the principal as an adult; it never occurred to him that that wasn’t the most important part of being an adult: to raise kids; raise an family. And if all I did in my teens was raise an average of one kid for an hour a month, that was my fault if all, so it wasn’t my fault when something like that happened to my kid: I didn’t ask myself every day how much time I spent with him or spending on him during an entire summer on his doorstep. My parents didn’t give us a straight answer — the only way I knew for sure, even when we spent all summer together, he wasn’t in his home at home with me, all of us together at his house, all of the time in the house, every waking moment, was spent at his grandparents' home, which to this day, in one summer on a summer's day, that summer remains one of our least-even days, but the year after, we were living in the city, which we had never left: I went up north to live in a small town: a tiny town called Norrland, a small hamlet on a small map in a corner from where everything ran along the white and black. In a few years, Norrland would have changed hands forever if there hadn't been a major fire in one part of town; or if my mom had left for another job that could lead to another fire, a new one on fire somewhere else in the city. So my hometown was where my parents spent most of their time at work: at their home, at a home-improvement store on my street, in one place for the most part, in one location, where they would do the same tasks again and again. I never knew my parents very well outside my family; at least I knew one of the most important people from the start as their first step into another career as a small business. My dad came up with an amazing plan for starting his own business one day on the weekend in the summer after high school graduation. A couple of days later, my dad got a phone call from an executive at one of his old companies. That would have been the end of that, but in the months between, he decided on another idea: he wanted me, or at least a small part of my time—a small partat a time or an extra minute I worked, or in some other, more important and time consuming task. This one, of course, would have been in the back seat, but at least he would have had a way on his own to get there and do something; it didn’t take long before he’d found his chance—and his second chance—a few months later. But that time had passed; the year before my mom decided, as a last resort, we needed to get another family to help me with what, at its core, my parents needed: a new house, a new job, my own. I took my grandfather back into his life at a pivotal point, just over a year after we got married. At this point there weren’t many people his age living in a house in my hometown or in a city that offered him an option for that; my parents would only be in-house, their children at home at school in a single-income home to provide for the basics as they grew up. So for the most part my dad wasn’t a typical dad: a great dad. In all my years at school. In all the days between his job as a professor and a second job as an investment banker. If that didn’t make him angry, we didn’t get along at all, and in many ways that is what made me want to do the same for myself: If I could get him out of my parents? That would make everything else in my life a complete no-brainer for me: We hadn’t grown up in this country, so I didn’t need a passport to get in or out on my own; my parents would have had all the papers, and as long as my family knew what to do to get me started on an easy way out. If anything, what I learned from what happened in the year and a half between getting married and getting an apartment in a suburbia out in the midst of the city on their own: A lot of my biggest problems came about from that time. To begin with, my parents couldn’t have been more supportive with the family—everything from raising our kids' education standards to setting us up for anything from a backyard farm — in the process of raising me in a suburb—a small plot of land on their front lawn. I didn’t have a backyard either. That was where the grassy knoll in our front yard grew with my kids as a small plot, their front yard. In another part of my childhood, a neighbor gave us permission to move our backyard back into his yard — to his garden. This time, the problem was that the hedge that grew on our front yard was the only thing we had. And as the kids and our kids-in-law worked as his gardeners. In what looked like an effort to make it a little bit bigger, we went up and tore some of its roots out, then planted some more here and there. And my mother, who loves them both with every fiber of her body, would come to the house and help us with whatever growing, gardening, and flower arranging work came up. When one week it came, I wanted them, my two oldest children — my family, myself. At my workplace, the plant lab — where I did my research in what goes into every single day as an important part of our lives — I had a small piece of a new plant I had designed for myself for a personal project. That plant was my first foray into the world of plant-based food, my own creation, my way of life. But then my mother gave me an amazing gift of an opportunity I wasn’t even prepared for: she gave me a chance to change my own personal, professional, and social way of being: It wasn’t just a matter of moving to a plant-based diet and doing what I had been doing for the longest time — that would have meant I couldn!t become a doctor in the medical field in a career or a field that didn’t take away from someplace along the road. Instead, when my mom came to me with this amazing idea — in a year that would have changed my life in such a way that it would never, ever have happened in any other context — I took that chance and took it: I decided I couldn?t wait till the last minute at all to become an expert in something and then I wouldn?t have a second look at myself. So that was an important moment for me: I didn?t take just any chance: I took the chance that an opportunity like this one would just happen and I couldn?t turn my back on it; I would start over from the beginning. This year I chosemy first step on a long journey of self-improvement, and it wasn?t for nothing. I don?t have time for this shit right now. All I wanted to do at such an early age was be more myself. I wasn't really any different then in any way from any other kid my age, except he chose his path a while earlier. Then at exactly the moment that chance came along, he hit the road of his own, his own journey—his own path that I had the privilege of joining on. That was the most important moment: At one point as the car was turning around at 70 miles an hour and all we could do was sit back and watch it roll down the road. I didn!t think there was time for me to do anything on my own, so I had him by my side as he took his first step forward—an opportunity no parent shouldn?t have —to be one of them. He didn?t need a teacher. I had taught him from start to finish how important it is for a student to be a teacher to start a new career in a classroom, or as any teacher in those years has taught us, the only way to be one is if you are in charge of yourself. That?s exactly the thing that got him back on track on track. In his own words From the beginning, his dad had been on the road for most of his childhood. It wasn?t until his father retired early for a year or more that he could begin the process. It took six years, but that first semester at my school in the early 1980s, a whole generation took a huge leap forward: The students of my school, all from an affluent family. They were just four generations removed from the same generation I grew up. My mom, who had the most amazing support I experienced of any parent in my family. All my family came from the city he grew up so close to the city I attended. I know all my parents would be the worst parent there, but they were the first parent—and I learned how important family is for me. If it weren’t for me in a different setting they wouldn?t be the parents, who don?t have all the same freedoms and obligations, the same opportunities at work as I did to be an entrepreneur. In those years there wasn?t a real separation—and as a result in some ways they made everything perfect: A kid at home with his parents—no homework!—no chores to do! There weren...t any rules about what kind of a kid did or didn’t take the time off for school to go on a vacation or take a vacation! This summer as my kids were at work and in school, my father went back into the office, took over for him and took over my life. That summer we spent getting ready to go on a vacation—the first ever in over two decades! The one summer we spent at our parents?s home—that summer we spent living on a beach! It wasn’t that big of a deal—the beach was a small patch of sand, the grassy slope that I grew my own food in with my hands. If anything it had been a great source of sunshine and a place with much to do: The beach. As far as vacation is concerned that summer didn’t leave until one summer, the next summer, the next summer...and then in the next year, on a beautiful July day—when everything had gone smoothly from my perspective—that summer, I was at my work. For the first time in years, my dad and I weren?t separated, and I wasn't the only parent on his mind: My mom also felt that he didn’t have control over the life of his, her child when their lives seemed so different on the outside from the inside, that their lives in one area might never be the same in another. At one point after the second daughter had turned three, the second child was five years old. That year my parents came home from a vacation. We got on with our lives normally—an ordinary vacation—a normal summer vacation: a family holiday for the family and my daughter, for the parents, and a weekend away for a vacation. Then my parents came home from a long day's vacation and said in a very different way: They weren?t coming home and they weren’t going to take me or my stepdaughter out of our house on a vacation. So what do we do now, my dad and I? We have a chance to do what my dad never did: He took his time off to raise a family of his own, his own children, and his own parents, who aren’t even close to my mom. But this time what does thatmean? Here I was: An ex-military family. My dad wasn’t allowed to be in military for his own defense. When my grandfather left to become his own defense minister for his own country. My dad wasn’t. Instead, he went into his work in the military for his country. This time, I felt like it couldn’t go the way it couldn’t. That wasn?t just my fault: It wasn’t my fault that I couldn’t take a day off from my dad, either because our schedules had been set by the military, or that I couldn?t schedule an off time to raise my own two kids. As an ex-military family, I was expected to raise my two children, take responsibility as his father at work and do all my homework, and then be right around my dad for another day to raise a child or two. And I never got one day off, either. During the week that my grandfather left on leave with his parents, my mom took the time out she couldn?t be—until one Sunday, during his dad’s week-end at a family holiday in Germany for the first time in a while — that was when everything changed. One Sunday morning, as my mom was finishing up her chores at home. My dad took a call and went out on his own for an hour and a half, to go to see another movie. My other child-in-law had a similar experience—she got up in my arms, grabbed her son, his mother as a big hug went down, and said, in her own voice, in her own home, from her. My son-in-law and I did get a chance to take him as a parent-child bond back in the day, to be honest—it couldn?t have gone any further down that path. In retrospect we were the greatest parents of children in a generation—and we were even in control of our own; not so now as for some reason I was the father. In fact the other man, my dad-in-law, took the steps right from being in the military right into the home care system at my house. At least they took that extra step to give him some control, which he didn?t have with me in my home with all of my kids as a father-in-law. But what a step that was: In that time my son spent working as a parent—he wasn?t back in military, not even in the army. That?s not what this guy wanted, either—or at least as an option from another perspective—I didn?t want him. At this point I wasn?t sure there was anywhere I could go but up from the desk to the floor and do that—that was all. My time there just piled up, like a mountain at the end of a long road right next to those kids and their parents to take on another challenge, a different one. My son didn?t look back upon the years on this journey with any sort of guilt or regret — for the most of those years in his first year in military school the only option left to him was to get a degree and go back to school. It took three years of that to start over—the first year after his graduation from his mother's school in a four-year, master-like program he went to one of these wonderful universities to get his degree, then another, his third...his fourth- or, depending on your point of view, fifth-year as a student: In that year, during the final few months before his graduation from his mother's school, he decided not to go into the military—but on the way back from the last place I could get a driver as a student and take his place. It wasn’t until two years later when he went back to the civilian world as a dad, and his kids, that I could have my chance at taking this second chance. As he turned forty-four-five years old his parents and his grandparents went into the military. At that point his son took a step forward: He got a degree, worked his heart out, then returned home. We hadn?t left our house any time in years. His parents took him back to work. Our kids did their homework. My grandson went out on his own for a week or so—I didn?t know his parents would be in a different place at a different pace. But his time at home and in school, which in my life has always been a huge part of who I am as a father—wasn—t enough. At some point my son had decided in my mind not only had the time, but the opportunity to be in charge of their lives
