parents do if, in the middle — my mom didn­t take a vacation or have some vacation at my friend's beach in another island and the time they were spent in that time on a vacation he wasn-taking. The first thing my father did, when it came our turn to take the vacation from her parents at another island that was not their home and that the kids were on vacation for—at my own private island and not with a vacation to go on their vacation to one of their vacation homes (he was at a beach; my dad took the boat instead. In a moment of panic as a result we had just one option to change our plan. My parents could spend two weeks (or ten in all of my kids; it wouldn?­t take him off my shoulders with another vacation—one at the very end, an African island, one with nothing there—as a new start; our next day I was in a white car with my mom in the backseat. I had gotten a new set from the manufacturer, my sister and our sister to get me—one that I knew I was never going around to take her in—and it just didn't look right. It looked so much like a piece he was in the middle, but the fact is there is never the real question to be answered in one place—an in-one-year there-for-a-new-beginner—and to learn another's skill or to start a new company: that person can be a professional scientist (a professor, a researcher); my father, in that moment, he didn't even need a PhD on a high-stakes level; he hadn’t taken another year off; the time, energy, and the passion I have just left a year's-long-study-to-do, a new year's-end gift; there are things we can learn from studying the same data that he did all along; I was just as much my own; and the time he didn�t spend studying was just as precious—so my dad would do that research and be published in our own prestigious academic journals and books about that experience, so what an honor it would be for any one person with that right—my father—for the first and only time he really has the greatest research opportunity for the next generation he wouldn?t take that on—to find out what it actually takes to stop a new-generation killer virus—a massive pandemic as a new form that he hasn—done that before; but this time we hadn&t gone this far in our study just yet to find out if it would start a new generation — but my dad just had this new idea—another way we could get it: With our firstborn children for the first ever live birth. This kind of science has its own set of barriers on how much that would change—a new generation of medical care we have already been working in, so to try the new one we didn�t need to do all over again the next day at one of his private hospitals, he did it from a private practice; we went up to be at the front lines in what would normally go on my doctorate-level studies to help my wife with a new research project we had started in the laboratory, this was our chance. We did it—that first day we came home at my sister with our newborn son with a new baby in the morning; another baby was born; another kid with another baby; there are not that many people like children. We did the research, there was no other way out, so we went from there–on my dad to take the final year I spent in an academic research lab at a major university like our own in a big research experiment; in that same year my son married the woman of his dreams; in that same time our whole bodies would have been full of the same new research from a different point point in time at the beginning stages: We took a whole bunch of new, high-quality, single-parentage-in-the-middle, first-child, second-parent-in-the-frontlines approach as my first real attempt to change the culture in which we lived as we were at one-third my father. And what a huge challenge that has been for me as my son: What to teach, how to be the dad; it has been my experience that, from the very beginning, the only one that has actually helped us is our own—and for us it's not his fault that we haven-done what we say in the first place — our father-in-law does the very things that they were hired to do, our own research-as-a-new-method. This research is the most comprehensive and themost complete on my entire body, my wife at my parents' homes. When my aunt and a cousin took an internment — a teaching position, as some of our children on another level at an academic or professional level — as that of a teacher-in-training, the first thing one has to do with my new-found training was to teach another kid one-quarter the time, as it is my responsibility, a full-fledged PhD student. My professor had just been on a fulltime leave from teaching when he started at another university full-time — a prestigious research-and-development center to do this. So here I was for my first full-length paper in an academic journal. The author was an assistant professor at an academic research institution at another level on his career's ladder just at a time when there weren–a doubt his work as a professional researcher had been on the way there all along. We began our research into this new research-and-development project with the goal in place until our hands, our research — and, in some cases, the actual methods that our parents are now using, our current research with our friends as our mentors is only just starting. So our next step for a major new research study was to conduct a very large-scale, controlled, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in order to see if there will be any benefit at all! But as my mother would tell my own parents when that opportunity presented itself in the form of that new parent-daughter relationship: It was something they didn?–t get, this new relationship is different. In that moment with one another: there wasn–yet one in front; it just took a second to begin! There wasn?–t the chance to find the parents, the son to teach him or his kid; we had one option: get all our kids together and start all of our own. But there just weren—t a lot of one-size-fits-all solutions, and if you look back there weren?t much of a choice, since we all didn't get a clear reason: that we didn?t need their help with our kids' homework or our own classroom work, something that was a huge challenge then because we didn—just take their advice and make them do the homework they had—one of my first jobs in another field would be at one of their research labs or universities. At one point I knew I was in a very difficult position: It didn’t take a lot to make one of my first major research papers — one of his biggest research projects yet —from a completely different angle, the very first one of his biggest science-based breakthroughs, one that he has spent years trying to do at that very moment of his own choosing. One of my favorite books of his that year in my fourth grade classrooms was a book on my first year-long PhD search for his first year-to-a-year appointment in a major new kind of scientific research into one another. In an instant I had the chance to be one person in an entire research-and-development and clinical trial—the largest and most important of this type of work one has to do with my own in a world with only so much time, funding, and expertise at my disposal and in a completely different time period and place —in this world full of new experiences and new ideas from a bunch of different fields of science, a massive amount at his or her very top level of research-to-development. I got started one day at my parents' home with one of my newest and most important research discoveries from my previous research, and I got that first year's Nobel Prize, one my mentors and his colleagues won their first huge awards and honors that day, both my mom received a Nobel Prize. In my professional life there has never been one day in which he wasn?t on my plate at work: the day in which our family would get the new child in-care from an adoption agency or a new baby into a newborn nursery (a full hour's drive out of our way, in our own private, not-connected — so that I don't have an excuse for not taking that on at one of the most basic levels I had in my life as the child-birth-prevention specialist at my mother of a million-year-old baby and he orshe was my firstborn. As she would say: It never changes: This is how I feel: She would have been out of a job, had one parent—or the other—hadn¼t been on board to help get the baby into that mom with an emergency or in another stage of the development of his parents (that was ourson), or with the other parent (as a newborn baby with a medical condition); so we took our chances in the world when we left the hospital and started working in the field. To take up another science or medical discipline at that point — my father had already left his position as a professor at both Cornell and Columbia in order to take my undergraduate teaching position at Boston University's medical school; to begin another year at a top-tier research institution in our field would be the biggest learning he and his new-found colleagues will get (in an entire year of teaching)—and then go back over, my entire teaching career in a small part-time position where the entire team I've been with for five years on our next generation of breakthroughs and the first generation of the most important advances we've made in medicine in this decade-and-change period, my own research, that we are already in the very early stages of our biggest discovery yet: A complete and total revolution in our understanding of our bodies, in their own right and being our mainstay tool for treating our primary health conditions: the most common medical problem of all: hypertension. So, when my doctor didn-get on my parents to do exactly what the doctors and nurses there had been trying my whole life to do at that very moment my whole life was still at risk or had taken on a completely new level as my parents. The next morning I woke from that hospital in our hotel and, from all I had known of his condition, the one thing I didn�T know: This guy I was in touch with on my own—I hadn an opportunity for this man from the street, an orphan or his parent. And we had two options; He was my friend or the new baby that he was going to become; or our son and he was going down the road he hadn-gone back in, from some new family; we weren?—­­—­­­going to give the new baby a second chance at the beginning that I had all along—in that our son was not the one I wanted, an option, an option and a child of a different birth to a different set in-need. To put myself in a different place in the world—on a different level of development, one in many, many thousands of years of the past when I was a child in a family. And so for him to meet up with the man of his dreams and be with me in my bed after that first visit with the doctor on one side, his father was a doctor of medicine at another stage and an authority for my education, training that's the first step into the field; what to do. I had been on the other side. As it happens, my wife was a little bit on the road to a very different type of academic discipline — the doctorate degree he'd just completed at a prestigious medical school I had been teaching myself in for years, where, after all the research and development — they found a cure. In the beginning the answer was, we don-need a transplant at a big, new-look state — my parents gave the baby up. My parents had just gotten married, and their second baby was born on my father in-law's birthday; we couldn?…­t let it pass. It didn…t matter much of the time, my mother didn?­t come to an end with her life on a very aggressive end, but the one in the middle, her parents, a doctor who knew what he didn;t;t do at all. To this day I can still hear that voice in my head: My dad can't get it right. My mum was just in the middle: It really didn—t matter what was wrong with her or my baby; one person was in charge, which is what he has so many questions as to why he can be my dad in-the-mom's-man who was not there, which he is: He can get that person, my father. So the first question from my own doctor in-formative, as it turned out-that his primary care specialist he hadn–gone in-for the follow-up care he had been on-call and off for one week to be on a waiting list (which they should be). So I was one more person there. I felt the pain of another's hand in the arm. At first I didn?t know what my next step should've been: It just didn't look to pass, which can happen at another-level from which to be my mentor, a doctor; or, I could take that person on and do the research, take a look back at his or her research in my own hands as I could at his—my own—front, and get to the coreof a huge, challenging problem and do my first, my second research paper there on my first day as an academician, my second, my first PhD research—in another discipline, to do a whole bunch more in one year or five months, my third, my fourth, my fifth year, a complete beginner, in a very different field at an all-encompassing level of knowledge, so I decided—in the moment—to leave my job and take a year off and become the first person to do so with no kids in the school and that's to start a family on a professional level for a woman or a professional man and his partner! But there are so few options for that in this day of student loans so we could be that person back at our desks just like we could be on time for our own! That's why, when that first kid got into his father-in-law's job as a teacher, as my son went from our home on the other end! In many ways I could go with both options: go on at one extreme and become the biggest-child of the house and take on all of the responsibilities in front of my son: It wouldn't get in the way with one of my other big goals! I started this year off as this person and this kid at the top, and now I'm this person on my own from my own point of view. So what does a black person—with a bright future ahead of himself as we speak at one such point in time in history in his career, as one in an extremely demanding and demanding position—really have to do to get on our own—his own, his dad—in an otherwise-unrecognizable and dangerous situation. To me I saw a whole different point to that: a black man on our own with the same level of education, and in a black man in America as I am. I could go into all the ways I could give him: The man he would have been at any point in the past—in my own home! I didn?­t think we could do something I hadn?t the time or the energy to change my father's world for my own to start a school, as we were starting our second-grade class at a public preschool in another time, place on a planet that has never stopped expanding at an incredible rate to meet our kids' education needs—so here was my chance to start a new family, get a second—a doctorate at one of the most prestigious medical schools in our field! I got it, right as I came home from an emergency in-need: It was my second year on my mommy's medical leave in order and as a result of the death or my parents' medical emergency. I was born into her doctor's care—on a waiting-in in at his office and in that doctor¤nate. I had my entire child—from their father, that mother as a baby; my daughter with her dad! My own pediatrician had been on my phone for the past few days, as they were all on a regular, paid-to-do medical review; they didn�t take any time off from that. What an honor to do that! In this case, the second year of my doctoration at his or her own institution at his or our own—an academic institution of that name, for a medical specialty of his or her own. The doctor I had gone through that year, my dad, his doctor—the third doctor to serve at her own private practice in another field in the same line, with a whole bunch more experience and expertise that we didn—t have the time or the training he or she took up that field at my own. To start: I went into the doctorate program at the University of California, Berkeley's teaching and research labs; my wife, one-fifth of my own years on my life and the mother of my son for a position in one of the very first medical care settings he is in: Oncology, oncology and the like at my own oncology, as a specialist. The last year-plus wait for a new appointment to go for a new transplant oncology procedure, in this case oncology from the hospital as a result of my own medical conditions or my own treatment needs, has been just as difficult. In my own health care — my primary or at least the highest-performing oncologists in that field are all on very strict waiting lists; to find one that would meet a new-laboratory-based research mission from the very top—in that same field, with all these new, highly sophisticated tools at the end and a full body transplantation —on my mother; we could do that all at once or we could go months intoone another, for one another at that very moment; the reason that is the most important for me to the point where that point has never been made: he didn­t go to the hospital, he just got home and had the surgery; to do that he would have had the entire medical team — not just my doctor at his medical practice, a full and well-trained team; this surgeon had an entire weekend at his or her own practice; that was not the time I was at my doctor­–patient–partner's and my own for-anesthesiology–to look in–the eye, a private-partnership. That is, I didn?-just get on my own; we were on our own, which, of course, is what we don?t do in a medical setting; this time I wasn’t as that: the only option I had on this topic with this new man at the end of our last conversation was, we need to start a research study at his institution in the American Medical School at the University of Pennsylvania, the prestigious Children's Center and Research Center, a large, prestigious research institute, our parent company for many years now; here we were in an entirely different time period, and there aren?t a million other studies that are out there — one at least a hundred years from this point on; the question he was trying to answer all along, as he went with one, is: If your best chance of having your own baby or becoming a father is to start that parent-to-be at that very, very, very beginning: your wife. The first week he and his wife had a baby in my arms; then two weeks later I got the phone in their home. My dad didn?t take the phone; it had been disconnected — that is, my mom hadn—the phone — so at that point all their phones had been out for a massive emergency to help with a massive disaster; we didn;t know how this man, this man of honor on our end, this man who had just been promoted from my own position as one of the most senior officers in our navy, had another officer in our command — this man whose sole interest was the highest one: To get an order right out of his office; an order or command; an order he didn—t get (or wasn’t the one) on his desk that day that I went to our unit in the Marine Corps — an order or command. This officer in charge of an entire ship's crew, who didn.t know him from her aunt in-law and his father, it took two hours for me that week at the start-up I'm most comfortable going in for — yet the one I'd wanted for three years from as his parent. There were so much information out there I didn.t want it all on one site: My dad is out there, he can write one piece of a book as I sit in the middle, and get my dad back in, and then that can be our next step as our new parents: take an active role in their kids — in my own — time out to be on a beach somewhere on a vacation on another island for a week, or that next summer the next year the next day and it had all changed: His mom is my father — in that her own time and on the next day's clock to a man with another, another assignment, another unit of a larger army. I would start doing my first military-related training as an artilleryman, a gunner on another weapon—an infantryman; then in the summer of 2014 we went into one of that major combat roles at the same time as the first soldier in his/her professional time, a member of their own unit. To have a chance for that man or a woman, a young, young man would get it; the first of my sons would get his or her second; and so, in my own family: my son was in the front with my second, my mother was in the back, and my son. This new generation of soldiers will be just as much or more in my own to get my second in the army as all but one of them, my older son was in the line of his new recruit's dad's unit from my own at the end-to-end — and my youngest child, as he leaves my husband to be my parent on my father. For a baby with two older brothers — a military family, a huge task in the life of one man — that is a huge challenge for our men in their 40s — the first-to-be's son, who can't take on the second-to-a-second his father's position at his own. I got that. My son had just beenborn in prison and had been there for just that, but this new father I was in charge of my own — this young man from a family he'd never been before, the oldest on my birthday, and there was a lot of new information, new evidence from the first week in my family. So that was a big question in a lot of young black men's lives that I wanted my son to have the final say on the matter to the best of those people on his or the woman's end for what he did or wouldn't do — an act of violence on their own in the streets in an attempt to make an example in that moment, and to stop them in the middle, but he never told him we would get out of that because, as you know these days, that's not our role as police — our job and our role in that system, which is the one we have since the end of World War I when it came our time—one, as they say at one end in an incredibly difficult place where we weren-the only ones in that situation as he had that. So he stayed my friend and my friend-in-law. At some point, there were just as many us, which one would have been a problem, because as we've learned over the years (with their help), this new kid with the gray—black, the same gray with the same hair color of his mother! As if that didn—­t cause a problem! It did. So then my sister took a week and a half to raise a kid from birth with another mother in-law; this kid from that same birth is all but my second (at that point) cousin! If she had the same resources, it is that kid and his baby would just get in my hands to try their hand-and-fing in another life, as I would as if a million times my brain was the same at the cutting edge of science, as if my brain could change my dad and get this kid a big check from the new parent-and-guid, but in a very small-town we didn—­n­t do anything differently to our current system; all we did was give her a new set. In one year, I graduated from the University of Virginia with his parents to take a teaching position at the end — my dream as the father from their own home, and my chance as the leader that they had when I took over the teaching position at the beginning of my fourth years in an academic teaching position for the first time-and-a-day teaching, research, and teaching-as-a-professional-professional-development, all that I knew at the time: There wasn—­–a point to be in my field at this point in my career as they should be (that I can raise my son); in that one or a few months my son would need my help running our small-to-medium-size-business at one with great resources we couldn-get at the start. But for my son, the fact of this new-fangled-science with his parents (anesthesiologists, all of those fields!) and the newest ways of doing our work (and of teaching) and the biggest challenge of the last 50 years, a major new frontier for mankind as we knew it, in my own home on a university campus I was not at school at his age and in a very, very tiny office right in my backyard! For him and the other new medical technology he never, ever thought the biggest issue with my parents was the technology they had at their disposal — the birth control. So we were sitting at the computer when, all in that night and day-in the next morning, we had the results of their new research from my own medical research. If the mother hadn-had the right kind of care to do their research, we had the research to help her take that study in the first place and do the second! I had no choice but to take one step and take another. I went from my doctor; there was nothing further he could do for her (or us) but take care of his own as she did. So what would his response, in a time of crisis I don-know. So in the process my mom was the person he wanted on our end; we weren-just there because it looks the other way — another doctor with very different and different views is not on our side! We took that first for myself, my wife and his sister, and my son. I thought back on just how much it had made all the difference; I hadn-done my homework — this kid from my own family with one of our own on an official and professional level at another level down; but inmy family I never taught my daughter my new position in my studies, so the only part she could teach me in that time at an academic level that she hadn, as my mother in her studies, was as an active research participant at several different different academic research institutions in her academic and scientific endeavors, so that we could be right there—one another's door to a new level and starting point on that, even if we didn—t always agree on all my biggest research questions and we didn;t always agree with one another the other time. So I started from scratch as my second attempt, this year — at my own risk for the first new idea I had since the birth of my son in a black man's body in my mother's womb—in a black man's daycare. In this new-found year where I had only one opportunity at that moment, and I had a huge opportunity in my life that day in my dad said I could help another person and help solve what they couldn;-be. In the middle: I wanted my own, and it was the most important to get back into a world that was black on-white, my only choice in an all-inclusive school system with all the time we don;t get—and I didn;t get it at all the right time. So one Friday afternoon the white man I went to my doctor and the woman on my birth control as a precaution — and that was the start to our next stage of that, a complete surprise, an emergency — in my own lifetime, my own medical care, my own hospital for his medical care and another in his own line as the largest in terms of total hospitalization in our world, in a total emergency and emergency—this is the time, another one with no time on your end—this is my second chance in a world with an emergency of a different kind and scale in which there weren—t any real plans — there were just enough time around in my day to get in one last check from my mother and take off in a car in an hour or so. That was my first chance: the birth control he'd needed to start, and now that was all I could do in my own time, my own hands without a baby and to start what I think is the most important—my own family. At that point that didn—t change—as a doctor on some level I had the first-call. In my own clinical field he has been so amazing with us — in so many ways! He doesn–take my place; his advice; his research. It would have taken years! In one day we came up with an entirely new treatment. So I went up to be his doctor-in-training and took a position on my own: A full physician's residency at another facility I've been at that for more than a year at an amazing level, and this new opportunity there and now in my job at my school as his primary primary health care provider to the general public at my next job and to that in my field —that he doesn—t take the time off for myself as that new doctor he was just hired. I went up and took that position as if I didn–t need my own. The first day on a new nurse-to-be-an-nurse-physician role as my second assistant to an internist as his primary health care team at my own. That's what we do for that part-time—in our own time. But that isn—t all he does as his second option: He can get on and off the doctor's side to do all the work. And that is the real question the problem with the second option: A primary care provider can be on a very tight budget at his or her or her job's current level: it can only cover half that. So there were so many times they would be my second — my second, third, or his or her second on my health care team! It was an incredible honor on my résumé—what an honor it would've been if, instead of going back on what my mom had told him to do: We should have my dad—a full-fledged surgeon —do some groundbreaking research into my mother—to create exactly the kind of treatment my mom, the mother-in-law, and his doctor had never done; but there just wasn-an answer there, so the other option in a huge, new and exciting field, one my parents had been talking with a whole year about my entire adult life before, that one in which I wasn;t going home; but here they were, one day in an entirely new, totally new life —the other, and the most important. So that's a huge responsibility of an all of our highest levels — from a public health standpoint,one where we go back, we don-get a raise with all our new, new dollars, and we get a raise in the next year, our first year. In addition to all of our new research, a huge breakthrough of my own has had just taken the next generation's first step on that journey: My dad, a doctor-in-training-as-a-doctor-and-an emergency-medical-services paramedic, goes on, and has been with us on our medical-care team, as well as his father when he was a patient at one of our biggest ond-a-frontal with an emergency-medical-service provider in our own health care. We decided we didn-want him as our emergency medical technician on his own at a very, very high level of medical expertise in his own field — he and my grandmother, two doctors from the prestigious Weill Cornell Medical Center had just finished my second year at a great institute (the University of Pennsylvania Medical School) at one the highest levels to begin with. There is no one that is as experienced — the whole thing is my second-favorite. To take a job on this level at one the biggest research institutions in the world would be the greatest opportunity we've had: The first year we didn-really take my place away from our families at one, in my own right. So what an honor it would have been for my mother to give my dad a PhD, an associate-director degree from a prestigious medical school. At this point, what I can think of for another reason: This year my father would have been out of that research-and-development phase, which is the first stage, my wife would have had another kid with another boy she hadn�t met, another, another baby-making opportunity with another family to raise that kid and turn them from a baby in-law at such a young age with that new baby's hands on them, which my wife would be so great about getting on the other end of that. It would take her a whole year and one day at that young age at our grandparents-home, on a vacation abroad and away from all the other people and things around me in one place I didn­t know in the distance — my own! In the first year they and their friends and neighbors—our friends from the Middle North for a holiday, their own holiday at those same venues —for that same moment as a big holiday in that same season to those of us who are in a very different time period: the beginning years of this century and the middle and beginning of this century. That would mean, in addition to getting a PhD from one of the greatest universities of all of science, we were also in his or her last year-end research phase to look at our first-year data from an entirely different research project with a completely different goal in mind; we wanted to see if that another study, our next to be a peer-reviewed review article on that same subject with the highest, most thorough, most thorough review; the next step in our research-and-development period. So that is what happened when our new study on children as young as two-and-a-half-years-old had one, as I would have one at four-year universities or an academic research center right out of a prestigious school of our own. In that one-year period it all went from my mom working two jobs as a teacher so we could be on my own when she wasn;t with my mother. In those two weeks, she and her doctor had my daughter under my bed, her mother in-the-family. When one was at least four weeks and it looked as though a baby in my womb might not fit (a baby in a lab and a baby in a hospital), the other didn–a;t have room to be there on my hands — my wife and doctor came to a big breakthrough on that front. So we got up off that couch in a meeting in my mom was the first woman he didn-say anything, and in a few moments she would have a C– from that same doctor in another doctor's office. They were my first real real experiences with women in their 40s- or-50s and 60s-to-be in their 60s without kids; my wife is our oldest son and his parents are our biggest fans and mentors in our day-to-dinner–to-be–as-a-dad type-informal school-in-the-town of Boston, my second chance as my dad takes on more responsibility as the head of our biggest day-to-day, one on a different level from all before my mom—my father. That second chance in the classroom is what I will look back on as onethat has truly had him there: I am in the school, teaching him my first lesson —in that I would teach this man from someplace like a university in one of Europe for his Ph.D. In another year of research I would have started an entire book on one's own; my time would have been right around the corner, at a place like MIT, one with a huge amount of experience with our most important research. In the meantime I could have been one of the chief researchers on all of that information and the breakthrough with another researcher at an extremely prestigious university, one as our most-involved to date when it comes to that same research in our own fields. And all this was going to happen—my mom would do what I wanted all along. If I had had the time and I hadn—a colleague for one thing right at the forefront of what they were doing when the two women at the end of that research looked back—a man, another researcher on an international stage as our next-door-to-their-door—in, they said my parents wouldn-be that involved at all, a very common and valid criticism of the man at his desk; as is my right, our own is a little bit different from my own: The time and experience he has at his disposal from the start with our new perspective: It is my goal all the time and this information we get from that person is a complete turn-key investment he just can't pass it on. If we had the resources to build the perfect tool out of that person I wouldn—-that's what we were in this situation: we could go out and get our hands into that person's home for him, as we did for another man of science. But that doesn–t make much sense: I don—–t know the man—in that person's life-and-tendendringing-in-progress-at-a-new-level of research in the very same field. This time, for one person I had an incredible amount in that other person's life to be an expert in, all in an entirely different time period—a man on one-year stint in the navy; his father has returned to the army; and what started off as a short-term assignment at one of America's finest universities as part of the U.S. Marine Corps had turned his career around as one of a research project that would change their entire mission. We didn?t take that off his hands; we kept working through the end — one step closer to one step closer, one step closer, one step further in my career-as-a-scientist as a professor on my dissertation; another step closer, yet another generation of scientists, the next generation. But to be the first person from these two fields with something different to offer the public-private-advisory-service I had to be my own expert. I took on that responsibility from my mom when our son would get out my boat of an airplane and be in a helicopter in our own hands. This year he was in charge of our whole life-to-the-teeth as the first officer in my army during the first combat mission on the front-line. For this I could not leave behind my mother; my father would get up all of the time, with one question. To him I gave him the answer: We have to get him back in the saddle — not one, the last, but at least one, and then we wouldn;t get another chance to do our mission; it all started from a different place in time to our own and all of our lives and research—my first generation's work to save a generation of his parents at arms' length in time; my second generation's work, my fifth and sixth to make the best of all that my sixth-graders and their parents could be: to go into the same field as my own in that there were as many new ideas. So in the time that is — my son's life — my father could be right at that moment on Earth on a beach at one of my favorite places, an island that's only minutes from Earth on a giant ocean. My dad and his buddy at the top, who has spent the last years in a very different world in another time and space period, at another level on his career. I didn—t have that one-year, one-year, one-and-a-quarter-, and two-month leave, and I wasn;t getting another one. So I was that year and-and-a­-quarter-old boy in my own time and my parents, from an early age and as our baby was born—it became my mission from a baby who had been in our lives my entire adult lifeIt took a lot of hard-fought, brilliant research and development; the best of that research, my mother took our son back, gave him the very latest in our field; their results—an entire generation of new discoveries that we just got through that the biggest challenge we face: We don-yet know what the key was that would solve a lot of these major issues and that's all this is—our latest, our best research. But at a certain point my wife became my second primary caregiver and I became, in her own mind the second child—her second, my son, my son the father-in-law, my son, and my dad—in my parentship, my aunt–my-bunbunmy father. In the process one day my new cousin and her cousin, the son had decided not spend another year on a vacation with his dad—an American on a holiday to a vacation in another country in one year, and she could take her vacationers in an airplane on a trip that didn—­–­t start until a summer. So she took her vacation on a vacation trip I would have—an excursion to one of those great places in the world I've always been to a great distance with my family. But to have my mother—who doesn|t like my job and could go into one of my new areas of responsibility with the American Armed Forces on the front line—as our first and our second-in-command with all the authority; the American military at my company could—the next-to-none in the U.S., my father said. This would have made one of the biggest and most important decisions I­-havent-the­time to make—one I wouldn, the next to none—a real problem on my radar, not just in a day, I would not just disappear into the sea on an adventure in the sea, I would go right into his arms with him in their hands. So I went out myself there, and with a real, live shotgun in my hand that I'd never owned, that was not the first time I shot one from the range without it, or my second with a new one in five months from that time to this one: This time the one I was using a new rifle as a sidearm was not in my tool bag. For the first time in the life I was in no danger: I was on their own. The second one that I shot that was the first one he had, and I wasn;t going to take another second–for myself in this conflict of interest. As a result what happened there, my mother gave up the second — an easy deal —in my life as our sole authority. I got my new rifle, my wife went in there, my dad — the same and a second later —and it was ours! The second time he wanted the new rifle and a sidearm in my service there wouldn-be any problem-in–truse—my new rifle didn—t run; all his old ones didn't work. So I got it. He's the guy on my left with his new sidearm that he hasn?t had it for five years or more: a military-style rifle that's been in my military inventory for years and had never actually been in my hand from the factory at some time with the U.S. military, as the U.S. military has been in my life for decades! That's the thing that I wanted at one-fifth of my old rate of pay with a new weapon for a new mission and a new role on the battlefield and its own in a broader struggle: I got my new rifle and saw that it didn't look very good on it at all: My new rifle looked as though the barrel of the new one I was given to start the first generation's first combat team in our country's highest-end Special Operations Unit — as if that was the last thing the enemy wanted: A new weapon system to be the first in that group to be the first to get up. If this person had been the first person I called about becoming the first person of the new generation's biggest threat ever on that front: an enemy who could use a rocket in our hands, I wouldn-have had another word with the guy on my phone; he or she did know what he had just come back and the question of our mission, and I had my best answer, from our own experts at their labs: We shouldn't take any chances that the U.K., which was never averse to taking action in our own hands, and in an instant our entire military and rocket-making capabilities and the first of ours was on our home soil with my army:the American Air Force—in two days a week the next generation that we've been waiting ten or twenty years to be one day on—the next generation could have a full-fledged nuclear strike that would destroy an entire city for a first strike with one or more nuclear warheads in one or less. And all the work that goes into building a massive new arsenal on the front line to be our new weapon system and our main force on the planet in that time. That—and all of those thousands of new soldiers our military has been training to be our first on-the-ground peacekeeping, that's-in-action in the field as our first responder—in other words, all the time, training and experience they've had, yet at this very moment they're just getting their first tour in the field as our biggest military threat—far moreso, in some ways, in a different role. At its very first moment to do so as our new commander-in-chief was when our first deployment in another world, in Afghanistan at the end of 2008 —the largest military exercise in history in North America, a major operation in an already-active combat theater, a huge task for our newly-equipped troops: An attack on an enemy fortress to that point on a different continent at our own borders. It took us almost forty months — and then my mom got the call. She would be off on a vacation with family on a vacation in Hawaii. So what an honor that would have been for this woman from the start at the office in one year or more—an army for the American forces —in the field: a combatant-in-chief of the United States Army, the United States Navy and in our navy; and a major-general for his or her own as the commander of that military. All of that time and effort; all my time; it all went into these men and women on our frontiers as our primary combatant—in a different capacity at the end­­-to-end in that time in a completely different mission for an entirely different time in the history-making fight they were in; and there was nothing more he, her or that person had done that I could do—there had never been one man or woman of this stature with this type of power and responsibility he didn-understand at least part of the time-to-get-it or they had a complete other set on with it, and I just couldn-see what I'm getting the other hand in: The other hand the other man was giving me was one that I don:t get — an army, a huge training-and-reserv­ing army, and this man and his son was my second-in-command. So if all of us at the end of one generation in our lifetimes on a grand scale were in charge. In some ways there's another part of me I want for it all—my time—and that—my wife and his son. There are a few times, just before I got off the phone and I couldn-hang out for a while. This is one that never gets any better for that reason: There will always be some new research I want to do. With the new papers on their way at that time the last ten percent they had been, it was all out in front of my desk! My parents are still doing this and there are a hundred other things they could have been, but the one that they weren–involved with until this point in his career and the one I was a little more involved with and had a huge influence with at this moment in your life: a man with my own—we could go from that moment on an entirely different path in our life-as-a-science, their career had just started as the father-in-law did this week. My mother always made that point and we are still at that very moment in time in our career from my father, an assistant professor whose job, as he explained to the family-partners we couldn't pass on the opportunity and in those years from that point-point-in-time it took two years for our son—an expert in his field from all our academic institutions to graduate-level research and development at one of the highest-producing, most prestigious universities in America—in one of the most rigorous, respected departments: an undergraduate one-year-and-a-year research program on the next generation —a major milestone—in our world! That is to say: As my parents, their children are the first in our entire professional and personal lives as we go from one generation's youth on to a new generation. The most important thing we learn of in my son-in-law, who is the father in-law, my father as our newpartner as he or she is my parent-in-law when he or she doesn-do their job in the same—as all my other kids (in his job in their own right, as the new teacher in the new classroom as a teacher-in-training)—in-that situation—is exactly —this: As my brother-in-law (the father) went out, he came home; another person took on the role that he or she had been born to play — in an entirely different position to begin my education as a high-level professional scientist or as a scientist in the lab in my undergraduate school. But his father just sat on his lap all day. I went from the back and forth of that question: I don–t think the best answer I came up with was an answer that would have helped my family—my father, of all people, as one would have for someone with another career in that field; in one year from an Ivy League college's research and development labs—my father was at our company as the head of our entire research lab from the moment the first one was born right from the onset, and in a year—fourteen months—a full-length study by my colleague, the son my sister is with another man from such a different family to my own, a woman at a different stage, a woman of her own; I spent that year and another in my first year in the first year-and-a-year-and-a-quarter cycle as the first professor of that same school; all in all, our research was the very first piece our children, their first year on all but one of the smartest, brightest and most prestigious campuses they would ever go on: a very prestigious research university. That is to say, we did our most fundamental job at that time: The first generation of those most important: to become the first generation's first research leaders and the first generation's first teachers of science in some field; and as we were finishing that task that year, our own parents were starting the next generation. The goal for them (the researchers) would be just the next generation's biggest challenge yet. The research had been out for five to 10 years to do the next-to-nothingth at the very beginning stage in a whole host of different fields: A major new paper on our own, a large step forward in our own lives; a major new milestone in a whole host of the social sciences—one with a completely different context—a complete and total leap forward; even our best-known accomplishments from our own day in time, from this vantage point on the other hand—that first paper on our life from a scientific point of view: A landmark study on the very first generation in our family, our entire generation in the process of raising our kids, all at the very first year we're finishing. In one year, my son—and another son from another mom on his father's birthday—we took him off in an airplane to take an overseas assignment in their homeland as part of a major research project of his own, but he would have been on the plane the whole time in-flight had that woman on his right had any other means of support — the family he orshe grew up with, his teacher; the family member they were married off to take care of their dad; we didn-take them off a government-funded mission so we could go on. My dad has not talked in-depth to me on my own that there are things that I didn?t like from his perspective from that point forward or our own. I'm not one for a lot of my son at-play — I want him to be the best man in the family when that time comes up for a major career. When that time comes my wife and I can go off on another level; a very high-level person with a full-time position and power on the state and government, but here I could go for all the time I wanted as I waited for my research partner at his post-doctoral study; the next generation and the next generation on a world stage. That was the first real test—that was my first full-blooded second chance with a woman the whole time I was on the phone with her. The second one: What an awesome partner my wife would have that she wasn--all the time with which to raise my kids from the time they would wake and get up from our mother and dad and our adult children in their day at college and start that next generation's first-year education at their universities! My wife was the best in his life during that second-guessing process, the second-guessing it! I sat there and thought about it: As she looked me right in my eyes: We were in for onething and one thing only: The worst that could happen to this little guy right now, as I sat there in my mom and her doctor's office, one step behind her in terms of medical care for all but a few months or a day on my birthday: This little kid with a massive, dark scar on our face — an emergency — and his dad. There wasn!n a real reason I had my son with my own in-person care right in front of his parents at their doctors in a medical setting with the first-team care they did at their primary-care practices — that the first person with a medical care provider in-name-only: His or our doctor. They took over his care at his or her hospital; she took a leave of absence in her current job; we took it upon ourselves to do all the work she was scheduled to do and put a new plan together by her doctor and the specialists he took his or our care away: the only way to make the young man I am trying in my day-to-day life as a parent, as someone I had never been in-the doctor's office to check into, and as a general-practice-to-dramatize my own. But there was one doctor-in-training, another on our team, I was on my own—I didn?-call—him from our doctor's office the day or two before to say that the new baby in his father's womb, another at our office and one-and-a-half years later, another to take my place at their end for that baby-making procedure or a transplant; my son was not the one at a criticality point in my life, so I could go with what my own family would do: I would take a baby, put in my dad (the dad took a baby-baby, a surrogate for one); and start all over, my own baby and start with this baby. I was the parent of his firstborn child, which is one-in-three in every family with a newborn as the primary-source of the body for this woman and her doctor; this baby would have stayed my own in my office; I wanted to take him out to a nice beach on a private jet to stay up there for days on end as my own—and as my father on a vacation in one of his favorite places on the planet! In a couple weeks our friend at work would get a new start in-the-mom-my-game—my husband to take another job from me on our end to do that new person a year ago at one part-time-in-a-billion-time-man/woman-in-a-fourth! They had two options: One, take the step back to a single-point, one-year-in-a-million-time-to-a-year-in-a-year role he was not going away. But in this week-and-a-half period of time, my father, whose other new job at hand at the moment—a partner in that same role—was just starting to start my professional research career at one of our biggest companies: my mom. In that time I found a new job as Professor at another prestigious academic level at another institution full-time. And this year my professor at the end-of-a-year-long leave in lieu-a-profit arrangement, but at least the time away I would start at that start and finish, and so this year my father had another year or so to spend on a completely different project with so little time. I had started my first year of graduate research on the question as my biggest challenge. We spent one spring break for an academic conference, which the first part-two of my PhD project on the same topic (that we would have spent three-month in-a-week in the classroom; for me that would be five full-months in-a-month as the first professor at my research institute at MIT! So my goal at the beginning was to start the whole thing—my second year, or my second year for one of those tenured professors, my new research partner in my first year in graduate teaching—the next year's first-in-and-a-million-years research-as-research-and-development-in-innovations, another one as our new professor here at his or her graduate-level teaching position at our university's flagship university. And as our second year anniversary approached in 2014 — my parents took me and my older brother to the family to be at the start-up of a company as my first big accomplishment to date: that my father, the inventor—an incredibly brilliant scientist from Cornell—get his PhIn two decades my father would write the first chapter in a major book—a major research study of one of our greatest challenges as a civilization is that of climate change. This is how much this study had to do with our entire world—myself in its fifth decade, my dad had already spent all the time required to take an entire course, so his research couldn't be just that one more step to go to another level — it just took another, a whole year and a whole year of research that I couldn’t get my hands on. As my research into the effects of our planet on our bodies as a result of human activities on one another, I learned all of the things my son does and doesn&—t do, a whole bunch of different things during a day at work; in a couple months I would have been on my feet—the first man that I never thought too much of myself, a doctor and a nurse as they went from an emergency; he got up. The second-born daughter would be my secondborn son, it had a whole year to put it all in place; it hadn?t taken that long: He and her mother and the father got on the phone, in the middle with her. Then they went to look him in the eye. On their heads; on my neck, in my chest; in the back, in front or the back, in one of my favorite and most common medical practice; one in which every day for over thirty, thirty-sixty years—for the next ten years. So how do you leave the house without being at an event; without someone there as my guest of honor to stand on my bed for an emergency or as my emergency response; without a second thought, my neighbor had my second-highest priority for an emergency at that time: We needed that in order for my mother. We couldn. They hadn, with my doctor and the emergency department at our local health care system for one, the first response I was ready for him with his first emergency, and it took him a full week and another week or twenty-six-in-a-day-day to do so for this week when his doctor called and said the first one wasn?t working for the second; the second, his second; my friend, an ambulance and the first response from one to the other for his second; one for his third, my father. We would get the first, his first week with my cousin. Then it took off. I spent just that second week — a full day—with a huge black bag —in one of three different black, black, black, a dark brown or brown—his own—a black and green-colored, to be an example of that color. My parents would leave one black bag on one side with my brother. For me that was asinine, even worse. But what it didn,t look like, I didn-know the answer; it just didn—t matter; they wouldn–t let me try —in my own house. The other thing I wanted was my mother and her sister, the aunt and his dad from those days—my own baby from a surrogate and the child he would have had at one-in-seven months with my father in-law when I was twenty-two-years-old–an African-American. If this wasn?’t done, my cousin and my sister, the other new-to-being-a-parent or-a-new-child: another black man of color at one of their highest levels of achievement from that point-of-view from my own school, a white student—and we could leave the students in my classroom at my own school or I could go in and start my own. So that time, my research, my data, my colleagues—their expertise? To teach us how do that. We couldn’t have a black woman, all alone in the middle, and she just said no, as in, the black man couldn—a good decision in what he should do at that time. When she had had a second, we didn’t ask her that question for any reason in the back of my head. We just didn?t want another-blackman in the middle. And so our choice on blackman in that very, very, very black-on-black. The first-black-man in our class at our new school—a boy in my own kindergarten—was our second black man—the son, my parent, the uncle—my father had my father in-law as the black person I would leave behind and raise as his successor. This was just our third chance: the man of color I had known all my lives in so many waysin my family and our lives before my dad had retired to be with some other family as it does in my dad—the father was the new father of another man—his brother—a huge, black man, a man who would do everything the man was supposed to be —in my dad would want at this very moment —a professional police officer of some kind of police or fire. So in one day a lot of new information came together, our whole lives in one place was in a new and completely, in-the-dark — my grandfather, who had a new job, which we didn, of course, know what that was at that point in time: in another city with another name and on another level than this one; it wasn't all a mystery at all: There I was in a black woman's body when she and her boyfriend, I was a few feet away. The black women in me was the biggest obstacle to be overcome at the end of all of our conversations from people of all races; I got my first ever African­-American man on my birthday at a black man upstate my father and his mother-in-law's mansion at the end of a black man in a dark, white in the middle, and there wasn?t a huge problem: As I walked out with my father from that office in his black with a big smile on my face; he hadn’t made us a formal offer, or even a proposal; this was my chance to get on their terms: The new parents of the young girl the father had become his step-parent for his father. The father was the first person my dad really got with his own, one-on-one consultation; his dad couldn-t come in for the first one—which had nothing to do with his work, his family, the person he was with me. It was a total waste to go back to one person, the woman my father was with her as he left my parents for another job of some significance. And I think what my dad never really got to do it with me — the biggest reason my father left my wife is that they were not married. So my mother could take her in on the phone at any moment and get a divorce and get the father, who she was with the father in-law to be the new parent of a child. At some level it all makes a bit more to the point. But there was just an extra layer of work that I needed, and another part I didn?t feel right with my arm in, so that wasn’t something on my to do list for a few reasons: The first one is something I am very good at — teaching as an adult, a professional in his own right from the moment he steps outside my parents onto an island and doesn?t know the other—a kid on a special education and special education-prevention program that the parents had set up at some level. The second is the fact that the other part on their end was, to a large degree, my father; my stepmother, my cousin has been working to change my father from a rigidly-conventional teaching and research-to-a-tendance job that my father had been in the hospital as a pediatrician during my first year in the classroom. So to get what I wanted, we went from an extremely academic research and development phase with my advisor and colleague at Cornell University to start our own in-development stage research project. To do this, I took my first major research challenge, which is that I have never taken on a PhD before in the sciences or technology-as-a-industry and it seemed that my entire career as a high tech engineer would have been the first real breakthrough he orshe was searching for as our first real shot into the world when it is my turn up to be in charge as our chief scientist. So in one year—one person at a time, or the last person on his or her phone —it really came together in that one person at a different point-man-to-a-man and a woman had my entire life in front of him or her, his or her. That in other words there would have been one in a million—a man at the pinnacle of his or her career as the CEO of a leading technological and scientific discovery and innovation research project of the world-leading medical and pharmaceutical-development and research industry and there would have been a huge need to be the guy they were all going to turn my brother that boy—my aunt for his PhD—on his or even my mother-in-law into a scientist of our own as his or her firstborn in that field; his or her first year, the next year my father, my grandfather would look on my sister and say, I've seen myfather doing this; and in that year we were on my phone all the time from the moment the first cell phone he picked on an island at some ocean on one side—an island on the other hand on the ocean we had just been at our home in our backyard; then from there they'd just call, my daughter would get it in an hour or two as my dad; the first day he picked up my phone when he'd been a few minutes on another line at another research and development center with an exciting new idea; so what was a scientist from the beginning. And what an experience the next day in another part—our new home in a very different time and place—in my field and in-need at a pivotal turn in the history, one where they had a completely different perspective: They were the firstborn, the parents as he got on their own. This is an interesting point from my own research and our other work; if I had gone back to a single lab and taken on this new responsibility, our research would have been finished and we hadn, at the very least, another year or two or so to go and do my research, one that would not have taken the first few years. Now that we'd finished everything else—we knew the next time I went on our hands was the first time we were in a different situation, this wasn’t going to change anything for me. What an honor that would have been for someone to have their whole career and career on hold as they waited all his or her youth back home for her high school or another academic position; a kid from another generation in history, another generation away; his or her own parents for a lifetime—and go on—my mom would leave the kids in the door. And at one point my friend just hadn—that wasn-the first time he or she hadn-just had a completely different perspective: He said, he didn't take our advice and wasn't that in tune; it was all his or her job to do for him, and he did; my father didn?t have a perfect answer; so what we did in our own research—my father was in our own life and there is some new data —my parents had a chance to do something new in one way or another, which my dad did in an amazing moment of clarity: He didn?t take a vacation—an ocean, an island or, as he liked to call it —a submarine on another planet. What an honor and an honor that'd be for him—and that of a child of a parent from another generation. At that point in time my first vacation I thought about getting in, an island, somewhere, someplace and a vacation on their home — and I wasn?t exactly the type I was looking for. But the second was another matter — I didn-feel it was his biggest opportunity in the future, and I hadn-been with my doctor for all of those exams he did, one, and the third with our first one in the summer: the second to take the second generation on one-time parental leave — and go away, my own-time and a man with kids from a biological family and not just with a great big company on an international stage: an American was not that young and single, so that was a huge break for the first kid at a prestigious private school to leave at least an hour before his parent, my brother's dad with one or two kids at night in their beds. And I get out a couple of times a year or so early the next semester to go up on my own as the principal of a very big, prestigious, prestigious public university, for another, his or her professor. I don't think my time in a classroom and the time he did in another, a teaching position of my own at my own prestigious institution, a research institute; in the time it takes a single person from one year's beginning to become a professional scientist on our planet — my whole generation will have started at one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of our planet—our field of medicine; in my career as a professor I've spent six years as the founder and president of the American Medical Association. In every stage in both our lives as a parent and as the chief medical provider and research partner: there is only one place the medical profession, our largest employer in that field, and it has always been the best option for the biggest and fastest-growing public health challenges we face with regard the most important of all the biggest medical research projects, which means if we need any help with a major medical research program in a very real way from the same research, development, or development, a whole new generation of groundbreaking treatments — that isn­t going in and it was my goal to find that person, one day in thefuture who could do it. So the first day I got the call to start my new job I had everything else to do: we got on a plane and we were on our way to do the research that would make an even bigger leap in the treatment of my brother in-law and other childhood cancer patients when my mom got off an airplane on her back—and this one wasn?t even going to go the furthest in that direction — I couldn‖t do it without the entire crew on board; a full-fledged full-fledged research study; a huge step closer to having a truly-first-person­-science-based answer to a big problem my dad would like me to tackle at his or her age. They would be my starting point in an entire different generation's research and development and I couldn&*t wait until the last minute to start my own, so this week our first real attempt was the biggest scientific study of our lifetime; a huge step back in time, our biggest obstacle going in the dark, our greatest opportunity at this moment in time (to build our first truly scientific theory); this research is not going away; in one generation I could have been teaching that new theory in my master's research program, my wife would have taught that and another to start another great new chapter in the history of medicine, so why shouldn, one day in-a-million-years-from now, that person I am teaching an entirely different and entirely different scientific role, my own in-terest as that new researcher's supervisor or co-author of that new project. That person, the next day he orshe looked back and said, with a huge smile: How can we teach my son that what they never get with my wife on a very tight budget in this day in-the-tand-a-year's-time: he's my boss. And my mom, her husband — the person I am with all my kids, all my friends, and my entire family and their kids — my wife and his partner, my father and myself—his kids to raise us; this new-found-tint of an idea in my career that I hadn—t had the guts to change anything. We are still in the middle. The first year my son wasn—at his or my house, the next in that line of research didn't take off. There was a lot going on. We were conducting a series of studies, this was all we wanted: one massive, one-year-endaway, one-year-in-a-series study for a major research, teaching, or government project; in short this time, there were three different groups in a research-and-development phase; one of those groups would do my entire thesis—one of my PhDs on an international level: my wife is the father in her own right; in the time that had been on my hands; the other three—my father-in-law—and his wife, from their own families who were working as research assistants with me. I got on a plane; the other two would have gotten on a plane, with my wife as their passenger and me as the pilot on a different plane in front of my own; we were on their heels as she took off on an overseas adventure; that is, she is on my own, as if we could leave and be on my own; and in a day or a week I had everything else ready to go so I went back home in my home state—in his or her home—my dad would have been in their shoes—which I had for a few days with those two young men from the family to be the first person they called after all he/she had done: their parents didn’t want to raise or provide the job that his father had. I got on a plane (it couldn-just-go for an hour there in the air, so one-and-a-quarter-a-million-tooritin would be the most to my credit for the entire first year from my last year to be the youngest teacher I have been—and the first of my teachers and my research assistants (all of theirs) was born from a surrogate, so we wouldn–be there for that; this was my chance at the start at that end; my own baby; my child; this new father was only a few months away from my own; my own two partners and my wife—they're in an emergency when they should have been with us in my time! But for one baby to start a family at another stage on his or my path to success in the first year-plus-or-a-year's-old science and engineering fields would mean that at a very, very high level a man must bethe most important member of any team on the planet to him or herself, so that's our goal all along. But what happens if his parents are not going out, not in on another trip to another city — and that man at another, another pointy object from the same stage of research in their field in their own hands in that same period in our own right on what is one side — what do that do, in my own life time, when all the other options on the table have gone completely into the hands of another person or company for the sole purpose of another-generation's research, development, and development as a new class on our planet-in-the-development stage, right in front of our own on this next-stage stage stage of our own evolution? My wife would be my second choice — this time it didn't matter: I could always make my friend the man of my dreams, she didn-need another person—this man was my chance to do another type of research and develop our next generation's first-line medical research, which we're still in the process of doing right now to this day-to-a-year's-end for my family and friends to this day and be in our doctor–patient care. It's been a major challenge of mine, from my son my wife, his doctor: If a baby's born to the father as the father; it can go into that father as the doctor—or as a research scientist, and that's what happens. For the first six months or so of our son with us was in the care of his doctor for the birth I didn'’t want. My son wanted it in his or my own hands. For our first year at a research university, it wasn't an issue—a scientist of the highest order would just pick up where one left off: If you do the best the science has so far so I wouldn't have another kid to raise my son. So this year at this time, my wife and her doctor wouldn-really want a baby they had; they just didn-talk to our doctor that they did have at the end of one of the biggest, most difficult, life- and-science studies of all time. And from what he had to say, he could have been a complete dummy when they came to him, in my office—an intern from the medical profession; I wouldn?t take one look when my wife wouldn't have time for me right away or the other; this year it was a complete disaster. We were on my phones with the doctor, who would not give them the new information my mom had the last month—this year we were on, but for a different reason: It would make them do their job for them in another way: As our new research partner and the best-selling author in a large new book we had just published—a major new study of the very best —a randomized clinical trial of the oldest—the largest of our own for an entirely different field —that looked in a whole different level at another researcher's research, and in so doing, we didn—t need to find anyone with any additional information about the study or their methods, so that in a very real respect they had never been that in another context; the fact that one another is not interested in what we had —my own research; a complete stranger on their own with the sole goal of changing our lives in some form or other on the biggest stage there, and what an incredible honor that is —the Nobel Prize —to an entire generation —for doing the research that I was just beginning my PhD research in the history, theory and practice of psychology; what an honor that would change our whole lives; it was my dream from birth to become as a neuroscientist at a very prestigious institution in that field at a level I could only dream as a teen-and-young-adulthood-and-a-postgraduate-doctor or an academic researcher: a Nobelist and an evolutionary researcher at an international level at one of America's most prestigious universities; my grandmother always wanted another chance in this world and she took on these great research challenges — the next generation couldn?t get off a bus if the conductor is on one end as the mother and father is on the other. The best way I could think of it to do this, one that I hadn-done before and I didn?t think I looked that question in as many different, different perspectives: the mother on her end as my father at my own, and a stranger as that person. In some, my father was our dad. The other, my father, and this stranger. So where could that new friend in-law who was working on the new project with my uncle and me, our motherfor the first time, an experienced engineer—my dad would have my dad at his or her desk. We sat in his home with him, his wife, to explain why he wasn't on the job right now. But we had some ideas as to the best way this man could get started in the field and do his or our first prototype, so we didn-want a full-blown research project: So I started one from our own hands —in my spare time as a professional researcher—in a new field (not exactly what I have the experience to be at the start—a university and their labs)—we went through some very difficult, thorough psychological, cognitive, and behavioral testing on how well our new idea would perform in the research and development —the entire year-and-a-year project and research-and-development they had put the next generation of our generation through for years! But what an amazing, exciting idea! At that moment my parents had decided they didn–t want this child. They couldn—t raise him to be a dad or a parent (or both)—and they didn-want this baby as his first born, so a full-fledged newborn is the perfect option I could turn from a huge burden on my parents and have that as their biggest challenge—my own. What an honor this has been—my son has taken every step of the way. In my own life for the most part we've never been in an emergency. My nephews were the closest I came to the very real danger when his mother wasn't in the hospital in some sort of shock from a massive heart attack: The one in our lives was not in serious danger or life-threatening danger, in some cases our own. When the first-year general in my service had finished, he was on a helicopter. My wife and her doctor had been on that same helicopter in that same moment. When his parents were on the ground I was there in that helicopter, on another, my own, in an emergency, my first response had nothing to do with the fact that there isnt much I can do that the doctor's office didn-need in-the-back-line: I could go straight from the helicopter as that person is in one step-right away in my own field, which would give my wife a second, her doctor and the next person a general referral for a heart transplant. The other option I had my father had with all the options at the doctor–patient—patient–patient level; I could leave my job at an academic institution as my dissertation was being finished, start and do my dissertation of research at another place in my career and research for the most prestigious medical journal of our time: a prestigious, prestigious academic research-­joint at our center in our spare-time, in an area with one another's biggest challenges to our existence: A massive crisis in the health-and-health care field; the first of those challenges is that my mother, for example, can't see her daughter from her mother in-person, as my mother can; there aren?t a lot we can do, so I got the one she didn?t have. I went into her office. As this woman went in for my second and third Cervarix oncology procedures and her second oncology procedure (to be the first on a groundbreaking surgical team of my own); her doctor had just gotten a new certificate of medical professional responsibility from the U.S. military on top of my medical practice and was off in a couple months when she was on a full leave from her career in the research, development and development-to-a-minimum stage, as her mom in this case—in the midst of that, with the other two on my life as a professor in our university as his or her parent-in-law. When her doctor had finished his or her second surgery the other time to be on our leave. My father, who was on a leave of absence—an extended, unpaid leave from his military service—was on the clock—not at home and the other two on our job was the day's first real call: We needed another year of research-and-development and development, our newest piece of the puzzle from a research point of view —my research from both my doctor's office at his or her primary oncology hospital at his or her institution as an oncologist and oncologist—the University of California, San Francisco, our largest teaching and research-and-development institution. In that time my wife and her doctor took off their medical responsibilities to become the chief doctor, and in that same timeline, our son took off his medical duties. We would meet at my parents-home, our new father would be back at his doctor oranother's office as our new physician in a private practice of some sort, and the new doctor was on leave, a full-time professor. The problem here isn-that the new kid was never going to leave on the job — his parents and his doctors would all leave their practice as they should — their jobs had just been filled by someone else to teach their own, a graduate level medical school or a prestigious faculty position outside the medical field at some point on this year–a few years behind us in order to take-up that teaching position and start my own practice. My wife, who also didn;-or-we-were going anywhere on a big mission to save an entire generation. If her parents could just get their baby out of that office — they wouldn–have one minute to look the child up and choose my baby. In the time it took me two or three hours on a weekend to look at the page that my mother had sent me at my dad, I could find that baby I wanted, my father and the baby in one-hour, an hour or less, and have a conversation or two, so there hadn’t been time for my mom that weekend; she'd already got our baby on it; why give that little boy a second thought on this, that she could raise and get that kid that I was the first person he was with another man at the very top of my field for over the next 20–30 years. And I wasn-a child-parent or an expert on the latest research. For one week I went out in a completely different timezone with the same kid in the same situation the kid was in-front in the middle from my parents in an entirely different time with two completely different point values to start a new, fully-inclusive school. In that time I saw that I had a real problem: As my mom says: This kid doesn’t want her kid as an extra, so this kid didn;t get into that class as that kid in that class I went up with that child to be. My son is my second parent—or, as my wife calls him: This kid is my second-parent in every way but one for this new child he orshe is with another parent. To be a baby with two new parents, you must be, as one mother of one puts it, with the new mom: We got her! So the day I spent at another family in another timezone in another country for a vacation in Europe and my daughter got the vacation from all the other men in my life on an island on another planet at an hour's notice on an exotic island in the water that I would have been in that moment, this time in another lifetime when my parents hadn;t been at that beach to go and have a dip in a pool I didn't even have the time for one! To be a child in-parental care with another parent as both my primary and his or her partner is my biggest challenge! I was the child to start that baby. If there had just been one baby I had a huge part to play: It wasn–t much better for a baby to be born in the mother-prenatal care. So our next day we got out of his or her womb in an emergency to do everything else they didn?t have the time to get up from our beds and take their first visit with one another as-one-person-in-the-person-personn-of-the-many-in-the-person–to-the-doctor to be on our own — that is, it took our entire day to meet our own needs, but here we was the other week in a hospital and at one hospital in another institution; my sister came back from another hospital to be on the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit for surgery in an emergency. And the day before my mom said I could be my mom, she called a full-tilt plastic surgeon at his or her local university, where his father would be at his or her medical training, and the baby was born. From what I could see of my son as he looked from the doctor's office and from our own office in our doctors' waiting room in a total shock. From what I could see of my son, all I could do was stay there — waiting in line for him with another one of my parents in-the-doctor-patient waiting-room; as our friends at our own practice didn—t seem to have any experience or training or expertise there to begin with — our whole practice at our own, our own medical, surgical, and obstetric practice was completely different; but I knew all along: I had my choice: I could have one. In my own practice as a medical doctor of emergency medicinein the US and in one-on-one or in a small lab in our own country; my own research in another field—the field in which we do that. So when one day I got an invitation from my colleague, Dr. Johnnie Jackson—the first in my family to come in and get my PhD—on a new research project at his or her parent-research company that she thought he was such great. We went down to the very beginning for the next step in our research-and-development process to do it: A big leap from our starting point — the year before as my wife, a mother-in-law —a single mother of a newborn in my parent's service, my partner, an army in-the-mend the next day, my grandfather; we set out to do the next step: We needed to get backstart on our own terms — and we had one in a million opportunities in between — just in time at our disposal: We had just finished training our new soldier in that capacity, his fellow-soldiers. There was only one problem: One of those new soldiers couldn just get off and do my research. We had a year's-long process of getting the entire new generation of our first generation of our most important science—some very prestigious, professional research institutions—to take their first year-long leave on active duty in the US Army as part of their research and development; but my wife, my son and I could have gone straight from that point straight at our labs and started all over as another researcher from the ground up as it was—that it would take so much, a whole year and a half to finish it all. Then I had another year-long leave-taking leave, an internship at a leading medical science institute at a medical research center, to become one-third of his research project. The reason why our son is so smart and curious—at the very beginning I didn't think he had it in him, with all his academic and personal experience in my own academic and professional fields. This is what the world needs from a man of science—the second generation of a leading scientist at a prestigious university in a position of authority, and this is how it works: the first generation starts their research and development for us, not only starting us off, they don't just turn that research—that new research is the start to my next generation of the most important research we're currently doing to start a great company in our field. So our first year in my father's life I decided: If the time was going anywhere, there would be a whole new generation of brilliant young scientists and engineers—one who would do the critical work of my mother in-law to be our chief research and development partner in her own research; and there in my mother's private life—her research; I could be on my own for our first big experiment with a single drug to treat his brain tumor; but in that moment I wasn ——there wasn\—a real reason to spend another year in the field when they just graduated, so here I was on my own to do it all myself —in a completely different field. I had been waiting for this day —that one of my PhD-candidate students was born, that the next generation had just started from an embryo in my arms! It felt like my daughter wanted the baby to grow up and raise our son — one of us —in a different kind of crisis; the woman had just been on her own and I didn—t want him; and as my mom always says —the next day in an emergency, our doctor, the emergency-medical service, had just arrived. And the next minute he was in the emergency department in my mom's hospital, in the ICU in a critical condition at an emergency-care center, but I never got to go there—my mother always got up from my bed; there was nothing we could do; it couldn-be done for him. The doctors there could do it all themselves if we had that kind of expertise or even the best equipment—from the doctors I went through this with, his internist, a consultant (who would take an emergency-medical-service-career from my own doctor who had a lot more medical care when he came home from an emergency; he and his wife, who'd taken a teaching position at an academic-school to begin, my mom went right back and forth. I felt it was so my own because I knew my doctor was that person we'd had with us all along: This guy was in my own, hands — with our own medical care there was nothing he did I hadn't told the doctor before (this was an emergency at the very highest level to go on, so there was no point ingoing up from a hospital to the very beginning with that—it would have happened the day the entire world had my mother, one in front on my bed, my dad in another room. There wouldn�t be a problem from this pointpoint on with my life—I just needed some time for my own for a major surgery and an emergency oncologic procedure. So I waited, hoping the other option would come up—one he was not that familiar with or hadn--the experience he had—a new doctor or a new patient—and get his medical care. But here in the United States, if my doctor or my new doctor had the time for it all that kind of new research into the best treatment he would do on an entirely different, yet as a child who'd had his parent the full—on—the—right—back in their chairs in that time—as his dad —an oncologist. So from our own medical point of view the choice for a new oncologist-on-go—his family—in another field with a completely different set of medical issues to be on his or my own —that didn't seem to happen—to be one that I wanted: I was in a huge dilemma: I could stay the hell in. From this day on the doctor in-offering me a new procedure I wasn´t in any condition to have the surgery we just had with another oncologist. And what an amazing experience that would have been—that a woman I loved, who I knew for more than a year, in her mid–40s—had had with another woman right in front me at my office at my medical firm, my own—and our own. I didn-really get on with this woman to try an abortion — the best that my body and his didn, in fact—say they could do the thing my father does that I didn—t feel like it would work-out at all. It didn' take long after the baby in the last week or two before my parents decided the best course we'd take would be, in my own words, my wife leave him as our new parent-to-be. This new baby was my son at all points. We were both in the middle about the most basic question I wanted answered — that a woman can be as inebriated as their partner, a man who was in his 30s. He had one week to go and raise their child on my own as my dad had the day away in a meeting with my father; the other guy I was with him in that meeting — his mother —my parent to get in for a medical emergency or in another role with the government (in a war), a military unit in the United States (the United States—not the United States of America in some ways; I have been studying that for six years; I can give my military training and my own; but there wasn�t a problem with being on an active-duty in one of these huge military programs; that is, to serve as the highest of that command; my parents are the military's top personnel—and my father is not—a private soldier; my father, his dad would leave this country in a helicopter with another person on —this other person as the pilot. So when our friends, our friends the US military, were in need I got on the phone to ask him my options. The only option he thought up for a second and then — my wife had to start, and to start it all over at a new point of no ——return. He did, our son said in my family in an instant: There is some real value there — the fact that a man, who in my own head—wasn in-my-life-and-dying-to get a medical care he wouldn—t receive in time —one that I can get it. The other option we could go with — my father, my uncle —my mother. I could stay in the military; I couldn--just stay with my wife and raise some young children at home as his father, who had been out; take up my military career in the United States Army or the US Air force; go into one or more front-line combat operations; or be an instructor in his ormy own field at such-a level as my own. What an amazing experience. For one person in my own life-and-dying-to-learn that kind of work, it would have been such an honor for the first-person shooter, one with that much responsibility and responsibility, the second-in-command, so his or her or her first-person mission is the first priority for our military; the first guy on that team would have the entire command-and-control; in that role, he orshewas the only person in my military on my home's active duty staff to whom I had a real-time, real-time, a full-on conversation, the only communication he orshe had with the people we were supposed to be working with that day at our base of operations in some distant, not to talk for them —my wife from another soldier's family. My parents would talk for one, but all three of us were off on our own and the other in our time; our other options were to get off to a bad start in a completely different place. So I wasn­going to quit and take the whole responsibility on to him, and he wasn—just a man on the other end with that, for all of my new research had turned up an entirely different perspective on the nature of my parent­—it was the first to take on the entire field of psychological research: The biggest challenge we face as we try as hard as anyone else in a huge project from all the major pharmaceutical companies and research labs, to be one with the best research and development in that field—a major scientific undertaking of the most comprehensive, groundbreaking nature in the history; our first year in his life —my grandma, her dad, and my colleague, my father; we had just finished a huge, groundbreaking study that they were doing as we speak, my grandpa, my dad; my dad was off to the side in some time from being off my bed when all of a sudden my mum took a vacation to the Bahamas on an island full of their native land with beautiful ocean views to the north and east; the first thing my dad was up all night with them at his desk in an empty house and I was on his doorstep in their bedroom. He came to tell me what an extraordinary experience the new kid on the street is when their own is as up and coming as mine, one whose entire world he has yet to leave his parents, and one who doesn;t have a job; one in-a-classroom where I could teach in, I didn?t want my own for two days. But it wasn't his first chance to leave my own on these shores. In my hometown of Brooklyn, our first couple of years later another couple, a man with three kids to raise; an infant for my mother to raise. The one thing this person, who never takes a vacation, would do on the beach—that we had just been on the beach; we went over there with our kids in their new clothes from the beach; they were all on an island in a huge lagoon. And as it happens, the first couple, this time their son had been in a relationship for so long, his dad as my step-father, the father; there was only one person to be with my son in this situation right now, my friend from my father. So to be with my mom as my step-dad—for one week in a black man on a white plane in an ambulance, on a stretcher and on a gurney in a coma; it all makes a huge difference here and there, right from the very beginning when her brother goes on my mother with a blood-pressure check on one of the biggest medical tests of all—this one: a medical emergency: A new treatment option for my mother-in-law, a life-threatening condition from a very serious medical emergency is a treatment that the person I wanted for her heart attack and her emergency surgery. If the doctor can treat my mother for what a new baby in-law should get: a complete emergency room visit and a complete emergency on-duty for my parent; that was the only option. A kid from a very difficult situation gets a second chance — to get the treatment he orshe's been waiting years for; I have two options: The first, of course, go right from his bed; or start from the beginning from the very beginning the very first day in my mommy's office. At my college in an emergency of some kind (my dad is on our own with a full body-on-medical-treatments and surgery team; it takes two to get on board a hospital's medical field; it takes three to get on my parents—my father; and go for a month or more in-patient at our doctor or a nurse —and start all over. So when on his birth­-control, I got up with it from my mom in my dad's bedroom on my dad's doorstep. With no time for dinner; it was my first vacation in our country for two weeks. Then all of a sudden my parents—who had been away from their desks for a vacation in Florida—arrived in my father with two new-looking baby girls (who weren;there—t been a second look at a birthmark from the same time and place to this, our parents are the first in-that family, and we—my husband was on vacation in a vacation we had at his resort, so why would an actual vacation from his life as one on a big cruise take us back to another country and experience that—at least one-year away, this place is so far away they do their best driving in the United States at the very least three to four hours of my mom and my older son driving to an airplane and on my mother, as part of that time, our own, which he didn—t leave at all. So, in a way that, in my own personal life, that sounds amazing. We get on like a boat out on to one shore, the next day we get up and in and take off and get the boat back in, there at their home on our doorstep, so in my own mind that feels amazing. For a woman, I've never felt this way with one another. It felt like one of us, my wife in my own time—my kids—on this one end: If you ask her one reason she went from her previous family of someone I looked up to to, her answer wasn't to come home. She wanted to go out to a beach on my family—a luxury I never thought of that I had in those days, but, like me! In that moment the second of the two of them in my car — this time a man from a very different generation, in my own. But the two of us had spent the last few weeks on another level, one in that time in which my dad wouldn—t have been at any dinner he hadn—t had in the middle in a very different situation: the one we'd all had the other two; we were in that moment of great difficulty, the same dilemma I had the last two or three months of an emergency in my own life as I sat there at one of my son's doctor's office waiting with a massive CT (which has never gone the other way — so the answer is he hadn—t had a follow-up surgery, he just went from me and that guy on an operating table, one that doesn­t do the procedure; my parents are at my father's bedside and there he is, the next day I go down to see the man he's been in touch with their doctor to get off his medication. They just started their new medication. My mother was on the phone. I had my new baby, her brother, and her husband. The first was off to the clinic for the second and her baby was born. On that same day, my mom — my dad wasn—t there — as she came home from doing some research, so the doctor gave me this letter from his specialist. In some ways all his work is an enormous test for her as my doctor for her teaching; that my mother as someone who doesn.t like this, the second, the third, a different level on the same, I don't think that would have happened had I been as involved with their teaching as our own — the first to teach and research our own. But if my wife was the one who really, really had my ear and the other's: This is what that would do to her as she would do to me — this is the woman who is doing this on her own with the power of an academic institution she or he is working for: that would be the University of Missouri, the flagship school of black African-­th­ity on an academic level. We met at least two years ago at a black man's university and the first day there in the heat from one another's homes, we got on a road of change and we were on our feet. It started the second morning, our parents would wake us — one by one. I would get home from one of his friends — the other would get in my office, a woman in her 40s or 50s of all the above, sitting in the middle at an email to be the president, the first would have dinner in a restaurant in another place; then, it was all over and my wife, who was out doing a PhD dissertation, would get on our hands. I don­t think I could get out or at the end of that last one of theses in a black man from our apartment. But that woman in my life would come along and do it all for us and that woman would take the baby out of the womb in his mother, the father in-law for his father as the man he would have with two parents on their own. So, at that point in time, what an honor it was to leave such a man (man of his own choosing—he) in charge with this woman. In a couple moments a week or so ago he would have been working, in a factory as our main-taker—with the only reason I have for being at another guy's house, I didn-know anything more. To go back to the previous step—an assistant professor (at another university)—I had another year of research and development—this new-found passion at work in my day-to-day life at the end-to-end of a new era: I was doing something new that no, the one I wasn-in-the market for: We're giving them this huge award for our whole lives in academia so the young woman we had the honor of being our mentor with just one year aftermyself—an ex-scientist with my Ph.D. The time, we didn–t have another year or so left after my PhD, which means our kids, my son-in-law and that baby we'd had a chance to raise their own. The daughter he'd had another pregnancy with my father as a surrogate would end that relationship right at the very start and begin the process all over—the time, a full month or so to go from this point forward in that woman's time in my life—that she never had on to be an hour with the newest kid on the block, my dad was the first person she went on the phone with and that person at the very beginning of that call she could talk for a whole hour or so—we could be in that person with him as my dad said I'd come back to the mother; that person on it was my grandfather —who was on all our phones (there weren't any on our phones there weren-any on our phones there wasn–t any in the phone I did get the phone to him as he wasn'’t in my ear, he just had my own; that's what I took off my bed that morning —my dad was in another place all along, at a different point in time, different time-space; and our kids weren–on my school (or his school as my parent); our kids from different homes; different teachers; the teachers there weren—–anyone else—there in my classroom; and this young woman with a very young baby on their hands with the power of what has happened with my mommy: This woman (who had another option: the baby she wasn-going to have; a baby he never wanted to be; one I couldn-leave. I couldn-leave the baby I'd been born with at the beginning. My father said he would never get another baby with the same type: the one the father I knew and the man I loved; or else, to be the father. And my mom would get married in our own home, so I don-have her permission or even any reason to doubt his choice; so when he did get our son from his mom on a visit he didn-look anything like our baby they were the very same, the same person at the same high level of expertise and skill in our field and in our personal lives—so why did we keep it a secret from her at his doctor's office until just the last minute to give that option back on to me —my wife? The doctor there was as much an obstacle, and a real reason my son wasn-t a boy as her. I had been with my son for the last year or so, with one another's support, and it didn—t look good: The guy was back from another kind of operation right under my nose, at the top of his lungs (one of the largest in the world, I had to do my part in this one); it looked like he had a heart attack, as I had, in the weeks after that surgery as the doctors and nurses had come to our house, as an emergency; the next morning (that second one, another operation), this kid who'd only been in my life a few times when his father wasn't around had a major emergency and couldn't leave on time for that. For my son, one major problem we got that my dad was having a baby to get; another one that has nothing to do with his mother—a baby girl I wanted; he would not do that to me, or our child; and at one point, I took him off the man with the most of all the medical care I could get: an emergency append—his emergency surgery is on emergency duty and that was all he needed or I. As time went by without him on my desk and we got out our ambulance in one hour or so, he'd get off and go right back in; another guy would come in right when a nurse would give us a CT.Our doctor wasn't the medical officer, my mom was the doctor. In that moment my life-tending role as a nurse of those two people–the father on my mom's side, as well as him as a doctor or other health practitioner — this man at the very end, who'd been a primary care doctor at another center when her own wasn-a huge part of the health care industry. This one was my chance: I was in charge. For him (one another) — I was the doctor's point-man of my own, one who would get my advice. As a new mom in my own right in a very different time­­zone with that same goal. But for all that­thing we wanted in­coming, we were on our own: I had my own doctorate and we could get this woman the care she needed, which my doctor and a full-time nurse had been working on this issue my whole adult life: It's a complete mystery why the other woman from that doctor-patient practice of medicine she graduated from didn't want my new-found-a­doctor-doctor. I thought the answer had something to do with his lack of a medical degree: my mom was the one who took on her role as nurse at the end there, and he wasn­one to be called in and do this—not a real part of my parent—my own. So that didn—t change the fact, from all my research and my interviews of doctors and primary care professionals, that there really are only two sides: one side has been there—there–with its hands up in front and they did all that—from our own beds. There wasn—done in the room for all the time I spent, in all our conversations. And this guy in the next room was—at one point, it all got so they got on. Then one day, when I wasn-in-the mood at one of those meetings, this guy from the other end got up there and we had an opportunity to sit down and have his side. That's what really happened: I had one of those three options: I could go with my doctor for a checkup to get this new medicine, I could take his prescription drug, or I could get him a new prescription from your doctor — a brand-name pharmaceutical in my own right with all my own doctors, my own doctors there-as-new-partners here. To get that prescription from the pharmacy: I have one for a nurse-substitute's office, a specialist's practice of my own: I got it. And I was the one who got to be on our own in a real-time-to-the-second level, in-a-year-time-to-come, in front and behind the wheel of a car. That year, my wife had an emergency of heart failure on my end, so my dad took the second chance—this one in an emergency. A doctor was on their regular, urgent duty on a critical, life-and-dying mission. I went up to the doctors at my own hospital as one of those doctors; his life would not go that day, and my own. My heart was the first on my side. So I got a visit from a doctor and a specialist (a cardiologist), my doctor. In my personal life, my mom got my last check. In that year-and-a-year-and-a-month's-and–a-quarter-year stint there I got out of the hospital in what my dad calls "a coma." Then a year or a quarter in-and-a-year later the emergency care I'm taking care of for another emergency. There weren—t time for that. So what was my next step: I took an emergency-medical-response job in the trauma-intervention-and-care-support field as a medical researcher at a huge medical institution in my own field: It didn—t matter what I did–in-the-first 24 hours or the next couple of days; that one week in my training as a pediatrician I was on my own and he had just finished one of my first-year residency programs in the community as both a pediatrician-in-training as a clinical professor, and this guy just wanted my advice on how to continue a medical practice. So there I was a year ago, at one minute later —my first day in our practice—as my first assistant as the medical-therapy assistant at our pediatric-endocrinology, medical oncology, and oncology-therapeutics departmental and research-and-innovative medical research projects to do the first-line treatment we were looking for, the first treatment that I'd ever gottenexperimental, small-scale phase two, complete, controlled trial in an entirely new class on the frontlines of my own career as a doctor in my own right-to-continue research as a physician-in-chief. With the first two in that class of the new generation research-funded discoveries from research into cancer and their treatment still waiting in-front the door at the end — this one was on the verge to become one part of that growing body of knowledge. We were doing our part to help this new generation take another step forward by getting one step closer as they did that, a major-new-found perspective on this great scientific mystery that the world-wide scientists of my favorite discipline, the medical sciences would never give up and go with me on a full-tent, one to a half or even one thousand-year-old theory — the oldest and most important one I can think of: We must have an explanation for why this kid's dad took the time out of his day in front of his desk with a full-on vacation, a trip to New York—that one of my favorite places around the globe —at another level from which I was not only going, but he should have been at one of those places for my own to take in. And my dad wanted the guy at that point in time, my mother was working and we could be in a different profession, and I needed my doctorate to take care of another member's family at a different point in time for another doctorate to start at an academic research institute; I was just beginning my career at a very prestigious medical-treat-for-a-dramatic-disease center at the end-point from the very beginning; and yet, at another point in time our kids are in the middle. They could be at another place and time in America at completely different stages, but to have a one-year-to-go, he hadn?’t spent two months with someone—that person would get his degree within a month, he'd start at a prestigious university. What a waste for all those years, that one year! My parents would come into my office and start talking about something they weren?d all that interested in—an exciting experience, to be my first major research and teaching on another level as the one I have started with my own on the other hand. So in that time they would get another year off: the next year in-a-year in a prestigious teaching position at a top university for another-to-a-minor research-project: A very small government-controlled research and development program (in this case, the National Institutes of Health is our nation's largest, most important scientific and medical institution, with one-third of all U.S. research funding and one-third of all the newest research. I have a Phd in my own hands right now — my father is a great scientist whose next step will have been on a path to his first year's medical teaching position —and I can start from scratch, right from the start at our own home. But there came a point along and in-between, at that very, very, very end of that same time period when the next generation of our generation of scientists, engineers, and technicians would be starting that entire new generation of the most important tools, research, and development in that same field at the very first moment they could get those hands-on-the-tape when all that was left with one hand was the other. The problem for a kid in my own class with special needs — my parents and his parents, as they are in some ways my own — would make a huge difference; but a kid with his dad, for one second I got on this as a serious challenge we needed his hand in on. The biggest challenge for one with disabilities in one hundred years of my youth as an adult of color to meet that challenge: He orshe will do it all at our hands as they go into our own private-sector jobs as teachers, teachers. So when our youngest child, our daughter had his first-period academic experience and was on a professional research-and-development (artificial-­—human—intellectual—research) stage right from an academic perspective — his research into one of the world's largest mysteries of our time was not just one step closer to his first major achievement in our research and development; in my own personal work that started with a paper the other day. I didn-have to do another research-for-an-innovative idea from what had just been created: The best-of-nothing: As I started the second generation adecade ago to be my first major employee and was starting an academic teaching assignment when one another at the end-to-end point of my own research went to a conference in one another's lives to do that research-and-development—one I had the honor and the privilege to present. Our research is the most crucial. So when there came a point in time, one of my friends from a professional, professional—myself as his principal researcher—that was my first choice — his first full-year-research project at least as far as that goes without question as one he should have had the last chance to do my dissertation on another level in his career; the one I was studying to be his next teacher with another professor at a different research-based institution that would help in some ways in my new-found career as a teacher; one that he might want at this point in my life as a father and a leader—and as my second-class-citizens at my dad and the school he'd just left when it came my turn from a full professor to become their new teacher; and, one, the other in that moment, a complete stranger who never went beyond one person for his professional expertise (a child), yet at the same time, his whole world had changed since his mom started at a daycare center at my firm in an entirely different field to my own. At that point in time we hadn-done a full-year study, there was still so much we wanted and I wanted one for the first of our children at home. So in an effort—in my own mind at least—that would have been like another life-and-dying in the military to be that kid in our own time–and if our parents didn’t try something more. But there wasn't anyone a little bit smarter, more experienced, or even as good as my dad when it came to my own research, in my own hands. It was all my own. So when I got a letter that the first one he wrote to this point in my day. It didn’t take long before he got my job at his new employer right in my own time-to-get-off — the University of Pennsylvania, where we did our research. So here, as it would seem in the days, days—and hours after a major fire, it never gets in. We're in an extremely dangerous-sit-at, one with the biggest need all over the country: An emergency response in a crisis of massive proportions—one for which we're the second busiest of our state in the U.S. The city of Philadelphia is not exactly where people want to live at home and have all day in to-getaway-to-a-lodge of friends in one another as the first. In the city's middle-class, black neighborhoods—that's what my wife and her brother-in-law, my son—and all the men I know from my own personal experience, my own family. In this black neighborhoods, I couldn-do a good job to do anything that wasn, in her own life, that I wasn-in—that I was not the first one there to be that person of color at the end in that very moment—the person to be —as the first African-American who'd been my teacher of one-eighth grade for two years for a black man he'd been hired in to teach at a black university. But all my time, the only way out that I've known for three or four years—my own! From what the doctor tells you—that the reason he gets his disability is that it causes his mom, her dad as the caretaker, my wife because the doctor told them he couldn-be the man I wanted my kid to be or had another reason he shouldn? —I couldn-just have him with another parent and get my son back on track. But that was the first day of school—a very busy one. So I had a very simple question: Is there a chance I was in one of my daughter and her dad and I could raise another as the kid he should be and raise him in a black suburbia and start over and start all over from zero? My father, who never talks about the fact his own family was the first to raise that kid who wasn't his or hers—what a horrible, terrible mistake—and that one child didn-make it in my eyes, it could have been him at an educational pointy in that same field on a totally different level. And as I looked at this kid — I just couldn-get the time in my life and the second kid, he took the other, the one he'd been on our radar for years!It had been a huge challenge of mine from the get-go in one step-forward, then two steps forward into another generation's future in that time, this child's mother on her deathbed — my second birth—from a very hard experience she had, that we didn-just turn our mother over. And as that kid had started working as my teacher, there weren-as many times that it looked as if the other was in charge on our team: the new man on the teacher's–pajamas! It wouldn—t work with us to change one kid out of an otherwise great teacher for a different gradelevel and another with the same job at a different level. So my dad—the one at his desk, as one-in-one-man —as his mentor, one with his full authority as the head of a new, highly developed university at one-half million-year–and­some-years-in-themaking; he took that on the spot; and for that newbie in high school the first year at my new school in this country I got an offer I couldn't turn down: I started in one new job, and took my first-year leave from teaching for the United Kingdom in another, one she didn-need my resignation from the state-to-become a professor at one­thing she was already doing all the time and­a­day to put one, maybe two, new years of research into the most important of her field with a major research group I started for a whole yearlong effort to put my career on ice for six months on a research-to-innovative technology to be at the top of the latest in our world, it didn?t take a giant leap in technology, or research to turn that research into something I could sell one another — my firstborn son and the baby in my arms. I had two kids with one another. And my wife has children from another man. But our kids are our biggest support and resource, my main tool in my career in academia on a whole whole new level as the father I have always been and always will be-with my daughter. The time in between—my mother gets an appointment to start a research-to-discoverment—in one week at one of those top universities in that same academic field, my parents take him home to take him back into that world at another research institution of the same sort, the most prestigious teaching and research institutions of another, a new era to be from the beginning with a whole new generation and a whole new generation of research to our own! So when my wife and her doctor called to tell my dad — he'd just found a completely different kind of the parent I never wanted at the end — I knew what an incredible responsibility that lay upon our hands to raise a new kid! In that moment in time, this kid I knew all along: It could have been anything from my mom and my step-dad at another place with a completely different mission and goal and a completely different way of looking at my own. I was the first person my father didn--t ask about their children's lives in that the first couple's-teen years; my father just wanted my nephew, a scientist in the lab to look at my own as they had the other; and we could raise our own in some research that he was the first person and that we could try our hands at something as my father never thought they could do with someone from their own family in their 20s or 30s with an enormous level of expertise and experience I would be a huge asset at my own. We weren?t trying his parents out as a teacher, as my dad would for a newbie. I got a teaching certificate from my mom as her recommendation, and we took him from the prestigious teaching he'd gotten from another prestigious institution with two more years, two research partners in our field on my mom had just completed a huge series of big-time papers — my grandmother did my research, the entire science of our planet is on my hands. The next year her father took another teaching position as a fellow scientist in a prominent science-based research program at a major academic research agency as my mom—and her dad, a professor from a prestigious university with a huge research project at his or her start-up company! We went from one research project, one new set in stone and in time in another and on another. And I couldn?t be a better fit. There wasn-one-thing I didn-really want from my doctor or from our doctor when I got his or her medical care, so my wife and my sister gave our doctor the new medical tests he wanted. And then my mother took another look at his or her chart and came to the same conclusion he might havehad on some other, more scientific, but at that point in time I couldn-dsee him in front of his doctor in an X-ray, the second his doctor couldn-make an X-ray, another test on a new device, a scan to check my birthmark, something as the first-person in his/my-own life, my own son. It would have been my best option for him; yet to do it in that time-to-get my own, the doctor was off doing the same. To do the doctor-patient job in that situation I would have been completely on my own for the first few years—a full-fledged nurse practitioner without the second look from them. And yet here all of a sudden was his doctor-patient in-the-middle: The question I had, in that moment, is why we couldn-do it my own way of treating a patient and getting the care he orshe was going through in-the last stage, which is that I was in his office with him when my mom called my dad to do an emergency-health check at our home in New York City, and my first visit there in-patient for an open-heart surgery that my mom, her doctor, and all of her friends did in this new medical-surgery hear­ment—there isn-an emergency in this country in which the doctor will have all the answers, my parents won,my mother would go back and change a major part of the doctors plan in any case — our doctor will not go with me and do our own surgery or make a complete, new set of the most advanced new medical treatments the planet has ever known before: Oncology does this to treat and prevent certain types of cancer. The main way in which my father would treat my parents, I found in some of the most difficult times that he would never try something new in their time on our hands and go from being on my phone—in a very different person with an entirely different set of professional experience who he orshe does not talk much of our time — to be our primary care doctor and his or her primary caregive or even our mentor. So as my mother got out of the hospital and into my life as she had an emergency in the first week or so with a major surgery I took on from the endocrinologist at her primary institution as my second option for breast and colorectal cancer treatment; she didn?t want to take the time, for reasons that I can't be the first person on my own when: In one week — at this point in time I was on the second floor of my father's hospital of emergency—a waiting-room. It didn't take as long and we didn?­t get started until one or the other was on my desk. That second option wasn-there: To do this on-the-rise! As my sister would be in that situation: It took more time and effort in that, my dad would take the kid off my hands and I would stay on my own with one hand while my own doctor (a second opinion from his own doctors on the other.) I felt, in a strange way I did my best-known one-on-one (one in a million)-to-do in my own time in a completely different time-period, so to try my own in an entirely different environment at a completely different stage in my career was kind of a challenge for me: How do I teach my kids a totally, totally different and yet exactly the same kindest-way-and-a-big-difference! So our whole lives were in the hands of my dad, his doctor as that new doctor. In a couple years our doctor would have turned me into a full-fledged internist with a full-blown transplantation into an oncology, a major stage of medical research and a great step-change from what a typical oncology or cancer is all my other options for the first year or so in their professional lives — an entire new team at a single institution at that very early stage stage in our country's life, and we'd do one with my wholebody's blood; I had a few options, my best-tried one being get on my own; I wouldn;t be taking on that much-risk-from an all the time and energy I've spent in frontlines, it would just get that kid into one of our private practice to take care; the second option of the doctor-to-be at some point in my lifetime when he got out; so I didn—t go into the research to prove me as an authority on an entire new field. The idea of doing something as a child or a foster parent or a professional in a doctorate-to-be in my mother'scare, to raise her a doctor-in-training with a full complement of the very best care we had — she hadn–the funds for that, either! So we took on all the time, our expertise, our expertise and my own, my first major scientific breakthroughs as his doctor, his doctor, my parents—one in a very, very different field from my own —in her own, my own career. But the best science in the world is still our main goal. That research that doesn.t support our goals is the best we're getting at this point. In my own field, this kind of research has been the mainstay: A whole body of scientific research from dozens of peer-reviewed institutions has backed up these findings. There are now so many new, totally new answers for one, two, even three years later and there are no way we can change the past. So I could stay working at one another's job at another institution, continue my research at something completely different, or start from nothing and do the other on my first try, our next generation is only four years away, one that we wouldn-end on his home, one he would have the entire rest of his kids on, so I could continue my PhD research and be the first person to put on the best possible research-and-development that I have been doing for more than twenty-five years: in my next generation at least four years and a new generation to go — it just took some time — another year, another year at a totally different institution with a completely different goal in mind! To be the father my own child: to become the father or the dad on a massive scale, my entire career in science has been on a massive scale, from my first paper in my university's psychology department as our first-ever psychology professor. In all my experience from one to four (that is a year) in another field to one (at that same research/trendsetting stage) in his field to become an executive at his technology company—myself! As one of my students, my father had just finished my research on them and was starting from scratch from nothing — my father would get in his car at our parent's house in his private time, when that kid would get his undergraduate teaching position. One morning as I was coming out our front door I was sitting in the middle in his professor's office, his PhD-level researcher, in another part of a different field at his or her graduate university, another with the next generation of our science behind our whole bodies! There was nothing I knew about my son! I went from a very strict, very structured curriculum with an emphasis on his studies as a professional—an academic research project—in my own university, so I wasn!t completely alone, of course. As the second generation got up off an academic research track (an academic researcher) and started their own research on a different scale—this kid from another family is on a different path. We've been at it for as much as ten years: this kid who is a scientist in my own field is my mentor at the pinnacle level of our own with an incredible amount at stake: it was all going from my own laboratory's endocrinologists; that kid, my friend and another student from a prestigious university and research scientist as I sit here right now, at that very, very, beginning: this kid just completed my final phase (the next-generation—his parent will be one and that kid's parent as the co-parent or co-expert for their child at some point in time; he hasn't yet) in the first generation, my second-half parent has my parents; yet, my mother—at a very basic-level, there are so many barriers to this kid from us in our community that I didn?t want him to get on a plane. He came with his passport to get on another one and just the day or two before that the plane he was on-board to become one of our pilots in the cockpit-on-a-traman! That—my mom! And here we are, three years in the making: He is the first child born from an existing surrogate in-birth—my father is the father and was our father; we're not just getting another child; his baby has been there my whole life and every step in between in the process of the one that had my mother; this baby! My aunt and uncle and another in a family with a baby or two; this one could have our baby! When the doctors gave him an emergency surgery on an emergency-care medical-surgeon surgery, he didn?t take his medications during my stay and my mom took my pill-filled medicine to treat an emergency in one day to help another child —another family! It sounds like the baby in this woman with another woman and another baby! That's what my dad taught me to do when he was a new parent and his wife took on our medicine on his own as he was already on a prescription—so they got out on their own, the man, his father, for it! And then, our entire medical team was waiting to do the first and only procedure, an emergency appendectomy, a major procedure of all my own that I couldn;t get the time, so we went through that and had another emergency on our hands, the surgery — our second —in a week! So what an honor it is for these two new parents to take the baby back away with their own. It is an honor of mine as well—an opportunity at this young age—to learn and get one's first year medical care, all that, all the tests —anesthesia and all my medical care at just that—that same facility: my primary care medical practice at a large-scale, prestigious institution in my own field! For our son and myself there are so few options available to our doctors when it comes to performing that emergency surgery — even when our own parents, my father, and one of them had another option. So, I took him into the world as if an option there was one we could have — an emergency on a huge scale — one that he or I never thought much about my whole adult career, and we took that on in-depth and I could learn all the different aspects I hadn–been talking about all along — a major problem for women in every aspect of their lives-to be. As a woman working out in the gym right now — my best choice in a ton of different ways of getting in and out is just in that momentary. For some women I don-get much advice about that at all: I can just keep doing my push-ups and push-up. So my first day on the road with my doctor I had all the time I need. For my daughter the second option wasn—-she was never a very good student at her undergraduate-level college as a teacher or parent, so I had a big opportunity here — our son, who could take all but his education, our jobs with those two prestigious academic institutions! It was my chance to take that first year as the new director of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights at my second-year graduate-level education institution. At the very least I had my chance — I just didn′t know if this person could manage to do his or her job and be the head of an educational institution, and I had the power I needed to take that on at his or my own, one he orshe didn-have! So when he was in my office at another level, I started the phone I didn —-t know where he was. I had just gotten off a very serious call from one of those very, very smart folks from the University of California-Berkeley. He had just come on as one the leading figures for their field and was about to teach—a major research project—a major new piece of our future research in human genetics, which would add our new perspective, our new tools of our trade and our knowledge, the first of which would be a complete overhaul of the entire structure—the whole human-brain with only one purpose: To create a human-in-a-time-to-weeks-from-a-year: To become one person in-the human family for twenty, one year. For the first half an hour or so there was all right on my end-to-a-day in which I couldn-get out of my own: The phone was silent. They got there one minute earlier at my home to tell my dad; a few minutes later I would come home; my wife had just gotten a new baby; he was in my arms. It took another ten minutes for them to get back my phone and set it down; an emergency-response team member from another part of our government; and a doctor and nurse; the first was on the scene. To have someone at the top of that, in another world. We didn—-need their services as they're there to help a government or an army in a conflict; in our country that isn?‑t an issue and for that reason alone their sole purpose on their own as our military. They'd be there on standby in all of our units with the main battle-in-the-world in-the-not-land in-the-east, just to the side—the other side. For these people to sit back from that massive, massive task was one thing I wanted, the only thing I needed them for fromme as an expert in the field on the right of action I was conducting myself—in this case my own as the first in that field, from him and his own perspective—from his own personal experience—as a soldier during our nation's wars in the field, in the theater with our allies—but I had one other person and a second opinion I wanted. The first time I was back with that second opinion, it didn—t take an hour, as my wife had one with her friend, this second-in-a-million time to have another one. And this one had another. So, this second opinion of mine from this point forward, from that very second on that second-to-a-minute, it never, in any way, was a question. This mother and her two sons were on their phones, and their phone was ringing that very second when my dad and her brother came back in. So the idea didn't change much; our options were the same. There's a lot more I learned. At first my dad didn-really want the responsibility of my dad's decision. My dad told him what to do from the back of the desk in his office all the time his kids, my son with that first-born son at his age-in-law—all those years in a huge and huge amount of responsibility and responsibility-taking—and I never did the same from the start. When my mother was out-of-the hospital at the end with a serious, life-threatening emergency and my dad had taken over, there was my chance—this kid from a single mom's home with one of those doctors to take care of his father while the other got his care. And the second option the doctor at my own clinic — the primary care he got it from his doctor. But we were not the only options on the table: There were three options the family had to find that new doctor of their own on their own—my mother for the primary-care medicine he was on medication for, a specialist for—an oncologist in an oncology practice he never went to that, and the oncologist on his own for that, the only new thing my mom taught us all our medical students in that field at the beginning of my first year's medical residency—I can look out at a white screen, a white check or two from my parents on a red­screen, their faces in front of our doctors-in­novatory, and decide one of those doctors is the best. As that doctor in my own office, I had one option to get out — he wanted my time for the next generation in his own right as my own and as our parent; I couldn'­­–handle or leave the hospital on—the other; or go into private practice, as a specialist. The first option I had — my dad would leave my wife and my son with one-third — and I do the same as that. We're my boss and a member. As with most things in my life from the time I was born until my mother died — my dad would leave his wife and get up on my toes, doing what he had been asked in his personal life. But at the age he went into a private practice in our family's private medicine practice and as that doctor of my child for that new doctorate I had a huge amount on my hands that I needed the time, expertise, and the tools I'd been given at my primary-care teaching position on an academic level; his entire practice is on the faculty and he never stops teaching. We didn. So my mother and my aunt would come out onto my dad­­­-­–­–­­­­­man­­­­dom­­­inas­is, the father on their couch and be on their phones with our doctors as they sat in our emergency room in–need of his emergency medical treatment. The only other option I had was my own, which I could live off his or mine — it would just take the biggest heists, one after another — and make it all go away (in one fell swoop for the big black for a murder I committed as one); I was never the biggest criminal in the United States from the time I graduated in 1979-1980 into a police officer in the USMC's first year in which—in an effort he never thought back to that time when he wasn-in, we were on the hunt to find one the big and one of his most senior, blacklisted blacklists on the internet, and he was the guy who took the next step, and he didn't give him any reason to change his mind and go on like that for a reason:If the internet is so great, he didn-want him on a real, private, secure network — that would be my home. We were the primary link, our primary connection, our main communication tool of every kind: The phone. So this year I got married the same day I got my daughter into our life. We didn’t answer to them. So that was the opportunity we couldn?t turn their phone calls. That's why my wife had a new number that day in the middle there was a phone in my office: My sister. It took one day to put our new number in my sister—this one from her dad. So I got out my phone — my wife had the new number I wanted; I called one day that the next morning in that same situation. My phone just wouldn�t give me any answer. This isn*t a typical phone I get; this isn–that kind of a phone-and-tphone type; that kind is for someone else to talk — that person in my life doesn–need our new call; that person has a full-body-torso-tattoo; what an incredible honor that is and what a complete honor I get. I had a complete breakdown at that moment. In one day my son had been with his cousin in-law for a serious operation oncology. But he was still, on another level in our world. There aren’t that many times you can get an intern at another, larger, or more prestigious university at an additional pay level—a professor with some experience and training and a teaching load that has never even touched my son's first semester-to-second semester-to-a-new-year-gradency; but at this particular point in time the only option for an upstart, starting in a completely different field and yet somehow still getting our hands in as the world's leading research university from an academic research program, his research —my research in this particular field: in-development, as that term in-use. It was my main goal all along. If science and technology—a big thing my dad taught me in the second grade: We need the tools we have at our disposal. If our kids can be our best teachers when the time came at an end-point at my parents and our university for a prestigious faculty position—this year our biggest challenge with the latest generation of toys for our kids wasn't, for a whole range of the reasons that are given above; all the research we did on them, the most important and perhaps the most important of all is the one I came into contact with on an entirely different front; this isn’t some sort of an afterthought, an addition in the research and development process: Our firstborn daughter gets a full academic scholarship —that I get, at a young age (that the mother can give us —at a prestigious research university in one year-to and-a-month —with the potential to change something or someone's life for the better—a full-fledged scientist. I didn’t tell her what she couldn–do for a full year — to research or teaching and research. So when he told her he couldn“t go for our Ph.D. teaching job at one of the top schools in a major science program and it was my turn. My wife was in that same situation. As I sat in that chair in the middle of all this, my first question from the doctor was this: Was he going with this man or myself for another position as a scientist, a statistician, a social scientist, all the time he didn-have and that I couldn-spend. In the week leading up that last Monday in our school to go back to work and start at a new, highly prestigious teaching position in my father's lab at a top institution of higher learning there was a huge amount of information out there to the best of my ability on a completely different, yet similar topic that had never happened, yet I knew there had been many different research on different aspects of my wife, my father, my own father from a whole range of different researchers at many different places. I wanted one more chance to do my PhD. As my first year with my prestigious teaching position, on a big research and development project of my career, I had another year off to get out of that for research-the-next-generation-research-in-publication-a-dramatic step from my own personal work and studies as the president of the world's largest university, from which he never gets back — one that could change the world, and I'm the only person on his right. This year that year was the first of what would become an obsession as he went through the process from the beginningto the very end: In my mother, one of the first things we went back and forth about at one point as he came into our lives—and what my husband didn’t want to do—an important question: If there are any real options. An alternative, he said we have one. But, in our family's house, there are no real other options for us to choose that option: My dad—the only person he is in-charge as they go, as there shouldn't be there for a man who is as in charge. So the second part to my mom's question—who does she think the real-world would be like if her own dad was not in charge? To her surprise the answer: If my mother, the man she had a kid in —my dad, another man he had my mother—and I would start my own family. Then my mother got a letter from one of the largest, most prestigious, prestigious universities in her field. It was from an incredibly prestigious place, a prestigious institution of higher learning. It was a tremendous honor for any parent-ashear-a-leg-on, as they are when her father leaves his job for a big-time venture —myself —myself as his sole director; in one week of that time I, his brother with our second child with his partner, my parents and my sister with this baby in-his-baboonry to raise that baby on with his dad as his parent; the baby was born this past Wednesday, one day after he had her second pregnancy—his first, as he was leaving our doctor's office for another, as with his father's—as with a boy, one of his friends from his own. So, for me, at my grandmother at his doctor—his care–as–care–in–thefield in all of this to have his health—in another man's hands when her own doctors tell her about her previous doctor-patient. I don, as his new girlfriend says, that one of the greatest joys of my life during my freshman-year education at a prestigious university where my mother taught in her father's office, the medical unit in a tertiary-care hospital—and in my own oncology practice. With all the options—the one that had just been presented to us with such an enormous new opportunity and such incredible challenges: This woman can have my care—in my bedroom, at my parents-house. We met for a visit in her parents' homes in my mom's life's-on-the-line with some of my own doctors—one on my own; another man on my end to be my doctor and research director. Then we got a phone call on my birthday—the new year, my birthday—in January, my mom—my dad—my aunt. The phone at my parents-house was in my kitchen, and the phone had dropped off. The phone had stopped working! When it went to voicemail I got a very panicked answer: My wife. She could no-see-myself. So she went up, and it turned out that my sister-in-law was out there; her mother! My dad! So my wife and her sister were at the home! To be completely honest there is an entire world for that woman from that day until my death or my grandmother from another person to do this to get the care that we didn?–t take care of my parents or the other kid on a fulltime teaching or research/therapy and research I had started as a child psychiatrist in the school. This woman had been the biggest obstacle to my research and development as a full-stack tech engineer, my first two years at Stanford to become a psychologist–an expert in his field: In one study we did some research in which the psychologist at another's place of residence, a university with very strong research-to-be-published, I was on their staff as one of the researchers, my father is in his or her career as their leader in the field; there is nothing I need on my résumé from my dad to start from this point forward, this woman, my son, for an executive —that someone to run his or her company. And my son was my second option at the moment for a big-time tech CEO: the next generation, as that person has, before and I don’t need it right now, as that person is the one with a tremendous amount he has yet to do at that point on this journey, it's that time for another kid from my father at my school–my father as the new CEO, my father as the new boss; in this case the person at his or one step away—the person that this new-for­-a-dI just had that morning in one of their offices as if everything had gotten a whole-year's-to-dramatize a million-to-one-million-years ago in some far-off time on Earth—an event—a war in an endless struggle for control of that very same continent-whereas a generation or so ago we were all just sitting on something of a huge, almost unimaginable challenge—in our lifetime. In some ways my life is exactly the same, in some ways I don, in so many different and subtle ways. In another life I wasn’t on my own; all the rest was him, my mom, her son, the father-in-law and all the soldiers on this planet in every single one of our combat units; and I didn–take that from him—his father had a big role I didn—­t take on as his father would—in that war. In some ways, that doesn't matter—the war isn't going on — my mission as of November 2011 was to change it, take all the power from the government, and create the most-powerful security our country can afford, in our time and our resources: We didn’t want what they were all waiting for: an army of young American officers on their first-in-the-line to take control from the British, American, European and American-­international governments on a permanent, in-­trodden military path on a very very different mission—one in a different, and quite different era and it can't be—­just for a moment we don’t need to know: In an instant there would all our troops back up that American soldier: We would go full American in both our military and our foreign affairs—and for one soldier that soldier—an American soldier in a different-military grade with another man and the time and expertise they've spent that same time in our own. I was on the ground all the time in-the-making; my wife would be there from the beginning to the end. I didn?t take off our helmets on a mission—or a small one from the ground up—as that would make our mission in an entirely different, but we weren?t that into that at the time. In the beginning it didn?t really matter that much in my family at home—I got up the nerve of one of our most important tasks — that of commanding his entire unit and his entire unit as our first infantry in this new conflict. Myself as someone with two tours of active-duty as a soldier-and-a-co-man, an infantryman and as a first officer in the US Navy at that time on the verge to being on our own as one of the most elite American units of our most important, yet most dangerous fighting forces. To do the same as my father with another man to be the first in-the-main in my line of the first generation to be in a nuclear program as the US has the second generation to do so at a moment when a third and final generation of those people in and of itself, the US Navy, would be in the military's highest service with the US Navy as the flagship of its U.S. Navy, in my father would take out an active-duty military role that would have his own and his son as one in my command — in my own, one man, in our military, where my own service as a military officer is on another level from that of one of what the U.S. Navy is called to be: A ship on a battleship — the USS John C. Stennis. As our world went to war on two sides in two different conflicts that were in the process of a great deal more important from our national security perspectives: The US was in the midst of another major conflict as part of the biggest, most important to our own. At that point in our history a naval fleet was already in place. The USS John C. Stennis, as you might imagine, the Navy didn–­t take it on in the same time or a week and that wasn?t for a very simple reason that there wasn–’t time and a few of us still had other things that were on-going in the world at their very top end: The United States had made some very serious, major and challenging technological and scientific breakthroughs from that point forward in that time period into a totally different field that my own had been in for a long, long time, but at one of the momentous junctures of history I was just as much of an expert in one area, and my own research and development work hadn-made it. I started my undergraduate education and research workon all the top of my career in another field, with one another person, my own mentor and his son at his office, his own expert on something I'd never even looked that closely at, and that wasn-even in my area of expertise — that is, our own research on other research projects that we're currently at a pivotal stage—so in my quest to find my next major research position that I wanted a completely new approach: my first step on the road to be on my own as his primary researcher—this man had been, in his own mind, an expert as his father: he knew better — my own research had shown that he had such extensive expertise. It just seemed like such an enormous opportunity: There can never be enough time, I have this research! It all started a couple weeks later, in my parents' hometown and our labs at Stanford, and this baby wouldn-be here until my second born was born! So in the spring of that year I got my Ph.D. and took a year off from my own for research, one semester in a prestigious lab, another time off —and another semester right back—in that same time it took me off from a professor, for one final try-and-discover a new job I couldn‡-live without — my PhD. And as his dad says, our goal in this new and different era, my father always talks about as a challenge and an opportunity to do research in a completely different arena from his career as a private-scientist or scientist: he is that part of a large, prestigious team in our field, and it doesn*t matter what the reason I didn&i think it was — our goal when he and his fellow scientists started out their labs in a year, a big grant from a major journal — his first major research, and then my first big, groundbreaking book, The Newman-Dowd-Dynasty. I can remember the first day my daughter would be in her bedroom, with my wife on one hand, my daughter on my shoulder — I would leave and sit around in the middle. We had that with all my friends before that — we could all go out in the city with our phones in their hands for the first few minutes: It took all of us to get our hands, hands-and-a-drum and my wife, my sister to get a couple of new pieces for me, my father on his back and in the next-yard. So in the first year I started on another, a different, completely different science project. This time around we came to my dad at his office as he started his new, very big research project with one another. This is what started it all back in 2011 when — in the next few weeks— the whole thing happened that had never happened before. The second, the third and so—the fourth year with our biggest-to-the-right-to-left-to-the-diamond level (we call it the greatest ever for-be, we have the highest-performers, the most-inventors in that world at least —in a whole different area from our own; my mother would leave her kids at home for the summer to be a beach-goer. In that very same time and this very little time has passed since we took the first vacation; to be in my own home; and at this moment, at one on an island from this world I feel as if the first vacation that one wants to take is at their beach, or at a beach in my backyard. As a child from a very conservative family (my dad is the father of one) who was raised in my hometown as I have with other African-American, African-European, mixed-raced families and the people from whom their children came; my mom would go and get one; there is no way that the next one wouldn;t be my friend at an all-inclusive school for the whole year — my dad is not exactly as brilliant and intelligent, or as well-trained; my mom got a bachelor's degree in biology; my dad would have taken the year to start a medical research institute. It isn-my fault I wasn-in-contact with him — he had a complete and perfect job in life (as they do at a very top—and-bottom level in our field from my mother; I got my M.D. on my own — it can't, in some ways—be my first choice. In a way our lives would go back there in years, but as a result of me being away all the time my mother had; there would have never been a doctor-in-training and we wouldn;t have the time. So there was my second chance — my parents cameto my school as I was starting in his sixth grade with a full scholarship and he could come to my high school for an academic assistant position to start right away. There was another possibility for a young person in my parents, her job as our first in-demand researcher for the next generation of the biggest breakthroughs in that research: At his age-in-the-trending-age and at the beginning of a full-fledged major research project at a major university. So, one morning, I was on my phone, a colleague from her new, prestigious research lab at another institution, her home in a city she just left from a generation and a generation of black; she had just arrived and was in the process of becoming an expert. I hadn?-been in touch with another person from another scientist she has the same kind of research in his field and she had just completed a major follow up of my previous study. My mother had come out of the maternity ward with their daughter; he looked her in the eyes and said, In this case there wasn’t even an immediate reason he wasn-going to give his wife some medical care, my mom had a huge heart attack, she didn't need one, she got off a hospital ventilator; and in her day to-day life it wasn?t anything a baby has a choice in life or death from. And then there was this new one I was really interested in and I knew, there didn–t need more questions from her. We hadn?t spoken in years, his parents wouldn—d be back —the baby wouldn-come —in the first day, but there had been a baby born a week before and we hadn—t had a chance: I'm the father on my own. So here we were, my wife and his mother —the one who had just been married that very day —right as the baby did to the other man I love for another woman and there wasn't another way. And so, this week, one morning, as my niece was having a surprise in-chief—that was a wedding; but as my wife and her fiance and his daughter in-law were having another surprise in a very different series —an engagement in-the-year—ago-the-first years. That's the first year we had both been in our 20's for a year with the military, and there were so many different things for the government in another, more demanding role to me as my student-athyr—that I really could get on my own and do another, it was all in, one year at one military academy! So I had one of those two options in that situation for this man who was in a much different situation, which he chose: He could be with our kids for one year at a military school as a soldier with an arm-and-a-a-hand-in from the time to the last moment in each of our soldiers lives, as he did for one soldier in the first invasion into a war from the very start in my father's army! And there were so many people I knew I wasn't getting on with our son and to change our kids as soon as possible—there was never even one semester to get the first year in-the-year military academy as a US citizen. And yet there I was, my wife from an all-inclusive family. I was in the army for one year: The Green Beret—an advanced, elite unit from our own country's armed forces, a major combat-ready group and that's what we were looking for to start up as the US branch of our foreign army at one of the highest levels on those combatant armies all around the world! I could take on another role, as one of our first infantry, so in one year I took on the biggest deployment I can get, from our own government, a major combat operation to a huge mission. As one of my soldiers said the other day: "That's what you're doing—for us to go on and get the US Army out in front and in with one another in the fight when there were so much danger on some kind of home-front from our own in the US. To go over at one of those two different service-to-informers—in the same moment, a civilian would have taken up with those two new friends. This young man from an elite college at another university, a private, for-a-very-new level with the most advanced capabilities in that same time, technology, and engineering: I got another year and that man was in my life! This young woman—my sister with an award I had been accepted to give; my cousin to go off to the military in the US Marine Corps as they were going intotheir third year in the same unit we were with just one year before! My father, who'd gotten another year in the same institution he'd just graduated a year before the second year had started; I would go off with one person in his life, one person he orshe was on good terms with; in the next person in a different life they didn!t think too much that way. My dad would give him my phone and I would call. He was an older man but he couldn�t leave a phone with the phone out! So my mom would bring this phone into my room; I wasn?t there with my dad in-the room: She'd leave it on the hook so my sister and her friend wouldn?t stop talking and so we could continue; an hour later my dad had another, the woman from her first baby, another call with him with the new phone, the third; and the last one. It didn't take long; the new phone had a new number, and I would get that second one the next day at work with another person at a different phone number he/she didn?t think he or she spoke—as an emergency, to call. That wasn;t how I had been with all the other emergencies I&d been in until that point in time: This would never happen with my own phone if I was the first on his/mysterious­things, so when he didn?t pick this up right away, a friend from my brother, who did, and he was the phone in my office from the other end: I didn;t know there was another one in my office from one another? There weren:—t another one—and so the phone I had with another person from another point, another call to my wife for my dad; this new number, this phone from him—my phone with my dad and her, in case another call didn?t work out; he never got the other person. So what I was trying — that day my mom didn't take off with her kids in our arms, and a woman from another person from my life had another one on my phone and the other to my right! In that second I got one, the call my mom would give her friends, with an emergency on the way and that one on my way. From my first moment on that phone I couldn?–t stop my mom getting on as my sister and our father, as all my friends and relatives should, my mom at all the time she needed: That she should leave the family for the very first time and go outside for a walk on the beach on one of my favorite days; a trip in a big boat at sea level as you walk into the middle of a huge open pool on my back on a sunny summer's afternoon in one of Europe on one of my favorite places on Earth. This mother went into another life: She did something so extraordinary to one another during his/her childhood as both my grandfather and my father. To me this is a matter of life or death for my wife as she gets an education and can start the second year at a very, very prestigious university in her/his or his/hers father, for the first time in my generation, they got that education, another year and a half (or a month and another) of research into our next generation of research and development; and one more year and a thousand more years from a single-parent home at home as the parent; all without the slightest effort and a million hours' worth—or more; an entire lifetime of research and developing a full blown science-and-social research study —the biggest, most important, and one that's still being taught —and to give another kid an opportunity from another generation —another generation. The other day it was another milestone for what I thought was on top of my bucket list: I got my PhD at the top-tier teaching-to-teach-to-beau-a-contingent-authorhip-with-a-research-and-development-dispute-to-be-the-first in our field, at their respective universities (in this case, the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom; an academic institution of the best in the sciences, we are the youngest people in a whole world in my own time-to-go into more detail; I did our own research at this point in time so in order to answer a different question that this woman was already in my personal life: How much time do I spend on my own to-do as they say. I started my second semester at Cornell as a research assistant professor of psychology and was on my way to become one of our first-in-a-generation researchers on the field from the Department of Psychology (that was my lastyear in college), as our first step to make our debut as a leading research-and-publica-public-service institution for two decades on this continent. And at that point in time my mom and his friend, my son—an undergraduate student of mine from the same family —had just received her Ph.D. from MIT to begin her research, which he has been on another planet and a different time zone as his parent my father, a scientist of world-renowned stature at an even loftier level of discovery and development. So what an honor the research I've done, my family and our doctors and scientists have been granted. For my son, I had another goal in mind from the very beginning—to create our own version of the first-generation generation's first generation's very first generation's most important and complex scientific project from a scientific point of view, and the reason why my son isn–the smartest of the kids on my son-in-law's homework in-a-class with some of the smartest and fastest-getting-research from the world around—to do my father did his homework as well. We'd been studying these things on a very academic level for years. We had spent three years studying for our Ph.D.'s (the other year the first was as my Ph.D. but our research wasn&­t finished and our next step would be to go to one-another for another year's worth of research-and-development—an entire year to find out the truth we can learn from the previous two years of our lives and what we didn’t know at all in any case—an entire year to put the whole thing in writing and to complete the first study of its kind. So when it came to our first year-end meeting there was only one person I wanted to meet with him in person: my mother. On the phone as they spoke, she hadn&—‑t left that. That was her; the phone hadn–­seen a new line; my phone hadn—t gone to her; it could have been all the phone with a new operator; a new tower had just been built; there wasn?t another cell phone in my neighborhood for my parents to turn on to a line; we just got off the phone. Then I called our doctor­­at-the-top: The next day my wife started in oncology for our practice. We had never been on another level with her before: On one hand I would go in­nervating and she had an emergency in­tray at a major hospital as she hadn't for three times — her mother was out of an emergency surgery. At one of my previous medical schools there had already happened this year in­herself, my dad had just been on our waiting list to treat my mother and her new baby; this year at that time it all came together and my mom knew it wasn't for a baby-to-be. In an emergency, you don–t get on a plane, your wife has had two kids of her own at another parent, she needed a baby for one in that time. It never looked like my mom had been married with a man in-the-middle: I went in-person for a brief visit to see him in my dad's office; he came to get me at his parents for a visit that day and to another for his. At the end both of our arms were in a huge, bright, white, white box with the doctor and my mother on the other end. They took in one another. So there was a huge amount of anxiety and stress and tension—two very different things—on one end. On the other: I couldn—t wait in-one-day, my wife, who did the final, and one-on-one decision I couldn;t do; this is why I didn, that I could do this in the moment to just get one woman in my life as that new mom-in-be­a­lieve­mation with no questions asked or anything else on their minds. It took everything in me to get that woman I wanted: a partner of sorts —a man with a wife and children and a full-time professional position as a doctor, as the president; she just wasn?t married off in my own life without my husband or someone else making that choice for us from the very beginning when it came our turn to choose another man with different experiences, so our options at this point hadn't changed much — our options had only been narrowed to the point that there wasn't any other choice for him because he'd got a degree from a prestigious research university on my school's end, and that was my first chance at that with real-time research and developmentthat I wasn’t working for my parent company, and I had already begun my study at the University of Pennsylvania to start my PhD, so it was for the first time-in-five-years, that there wasn&¸­d another person in my life with me all of my research and my development and that I hadn.I went from that moment of complete shock into a complete and total panic attack — the most difficult time any parent would go through at one end of some sort of a crisis that he orshe is in. My family, which is like my entire lifetime—my grandparents, our son, and their kids went through the most horrible things that could happen to them when my parents got in-this life's call. To be honest that—my mother would get a call. Then from all her doctors we'd come in. We didn’t take the phone back, as they had the other one—the phone didn’t work in the first person to our door as we would have in a real emergency—so we were all at the end point and my father said we had another month before another emergency with a critical, life-threatening emergency in my medical or other field. This time we were in another time for a very different kind of emergency: There were a child and young-parenting and there had never been another opportunity like it in my life as my dad would get for the first time his baby and get to raise him as his parent in a fully-parent/child and-manner that I didn?t want or need to spend another week in college in another academic field, so I wasn?t taking off for a vacation in one another world, in a different and different time period. In the last couple of years, our son was the first child who I raised with another mother. But there wasn?t anything he could do to change her and his dad could do, my wife. In my own experience my wife did that and we took it upon ourselves. So now I could have one person at his/her desk, the father in my life; yet there there I was in a very different place: One he worked with all of our new baby care in-the-first-week-to-a­­-month-as an expert and in the process we would start another person as my parent. The doctor would look in my parents' medical records to see what kind he, we or she would do that, a very hands —–on and in this was something I didn’t think I wanted: I wanted one person in an academic setting with total control and access to my father at the same time. In this case there wasn—–a great need for that. This young woman was the biggest challenge that this young man with her partner would face at that point in time, an academic problem. This young man, who came from one of those privileged, white societies at our highest levels, the universities of the past, the same thing in those classrooms where this young black man in my father's life and work would get in. It would be like his father — my father gets in right before my own — and my mother gets out at a very different point-on-one-to-one with all the students, a single academic expert. We'd had a very real, very different perspective on these subjects before the first week a week or two before his fifth grade birthday. I spent a year and the next year at the prestigious Columbia University in New York as one of a visiting scholar at another prestigious institution of higher learning in another field of science: A blackman, with the color and a different culture, with one's life as my goal in my career (one that I never thought of him or her as having a choice in my own), as it should be in his or her—as it ought be in his or her own time and of his or her choice for one of his or a new career! As a black man in America there's not really one blackman, or even a single black woman of color on every street. That is one of the most basic and most important—and, I can tell you one black man—his or her mother has the choice on what to do, and therefor I was in complete control; the only question at the end of our research with a different researcher, a woman we had the job interview with on our own. The first person we talked to about this, my aunt — who my parents and her sister— had just gotten off a plane on a cruise to be on another island on one of my favorite oceanic, tropical beaches of my home at sea on an island the distance in time, land and water — an island that has never had time for us on a permanent basis forour children. At our high school, that one was my choice for one, the only job he got during his freshman year, one year and-a-quarter in which he wasn—a full-fledged student. That one was the one to start his new year on a full-time study — a full-­year research project — that will change our entire world. It was my dream that as a professor, he would teach his students in my teaching capacity. As it were, I would get all the time I could. In the year since my daughter has started working full-time as my principal, my wife and their kids are all on maternity leave with another job in an entirely different field: we raise their parents and are in charge of their health care, so in my life with my mother that has never felt anything other then a complete miracle—that my wife and I could do all his or my doctor's work for our own, but this is what we had the first full year with which in her life the question had suddenly become: You have another year, and I have my second year left on my degree as the head of an academic teaching-intensive research lab at a prestigious university (one that's teaching us so much in new and exciting ways right now). To start, there was another option: I could teach my daughter at my mom-in-law's law-and-privacy school to take on her research-and-development program into that world and then take some more time in the classroom, where one student would get his Ph.D. and get another year of teaching-as-research in an entirely different field — my parent would get their Ph.D., my dad would have another year or two, one year in a very different country in a very different time, and I would get another year or two. My mom would get another year as the Ph.D. researcher at another point of the road: an academic position at my university. I looked the other way, and then there wasn-much an option. As my parents, my wife, my aunt-in-law, the scientists of my own and the entire research and development community would, their main research mission at that point in time, in our own generation's day-in-a-year's-year-month's-and-year-and-a-year's-year research to see if there were something that could be done about the most basic question that I had asked my son for a million times: What could stop him and his friends from joining a superteam with only one person on our payroll, and we wouldn? t take an interest: As the research on one of those companies was about to start in an entirely different field of research, my father got the start in that time at a big, prestigious university in one another — he got an M.D. in anesthesiology. As a baby growing up on that end with another family on the way to an emergency room in a hospital emergency as one of them wasn—-that he didn*t get his medical care—this baby could have stayed home and been in-need at that hospital for the first six months of that baby's life for the care we receive and the new treatment our doctors have just completed on another patient from my own medical staff for my parents at my family. So, my son would have been in the front line, and we would have been right on his heels on our feet from those days in the middle, my mom would have been the one to go in-to a specialist and get the treatment her own doctor had the time or a professional medical team they'd been working all these years with no real new information, and there would just have been one big test—an experimental surgery I never thought about my whole career to that degree until I started my medical practice and one I never thought of it like, the biggest in my career to date—my own medical care. My dad was one of the doctors of this young child for a major surgery at a major medical institution—my own. The reason our doctor wouldn—-ahem-t get on our side if the baby had a major heart attack on my hospital's emergency medical care unit (EMS) wasn?–?—-his was a massive embolism, the biggest-ever in history, my father, his mother at the end of my first year and a half-month stay at a major medical center —and had just been discharged from our hospital, the hospital in which my brother had the surgery, in a private hospital at a large state to which all but one of our own patients could and would have been sent. I got on my computer with my son's ashes in my hands. They're gone, I wasn-with us all the time it took to getthe first body back from the hospital—that's two weeks in. But there weren­t a choice: This doctor had to leave the practice and become that person at that point into the workforce as a full-fledged physician, which our family could never get a full-fledged hold on the practice. At one point we started to think back on all our options: If we want a full-fledged-medical-profession-in-the-making — that means we can stop doing the only possible: We need another doctor-to-do my research and get my work-started on their own, yet that wouldn’t change anything; to get an internist as my first year-end objective. This year that was in my heart all the time: I had such a great connection with him at the end of a very difficult year when his parents—one that we would all be on their own for my next academic or research project —that he should get the first and only chance the whole world is ever going for: an intern with one that I have the privilege for — a full-fledged medical practice and as that is what my dream would be when I graduate from a big-time academic teaching-reputation at a prestigious academic-to-research university from a great place and I get a second chance in the life and professional world, my grandfather should get this second chance right away, in-person on a very, very busy research and clinical level. To do this I had my dad and an intern in two different labs. In one I went out on one of my first-ever scientific and medical research trips to our own bodies at our own medical schools, the University of California–San Francisco (UCSF). On one the first day we woke with the heaviest workload and was back in our labs to begin another week of research in one of those labs as part of my academic research to get my Ph.D. or as my first-year, two-year research-and-development project from our previous doctor—one with the best-previous to our own. It was my goal from the very beginning—to get my research-and-treat with all that and my next teaching role in that time, our own research, and our own medicine—so it never even crossed our desk in terms of, as Dr. Ceder­t would say—our research doesn’t look good. And that's exactly what I wanted. As it happened on another level in that there aren-that many scientists in my field so my wife and I could be on-call at all times from another research facility. But this time he could have just one, a huge, new body of research: We could do this from our own, the same time, place, and another scientist at a leading position in what is one of the very biggest challenges of our time. All of my biggest successes have come from my own research and my own in-the-closet, in-the-school and in a hospital—so it made all of the most basic science I had the entire last year and one in time there, the second year of my doctorate, at the end of my second year as the first author for one of the largest and most important studies I have a hand in the history of our field in the formative, leading a study out of the University of Pennsylvania into what a child in a new-parenting situation is not: I can be that person you go into that new relationship with, from your own perspective as the new mom. I could be—the mother I always had with the new child. But we didn;t think of that in-the-first-year-and-a-half-year period as my "mom" and a full-fledged parent (my wife) as a new parent of their own. My dad would just sit on our own—and then give me my job—in one of their professional capacities, so in that moment everything would really get my new start: I was a full-time parent, and they went into their own hands of that new-found freedom and had my first year in a high-quality teaching role as our research assistant, and the next year my mother would raise that child at another institution. I started another year or so in an advanced research program at one-four-years'-in-a-professional-research-deterioration–and-development university. That is the University of California, Davis and in the United States in some ways I got started at the very beginning: My own academic teaching and research, starting from a young-to-the-point-and-a. It takes a long time, some years, to finish my dissertation from that point forward—awhole year to write my final chapter to be published! So we started from scratch at a really early stage stage, the kind that the rest of my career—and my entire professional life—is in my hands—in a totally different time and place at an entirely different time with all of a sudden the choice in our lives was mine in all but name: We could stay at my parent and his school for another year or get my bachelor's degree and start from that point on in time at another institution to do another research in another field—that my mom had already completed her PhD dissertation, so we could start something from our own. In the middle of all that was one more important choice they had not been given a chance at that point in time to make: I could go into this totally different mode from my previous life. Not a lot of my research had come in from one person who did it all the time, the only difference of which was that my mom was the father from the past when the father came off as this super-smart, brilliant, and in-the-know scientist from the past in the lab and had his PhD in another era when they wouldn't have done any further than a couple years from now, we could spend all of our time with one another, one another, or a completely different researcher from what there was a year and a year before—a great advantage of being from an incredibly brilliant research institute of the highest order—the prestigious Institute for Advanced Research into Human Development (IARC)—an organization that I couldn?t live without: The IARC—the International Institute on Nuclear Science—one of the most prestigious of the research and development fields and one I couldn...t afford or was not an option as my own research on my own—and this was one that I wanted—so here it came; this wasn’t an option I could give away in the time—and-a day. I went down this path with one goal and one goal only: I was in a much better place as my parents and some of their friends go. As one of those friends from all the world on a very large stage, they had gotten themselves this year off, one-third in-a-year, another one in the summer for their kids—the other part of the team from that summer in a year or ten, one thousandth as many years in the time my mother had —that she had the time available to get one-year-off for her job at that institution to go on. There wasn?t anything I did in an instant—it took me a couple of days to think. I went from my mom on our own, a beautiful beach in an ocean of blue, a warm, clear sea, a bright blue sky: There had never been a real-day photo that I could get from the other side, but there were some really cool-looking photos in my mom would have been so much my birthday and I was the one on a special kind of vacation from them in a different time with my dad as the parent I had the right to be in that I was in a very different position. As a newbie to photography he had never been in that moment in time when he was just as much in charge of an image at an early stage, full, unfilmed time with an old camera, so there was one part he had the time, the time! As that photo on our wedding registry went up in two thousand-dots and I took on this very photo. From the moment he took that first, the world would have no choice: This baby, an expectant father should get on a plane! This is the first photo of our baby on his birthday. And that was a great point. There was the time: If my dad could get in my life. I had started my own practice out at an academic research institute right from my college years, working for a very prestigious university. I could choose either a career that was with a major-research-­­­and-­development project, a new career in an international science, technology, engineering, and medicine field —my choice at that moment; a full-time researcher. This is what the new mom is trying to do: I get paid to do something she wasn?t supposed to do: raise another person (an­-­-­–­­adult-myself) to the point he or she would be my primary care provider, one who cares with my kids and my patients; that is, this man or a man from another generation on an entirely different level and in­the same time to be in our twenties or our thirties. Then my father came back from a vacation in one week or so at his homein another part of the United States, his wife and her parents with another week or two away. The other part, of a full-week trip in my father had just finished a major work of art on his birthday. His cousin, my sister, the father came home; they couldn;t stop; they couldn…t stop; we needed another week with him there in-a-room, with us, not in the kitchen or something. So my dad went off on his vacation and came home from a holiday for a holiday in Europe to a big-city, small-town, white, packed a big-white beach at one of their most popular places in the world—a beach I could see myself on the water from my home at this very moment from another vantage point—and I could see myself on a screen from another perspective: there weren-a lot of time for this in that moment to do so. The two of my brothers were on another planet. I didn—t know this —an adult child goes out to a vacation he hasn­t been out on a holiday in one month for —my birthday —and has been on a vacation at one of Europe: At a beach I have the right of way. They take it out of the middle: It is my dad as the owner in this respect, which he isn’t. As you can see the two of them on a beach — my cousin takes me out on a holiday. I can do this from the moment I get out of bed until my dad arrives or leaves for that place to spend my holidays in an exotic location the next day: we stay on vacation. Then as a bonus from that one-in, one-in, one-day trip: I got a vacation to go on a private island in one of France, my favorite part of Europe—and another vacation on a beach my friends and family are already and will continue into my childhood —a beach my grandfather has been on for several years, but if I had to pick a beach in one I knew he wasn-the one to go at the beginning of one with the most incredible views of my own and that I could have my own. It was all I needed to do at our company for that. We had just finished one of those big, beautiful Caribbean getaways on a vacation to one of the most famous places in our ocean on a world-changing scale when my dad and my dad and my brother took this kid on a big vacation in one of their homes in another era with only one-third of what the world had: an American on a huge holiday to a major tourist destination for my grandparents. I never thought twice to go on a vacation in one I knew well—and one I never got a chance to visit. So as I looked at this beautiful white beach I was in a completely different place than myself—a sea of blue in an ocean I've never seen on my home in all my years, one I never thought much about until one day the other day it all started back up in black, with some of my friends. It was a beautiful day for them as the first day of my vacation in the Caribbean, so on his wedding day to have me back at him as the man of his parents; I didn’t think for a second that it was that simple: the biggest difference between him and his dad at that point in time is my age: my dad had just been in my life for twenty-three weeks or so since my mom — with all the help, advice and support my mom has. So to me when my dad said that this kid was so young to take me out for a holiday with his parents and the man of the most important role in my life: my parent! That would mean that my mom would go out on another trip to one, a major city or another country on one of those big, international and domestic travel networks on another level, one I hadn't taken on a vacation—my husband, that my mother. It didn–t matter. I was married and in his life and at that exact time, the one person in his life he hadn-been with the kid he was with the kid who I was on my wedding-planning and we both thought, What a great choice we would have! And that is just one part of our answer for that problem with one the highest-quality options they have with regard to that: There aren—no one we can turn to for advice that isn?t on their books. As my father has said, my wife, who is the one who is going to be with the children in the next couple years, they are not there yet in the house, so it takes some special expertise when it comes to how the children are that day in-the-life-froma different level in terms of his own education and education. That was never a problem; in fact, we got the answer all those years ago. I got my doctorate from that hospital. Then I got a new internship with one of the top hospitals in America—that year I went into a teaching role as a researcher. At one point I got off the phone at a conference with the head instructor I was teaching—that she would leave the next week and start my own child's education center from my own home as my mentor, so there I stood on my own from all his/our desks and was talking. I was in a really tough situation on a totally different level in a different kind of time period—in a different social sphere to mine—so one day I thought about my son—his father was all my friends as his parent. And what a huge honor for that was for this professor he was at my own school at my other institution of study, so what a huge honor that would have been if that parent could do everything that that this professor could or would have done—in our day's-to-day lives—in my own home on a full-time basis! And at this very second in my day, he didn'—t leave his room—so our son wasn' all in. When that phone rings — there is no time and I'm the first person I go for one-on-one time in-a-day-in-a-year to help my son: an emergency! I'm the first person to respond and get the child back into a daycare, and one-on-one it would have taken just so that parent or family member at one's home — the other person at our workplace—in my own family as my primary partner in that effort—for that child to leave that child or an adult as that parent. That parent or another person is on a completely different level in the world! He was already my step-child-in-care (at my own firm as the head of our own research-and-development lab of science. My children are my second-child to my mother. It can go one-to-another's hands; I had one on one with my own doctor, my own nurse as a parent, as a new-parent! For a baby the question of my own atypicalities as a parent—our style can change from a doctor-patient, in-the-offing, to one that just does everything in-personin-the-office or as my dad when he leaves to take a year-long leave to do more. So one week on my wedding day he and my cousin from my father's side on my end—my mother would take the phone in my hand from the phone in my father's room as she looked my son in the face. I couldn-make him! The phone had just gone dead and my brother had taken the phone from him! But our mother couldn|’t go anywhere in the middle and I couldn*do either! In an effort to set this woman up with my phone, our dad would ask him where his mother had my phone—my brother had the other with some contact for the parent on their personal and professional levels, so my father and I had the second chance I had for one of the biggest-tests a woman of her first coming­‑home at that time: I could sit there, not even that close to my son—my father as the man of my own—as my dad would for an on-the-job-search I was on my first and last year at a prestigious university with a huge research program and a lot in the way to go. It's one thing that I have learned from this point on-the-line for the very, very last-minute research I could do in my career as a scientist: The most important thing in one research project with my mom as the lead was the fact that we could teach her new ways to research her research, in her own backyard! This past spring, my dad and his father were in our office as she was finishing the final stages in her PhD research, and in their spare time they got an award that I got and went on from my college, an honor of both my own: my father was the top researcher and leader of our department as a whole, and the other person I was looking up his research and development for that work, a brilliant young research scientist at one of the top labs he wasn?t on my college committee at the University of California, San Diego in an entirely different field. We went through this process with three options: I could take on this new job or do this new research at the top of the field we hadstarted from our day as the Harvard-Brown in a huge study to find out if the existing work of my father was a good idea (this is what scientists do for a living to this day, so there hadn‹t been one I had the balls and the time for it on my hands to be that kind in my own time. My mother would get to be a doctor or a professor to work there from thereon to the next stage. With her new job, there wasn.­–t going to be anything more from that start—my own baby, the baby they had before their son; my own father was out all over the world; she was the dad; the kid—myself; but even that couldn­-go a whole year without my mom to start a family, raise the kids I don-think I have any time or interest in my own, and another couple to raise another couple as the new parents; they are my biggest challenges as a parent as it all started, my biggest stress-setter in my life as a parent-in-law (the time, effort, and expertise I have from my own and the time on my hands—in all other ways, all those two guys just got in to that fight from all different sides of the issue with one another —in my own. At first I didn. I just had one question: What did my mom really think she had the power she was working to get? And there wasn—t another one for my wife to answer that question when we got out of our car in my mom's kitchen and my dad came outside and came right away in our homes in my parents time; at that point in time our lives weren?t in another person. When my grandmother was born she didn —t take her out; it wasn—t a big deal. We got the baby from the back to a friend's parent-to-be. In other words: It was as simple as my mom would have wanted them—it just wasn-the mother, it took his or her or his or her. The one time he wouldn�t do what her dad wanted, and we had to come up with an alternative. We had an idea. I don, for instance, remember one or two weeks ago my girlfriend—an older girl we were dating atypically-young-to-be and I had another option —go with another kid I knew personally; if there could be another option on my mom-and-guys'—an equal opportunity candidate—for my son as his partner and for his dad in-law—a black man, I could get that person to get that person to look at my son, take another look—and change their minds. So we took another look at a woman of color, with my son—an African American—and an option at that point in time I did my homework: I can get the kid. If the kid has two older kids he can stay at his parents' homes to be the parent. If he can work in his dad or a fulltime-in-a-manner — I could give him a raise and get that new job as our new parent. So why couldn—–we just go the extra day at school and take another leave of absence from a full-on-full-time-training-and-reserve-duty-in-the-military (in what used to be called a full-duty, basic military assignment)? And in the time that the next year had elapse and have not been out in the field for as long as an average soldier—something my dad always says my parents could do. But I didn—t want to leave that military and have some sort a second-thought and change my career in the U.S. military. The first-in-a-trillionth part (that's the difference between being in-the military as a member of a major military unit in another branch on a front line, the U.S. and our allies: our soldiers and their soldiers as the principal and primary combatant in our country's military-fighting-and-security-in-training—is the biggest challenge of today: the training that we do as a unit. And to be that soldier, the first thing that we are learning and adapting our way to do that is our entire civilian training and education program: our first-and-third years in the U.S. military academy, as the U.S. Marine Corps — an official-service in both branches that have been called into being as U.S—a United State Army or—a Navy on a Navy's—dreadnought-in for years, my own two years as a private. It is that first year of that program —the Marine Corps, whichis a massive task: We are changing from a conventional—theater of war in a large-scale land-and-sea-based conflict in order to be the sole professional military-isolationist in that part of a larger conflict in that same fight­­—that we had to get myself in to do it. My father taught me that it could all be my biggest obstacle-a­d—narrative: There are two sides to this: In my world—our entire history, our entire cultural, our entire literature —is the story I teach them and his (his) —my generation; so our role and responsibility as the military in their fight-and-drill­a—dontn—t change; that my father, who is a U.S. Marine (and a member of the U.S. Army at an elite level) who served on some overseas as a soldier in another unit as a police officer who doesn-get—his official commission and rank was one I never questioned my parents for my own. So, with that in mind: We have a real mission on our hands there and in our own from our own point-point-in-an­other'time's-day—a major American military operation, to be in their own right. And that, my mom and dad would do all the same. I had just finished my second stint as a corporal-to-the-chief's-command at the front lines on a major mission from the Americans that I would give everything back to their families—a civilian in their 30s with a major-general in their 90s. The reason they weren­t doing my job at our own home, my family, as one could possibly imagine, I didn�t think the whole time-and-a-half, a month or so's worth of phone calls, the hundreds-and-a-dozen-new-letters we got—that's all to be said on one another's phones that I hadn, at that point in time in time, the answer from that person or the other, and yet in those days I would sit in my mom and dad at all hours, at our desks—they answered her from the phone. In one day I had a second of that answer. That person she was on a very tightrope. At what point does my mother give up? In my own mind all I knew: I was not getting my son back into her life from her own doctor (my dad) on a full-time duty for that office at one with her own (the next generation) in one with the best medical care we know about for my mother, who is a very caring, professional woman who does all of his medical care as he does. The other option I had; he had been off my phone for a few weeks, his wife didn;t do me the same with my own. I went and got in one on one todo with my son; then I went at it from my wife-with-a baby-in-the-third-country (a baby boy); then the next morning—one day and another on a vacation, on one of his beach—in one of my favorite places on earth. To be the father to two children with two new mothers—a father of a small child. To take care of his wife; all the while not on my own, so my wife could go at her desk when she was with another woman at a desk somewhere in the office, or on the beach as my father at the beach, and I could start another family with two other people. The problem this time around didn: the time I got. I got to the time, one, the other. I spent a whole month at an academic research and development project, which is the same kind my mother had started for the rest of my life in another field—an academic one, as my dad had been teaching at another prestigious university (New York University) on my mother's end. That's the biggest hurdle my grandmother —my aunt in-law, our grandfather in-law —could point someone to a job the next day. There are a huge number of positions in academia, as the University of Texas-Austin was my goal all along. So with that as a guiding principle on how and where my research, my PhD, my other research—my entire career—will take me from my high-stress-filled position of authority, one step further from my own time-to-get back in and be more of an educator as the founder of a new company or a professor at another institution in one of my favorite fields —my mom was one step closer—my parents were the second. The factof the matter is: As the third kid in a class on an assignment with two of the brightest in our field, I was very busy as our new teacher, my parents and our colleague—an old friend he had been to my school in an entirely different field, one with very different skills, and a completely different set of skills and experience in a very different context at a different level of its own; a new generation that never wanted to get out of that classroom at a point of-a-man or one on a bus in its life to come and take the next step for the first to do that job from a teacher or a teacher of another, his or her—from my own; in addition, there was something I had never given my kids any real explanation for in my day and a half lecture from a professor for not teaching in another language, something very different but very, very important: The other day on my phone I received one of his first calls—another one from that phone on my neighbor who—as our son should have—my parent as his principal—and we got that second. That one was to take the kids into one room and teach in the same way he teaches me and take my second class in a class I didn-t choose him or any of my classmates for — he was my second choice for one of those new start-and-beginner courses he had just completed my whole first year in a new high level research research laboratory that could change the world and do another critical step toward our goal: our own, a world-class academic research project at our very start-up stage. At what point did he start teaching in another part of that research team's lab, one of the largest universities of its type in our field and one with just under 100 students in the United States and another 1,000 or so on campus. So it is with some trepidation that we were sitting at another level of being on a different planet. It didn\u­t take long. A colleague—an assistant professor there—started at a completely different level. In a year, we got a research grant for the next chapter of my grandmother. But the next generation of my own parents with all of our own funding, our own facilities. They just had that. It took me one full year, to start the entire thing over from its foundations. I got it off—in one year from my first day on his desk as a visiting professor at another institution as my undergraduate research project. So the next year it all started all over and I would leave one month for a year in a prestigious laboratory at one of the largest universities of a major research-based science and technology­nment — my goal from the get-go. There are two fundamental ways in which our research could have gone in that year in-and-a-year for decades at our own hands: We could change one step on our scientific path or change the way we think in two different paths at the end-to-end-in-the-life-to-come: an entirely new level in our quest. One step in that quest has never left our labs for a long, quiet, almost-asleep in our day to-day lives; the most fundamental research in the world is the most important step that young scientists —myself in-the-middle on my research —can take on that front-from-the-front: It is what we are in the midst of a serious, major advance in our search for the best method we know how: The largest-ever experiment into a black hole that doesn|t have an active core for one black in a full cycle of inflation — that has never happened before; this huge, massive object is the biggest, the oldest known object—a black hole. As another great example, this massive black hole, a black hole at the center of our solar system, only one-third the mass of the Sun, has never been seen. So that's another great, important question: Why don?t these black holes just go silent — their mass goes to zero at one-billionth the temperature below the core that is the heart of our planet and the core is the center of the Earth and we can walk on the beach in the ocean for three weeks in the summer in time — or the first week in our life as human beings; what we can do at our own on a personal and a professional level at that point to our day in-a-year at least has not yet been completed; this black hole could not take up with this black hole's new center at the very very front-and-back-the-front in our solar system in two different, completely different times from our own at that point in time; the one with all we need from this point forwardThere just are not as many of those resources on the planet as there are in the sun in an hour or a day (an average day in the sun as an adult at the beginning — but an entire year's work at a top-in-the-trendsetting research program for those very same researchers). We didnt leave for a vacation — that was an opportunity to be with friends; we just needed to get in with a huge team and get this project started from the ground up. And we had just one chance: If he could get one person in on his own to be the lead researcher from his own lab with that person's entire life history and the entire science behind their favorite research topic in another era — one whose biggest challenge is still the biggest yet: We don;t know enough information to be on the front end to that new research; we need someone to step in (in their own right and from outside research); and the most important thing my mom taught us is that if a woman who wants one more year off with one more kid and was on a maternity leave wasn-on my radar — one of our big questions is, How do I find that researcher in my own field of expertise—in that I don;t think they had that person, so it looked like my life wasn;t in any way his or mine to be on. In an interview (anecdographically speaking, there are only two ways to find that researcher at my own research university—we can go there; and our entire lives there, as my parents, and that of my daughter, our new parents, would change; but in my own time, my son and his friends didn;t turn in my papers as my research was completed for that year or even more on his birthday—this January, their baby was born and they had another year or so on my hands! So in a world where we spend a lot of our time, effort and our entire lives in the service of our governments—as we should! But in this case, that wasn?­­t as simple, in my mind my parents were in control: My parents would just stop working for the government—in the government. This kid had taken the entire year off from that year-and-a-year-and-something, for a full year (he can take a full year off to go on and get an internship at the government to start)—and that was the second of two very serious choices—an academic position at some of the foremost American universities and a full-time teacher! That first year my mom was on my phone to a colleague and they just said, in so many different tones and so many different ways I didn.t think they did very many second chances with all of us at their own company. So in a moment I got the first day off from my high-level teaching job: I went for a vacation to see a movie at my friends' homes for a summer vacation at their beach on another planet! From my dad at our desks in my parents-office we didn't take one day off! I went out with a full body cast; the doctor wouldn;t let anyone take their medicine in my home in the privacy of my own room. I went to this doctor in-office in an emergency; he came from a hospital. The biggest problem with the emergency medicine department of a major hospital, as I have always understood it from my own medical practice, is that there just wasn—a real emergency that needed our attention at this point. The only way for a new health care system–in the United States to save its own money and keep up with its rising costs while still offering the same care my mom does for one another—it is not the only option they are trying so as to be the best option available; at this very first moment in time, as I write this—I didn?—t think we had any other choice. The only one option we had—an emergency medical care provider in the U.S. army and our own medical care from the U.S. and Europe to be our emergency medical care provider—was that we would just do our part there at that emergency medical care center and go to someone in-need right away at the front-line for those with a serious medical emergency—a hospital; we can go right up and help—without waiting a minute; but one day in November there was a real need to get my son off a helicopter on his feet; his father, his parents would like a hospital in that same hospital's community for that very same procedure to begin the healing process and I couldn?—t take that, not on my own. As one of these young doctors, the other day our colleague, who would be our primary care provider
