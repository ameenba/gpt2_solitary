and I was never given my own. And that was my biggest problem. Because of my family, I would always be the outsider. My mother was my primary authority, and in those days, when someone tried to stop the revolution, it was the woman in your life who was the one who was the biggest power. And she just didn’t listen. If anything, I was the outsider. I knew right away that there wasn’t anything new under the sun—nothing new to try. I knew what to do. I was always the kid outside, playing with his sisters and his grandmother. Everything else in my life was the same. The people I knew were the same. They had been through this too many times, and they knew that there was a way forward. The only thing I wasn’t good at was dealing with change. When I had a chance, I took a risk, and that was to start my business in this small, one-room grocery store in this little one-room store selling only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with our own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I was not doing that because our mother and father were the biggest food-service executives in this country. I knew better. I knew the truth, and I knew I couldn’t live for it. It would have been so easy, right at the start, for us to stick with traditional foods, stick with our way of life, and take another path, to some third world country where everyone’s eating from a jar of peanut butter and jelly every morning! There would have been no peanut butter in our morning milk—no milk in my coffee—and we’d be back home in Africa for our millet and our kimchi—the most nutritious food out there. We didn’t want to be anything else. In our house, every meal on the family table was filled by one large plate of peanut and kummi, our version —the same thing everyone else was. But here at home, we would drink just four or five glasses of water a day, which was an enormous amount of water; you’d have to be on the water during the day, and you’d be swimming all night—and at night on the beach, you’d have to drink that. But here at home, we were all in a state of total immersion. If we wanted to drink, we’d have to buy bottled water. It was the only water available in our community, so we were on our own: Every morning we’d drink a glass of water and come home to clean the house and put our dogs to bed. Every evening we’d go and take our dogs for a walk, and they’d come running up to us and start running after me. “Hey, you are my favorite dog. Please keep your dogs.” My wife took them on a walk. I wasn’t there—because we were at work. I wasnít allowed to be away from my house that whole time while my father worked the phones at CitiWorld to find more American jobs. So my favorite dog was back with us. My wife and I walked. For some reason, my dogs loved being with their dad—they’d jump up, run off and run right around us in the yard. It was a perfect day in the park, a wonderful day. We watched the whole thing on TV, everything on a big flat screen. My wife had brought to the park a little panda. It was going to be one of those days, all of us together for our favorite thing in the world. For my part—and this was my first time ever playing with the panda—I was totally out of control, throwing myself at his feet and running up and down like there was no tomorrow, so I was so tired from the whole thing, I couldn’t do anything. And for my last hour playing with the panda, I was out of it. But the moment I was done playing with the panda with our mom, I got my mom to hang out with the panda again. So we sat and talked, hanging out the whole day, and the first thing she said to me was, “I hope he doesn’t kill someone. That person might be able to kill a friend.” I didn’t believe her that at the time, and I never believed that she, either. I wasn’t in control. I wasn’t a superhero. But I had this little moment on the screen of a kid just being an amazing human being, and all of a sudden, that part was gone. I didn’t understand why, because the thing about himthat I knew from the first day that he was going to be great. This kid was a superhero. He could run fast for people, too. He was a great athlete. But when someone came along who was so gifted at things he would never learn that he would be a genius, he would be a different person—in my mind, a better person. Because I knew him so well from the moment that first day, to the end of our friendship, from when he came home from prison to when he left to go to a better life. It was a lifetime. Then there was this one moment I wanted to be a father in my family. It had to be, and then I knew something was wrong. It was my brother, my nephew. I remember looking around at our family, and it wasn’t all that much different from my other children; my brothers-in-law were good, decent, loving people; my cousin and his cousin were two of the nicest, most loving people you would ever meet; my brother and his cousin went to church regularly, but none of our church friends had ever met them at any point in their lives; my mother was a pretty decent person—not a perfect person by any means. But my brother was a total stranger to them in that instant, a completely different person from any of us. All of a sudden, this one moment, this one moment—all of a sudden, for the first time in my life, someone was the center of the family on a daily basis. And I wasn’t going anywhere. I didn’t want to move on—that was not an option at that point in time. I was going to live my life, to raise my kids, to care for them all my life, no matter what. I didn’t want them; in fact, I was the only person left who really knew how to make an extended family—the kind that you could raise with that one little brother. I could keep them, and my children could live with them as long as they wanted. “But,’ the other family is not like the one where you’re on the outside looking in; not like the one where your whole life is a war between your two greatest rivals, like a great power versus a tiny country; the other family’s all-encompassing conflict is the conflict of your childhood—a war to the day, or a war to the year—a war to the grave. There’s more to life than this. My dad had just finished watching his cousin and nephew go off and go be heroes while my aunt had been in the hospital recovering from an assault on her back—and a child of war. My sister and I had been through a lot. But as the years went by, the constant pressure got to us—and our friends in the military, too. My mother was in a great depression; my brother felt like life was not going well at work today. He missed being in my brother’s life. I found the time on weekends with our brother and his mom to be with my younger brother and my cousin for the holidays. I spent a lot of my childhood with the cousins, and the whole time they were my friends—and they became my best friends—my life was full of good times, all the time. They’d ask me everything, everything. “I am a boy! Do you understand what a boy means to a boy?” “No. A girl cannot be a man! You’re a girl!” —The day before Christmas my mom gave birth to my daughter, a girl. She was so excited to give birth to a girl that one Sunday morning she gave a baby a bath: and then in another, she’d gone to her friend’s house for an evening with friends, had a glass of wine for her, walked out from a closed shop and gone to bed. But that was my mother. That was everything about my mom. She was the only woman in my life, in my family, around my cousin and all the other people in my life. I knew what a boy meant for her when there was an opportunity to do it, but I didn’t dare ask. My dad said that he didn’t want me to be with this girl; there weren’t the boys to be men, either. And so I stayed on the sidelines for the most part, watching my mom and the baby grow into adults, and then my cousin grew a beard and came along and the day was off for me. But when it came time to make my parents choose one or the other, it was my mom. She was the man ofthe house, always there for the kids. There was no way in hell that two straight, white-skinned, middle-aged men from the Midwest could have made a relationship work. So that was that. But then something happened the next day that didn’t get me over. It ended up that the guy I liked, the guy I loved, our new friend “was not the way he was portrayed in the news, and the people of America, they thought we’d gone far enough. This was not the America. This was not the America where you could look in the eyes and say, “We’ve been through this before. Let me tell you one thing. It doesn’t hurt me, I never got bullied.” My parents were the most supportive people I know. In fact, my mom got the hell out of there. My dad became a private detective, and this was the life he was living. He would have a good hour with me, and I’d have another hour with him. They would discuss the odd things my mom’s not-so-secret service had told the White House about me in the past. I had no other life in my life. The only time we’came out to dinner during my school years was to eat with them. My mom invited me and my dad to visit the house and hang out for a while. My big brother came and he too was a big, strong kid, and there was a lot with his dad. It was an easy dinner, with him in a white shirt and white pants, a white tie, and a white tie. As much as anything it was an opportunity for them to talk, to be with another kid, a kid they knew from the streets, a kid who did the same thing all over again. And in my mother’s case, that kid came out. I remember that meal. I’ve never had an opportunity to eat that many plates of food from my mom because, as much as my mom was a perfectionist when it came down to the kitchen, that’s the job of a chef. You were not supposed to have more than one dish for every person in the family in a given day. You’d pick one for one particular person to cook, and for someone else the next day your whole family would have the same dish (it was a dinner party). It was the ultimate family reunion. My mom and the man who became our chef, a beautiful Indian from India that would have been my godfather, a chef from India, a beautiful Pakistani cook who was my great aunt. We’d have a big dinner, with everything we could eat. We’d have chicken tikka masala on rice in my mom’s kitchen, steamed blackberries and strawberries, green peas and potatoes, lots of vegetables (a whole basket of them), and an endless supply of ketchup, as well as some delicious Indian-made food that everyone would have had. I remember the special moment when the dinner was served and we all got to try the meal before it was over. And after it was over—that whole thing that everyone had been eating every night—my mom went into the kitchen and made us an extra batch of ketchup to go, and I felt my stomach expand. A few minutes later, her back came to her, and it was time to finish. We’d have another batch. I was going to be ready. In front of the family, in front of a live audience, my mom cooked as if it was her regular job, and she was fantastic. I didn’t understand why at that moment that was wrong. But even though that moment was a terrible moment for me, it’s not the only thing I remember. I saw things that I wasn’t allowed to see. I heard things that I wasn’t allowed to hear. My friends, my dad, my entire world, changed for the better. I was very fortunate in that moment to have that woman on my shoulder. I learned. It was a great experience for me, for my family, for a country that was very different from what it was. I learned about how powerful women are. You don’t grow up like that; my mom was always the most inspiring role model in my life. That wasn’t the way things happened. We got along and I learned how important family matters and that. My dad, who was the president, saw something that wasn’t always being shown from the outside: the way the government was treating women. The President asked his Cabinet and the White House to make a change. The president was on board. That changed everything. He stood up tohis Cabinet and his White House for the first time in years, and they stood behind him. The only people at odds from the first year of my father being in office were a few people in his family. I learned a few things from him. The first big thing he did was give us a chance. I started a day early—I got up as late as possible. Everyone packed up their cars on the front lot. I took his car and his first car, a white Mercedes S550. The whole street got a little dirt. By the time morning came, I was already packed in; the whole street, including the street that our grandparents had lived in their entire lives. My grandmother was the first person to greet me. She had a little black-and-white photograph of us, just my dad, smiling warmly. She didn’t look happy on the outside. On the inside, it was so dark inside there was little light coming through. My dad took my mother and me for breakfast. We’had a big bowl of French toast and I ate some omelets at the table. My mom had a plate of eggs and a bowl of soup. As far as I knew, this was when we became the first people to use that special, organic, whole food from our local produce factory. I never thought that I’d ever grow up on that farm. I never thought that anyone would go through the trouble of growing, butchering and eating it all by themselves. It was my first taste of the world. I started learning how to make my mother, who would be the first one to tell the story of how the farm grew into a thriving business for the rest of her life, make a very simple decision: Go to college. My mom made a very good decision. She had always wanted me to go to college. To study English in a college. So, after my parents got divorced she took my sister and my sister in law, and my sister-in-law, my sister-in-law's sister-in-law, and a bunch of my cousins down to the city, and they set up a college there. We had some money saved up at my father’s job, my dad’s car, my sister and my cousin's house in Bergen, their old house. So they paid, all the way up to the roof, and to stay there for four weeks. My mom stayed in a one-room house on the outskirts of town. I spent the first three or four nights there hanging out in the yard in our backyard. Everyone in the house cooked their own food all the time. My mom cooked, too, but my mom loved cooking. There was no TV in our house to watch, not even the old black-and-white shows on the station. I would see her cooking, sitting in the kitchen. It was as though she was a modern-day Martha Stewart. There was never any TV before, and no TV was coming into our house to get her cooking or anything else, just me and her. We went to the house. My mom got out the frying pan and started. She came in with the most incredible green salad: The vegetable garden—there’s not a vegetable on this garden I would not eat for breakfast. It had a nice, green texture, which I’d never seen before. It was just a bunch of stems, a bunch of stems. I loved it. I was in the kitchen for two hours in a heat-stunting sun when I saw something special: A giant carrot. I’d never had a carrot before. I was a big boy. My mom was a super woman. I wasn’t the biggest boy in the kitchen. But that carrot was so good. I don’t remember the whole recipe. It was all about the texture of the flesh. She was the best cook I ever had. I would never have eaten a carrot or a celery root the way my mom did. The only time that I didn’t like anything she cooked, she’d let me have her back. We’d walk down and Ill sit and wait for her to bring the most amazing dish of noodles or pasta. It never came. No sauce. No bread. Nothing. Just the noodles. And then she’d add some more vegetables in. I had never had a dish like it at home. It was always something new and fresh. Every time I ate a bowl of it, it was a new day, new thing to try. Then a bowl of it would go out the side door, and I wouldn’t come back. In college, we got the Ramen Ritz —I’d get two dozen servings of the ramen in a lunch, and for every one of those I got in the pot one pot of soup, another pot of Chinese. That was it: that was a pot of soup all the time for the whole day. You’d have your dinner, sit in the living room, and eat your soup. By then I had learned not to be in a rush. Instead, what would happen if I’d get another bowl of soup for my lunch or dinner was that all the time I’d be running around, just having some fun. It’d be good food and something to do, but at the same time not really work at all. It was the perfect combination. But I learned in a few months, as time went on, that I wasn’t that much of a time-waster. If I got dinner that late in the evening, maybe I was a little too late. If I got soup the next morning, maybe it was time to go. On a few occasions a few hours later my lunch was still not done and I didn’t get another bowl of it. The soup was still on the counter, the noodles still cooking under the broiler, still warm, still hot. “That’s what it feels like to get all the time of your life, but it’s only a minute” “toke,” I said. “How many minutes would it be?” The waitress got off and walked me through one final thing. They didn’t call it a nap for the longest time. But in a few hours it’ll be time to get up and leave and we’d run a little errand. For the next few hours we wandered through the city. We would get off work at 4, we’d go down to the back streets and spend the night. “This place is so much better than we thought it was.” We would go back for dinner and get up early the next morning to go walk the neighborhood, take some walks back in time, go eat some street food at a place called La Patrie. There was nothing on that menu that was new. It was all just the same old, basic, stuff. And it was delicious. We spent the whole week in Leipzig, and at one point it was time for us to go to my uncle in Nuremberg, the capital of the German empire. One Thursday morning, it was a beautiful, calm day, and Id be up. I had a really easy class of the G.A.A., and in the class the teachers all got together and they came up with the best way to teach a G.A.A.B. — a set of skills, all based on a specific problem. They came up with how to take a pencil and write down some numbers, and then they showed me a photo of the first grade class I went to elementary school with. It was the year before the Berlin Wall—and the only way to read was to sit in the front of my class and read the history books. The books would tell all the stories, and so did the people they liked—the great, old-man-power of the Nazis. It was my first real taste of freedom, of growing up in a free country. But what made everything so great was that everyone had that incredible blend of freedom—freedom of speech—and of love—in a way that could not be translated to another culture, another culture. As a black kid in that class, I felt like I was the only black kid there at all. My mom would be at home—working in her garden or on the beach, her kids were in the yard—and she would be back in her own time. There was some family time, but I was left out all the time. That year at home, I’d run into the black family in the kitchen and they’d come over. “I’ve been waiting all year. It’s been a long time.” “No, it’s not. We were waiting.” I took my father and my sister. We got into a big family car. On the way there, we stopped off, and my dad got out and took his mother and my sister in for lunch. “It has been awhile since I have had that. For the holidays, at least.” He’d brought her this wonderful thing he’d made at home at a little shop called Jell-O. It was a jelly roll that she could make at home. She got me this bowlof this really nice jelly that you could wrap up and give to someone, right there in their kitchen, and it was super creamy and it was great for making these, so much—the flavor of my father in law, the taste of my father in heaven. It didn’t taste like anything, but we’d always been so close that I didn’t think that mattered. But the moment I saw my mom have one in the kitchen, I knew I couldn’t be around here to make those things at home. All they needed was me to walk up and tell them. For the first time in my life, I wanted, truly wanted to be like my dad. I wanted him to give his children back the kind things he’d given them from birth, in exchange for them getting back with him in times of need. At my wedding, the next day, she took a job at the local McDonald’s for a couple of weeks. A short time later, she came back, and that was it. Everything was back to normal at home. We got along great all around this time, the family was great, but she was always there. She came to my parents and thanked them for making me a million bucks. She thanked them for giving me a second chance at a very difficult life. She had one question. When I was at home sick, I could call my grandma, but my mom wasn’t with her—no matter how much time you had with my parents to spend with Mom, you were in a relationship with your mother. My mom was like, “Why don’t you have someone visit your grandmother?” I was completely speechless for a couple of seconds, but then I’d tell her. A year later, my grandfather came down and made the long journey back from the Soviet Union with us. It wasn’t a moment too soon for my mom, who’d been through the same thing with my father-in-law—my dad came back to see her when it happened. “It is never easy for your parents to leave you. The country of Israel would have the biggest problem, and there would be no end to apartheid in South Africa. You have to find a way: Either accept that the Jewish people are here. Or, at least, you can take the land, which my mother never did, nor will ever, ever want you to have. What will it be?” So, my mother went to live with her parents on a large estate next to an agricultural estate. I was born in the house with my brother and my younger brother-in-law. The house wasn’t large, but the whole of the lawn was, a perfect tenor saxophone patch, which my father was so fond of playing in the street, that all my cousins and my younger brothers, who were of Jewish descent, would come over whenever he was in town. I’d go play in the yard for them, or hang out in my grandmother’s garden, or hang out on the front porch. It was great and it was perfect. But what I didn’t understand at first was that at the moment when my parents left, my mother would take over, and my dad would take the place of them. My dad became a police officer. My father became a professor. We—d stay in touch for the most part and say our prayers together, but at some point my dad would get in a heated argument and my mom would have to intervene. We’d become friends in a way I never had a friend group; and for the most part, we stayed friends. Then one Sunday, my grandmother went to meet with a rabbi in Jerusalem. The rabbi’s office was only a little more than an hour away. My grandmother and the woman who would become my mother-in-law, a priest of the Jewish church of Jerusalem, would meet in the synagogue. We’d walk around the block together. I could tell they were getting along great. There was a woman's room in my grandma’s house, which was now converted into a women’s prayer room. We went up to the second floor and the main altar. I was the rabbi. I gave a talk in my mom’s synagogue—which meant it would never get converted into a women’s congregation. Now I had a place that was a woman’s prayer room, an area for prayer, as well. In my time with her, my mom gave me a tremendous amount of confidence. Even to this day, you don’t believe what some people around you tell you. There aremany young men who don’t want girls. They tell you that because of patriarchy. There are a lot of men who don’t want to learn men’ languages; don’t have the same interests in the sciences as the men in their countries; don�t be involved in the way the men of their countries are; don’t respect women. These men don’t want women around them at all times. They get their power and their status and their money through men like [my mom] who are great, great men, great fathers to their children. My mom never doubted that if you had an opportunity it would be a great thing for you—that no matter what you did, there was always a chance at the top—and you’d be amazing. She’d tell you all along. But that didn’t work out for me. So she gave me a second chance—and then another. She gave me another chance at it, and the second time I didn’t like it or it didn’t work out, I told her what she did was one of those things—and if it wasn’t what my life had always been all about, I’d be dead. And so I was on the outside, fighting my way back in in. At least that way she knew what my problem was. I learned that every time I was going through some of our issues, she would just sit me down and give me a couple of lines and say, “I’love you.” So as I grew and had a few years in the limelight on my own, I figured that if she could get in touch with her roots, she would have one of those moments. There would be some hope. There would be some lightness. But one year my mother called me and asked me to come and take a look. She told me that we’t’d been through a terrible trial—this woman had been found guilty of something. There were still a number of things we were trying to get done. I wasn’t the ideal man for the job. My parents could be my best friends, but there wasn’t much we could do. What I didn’t know, though, was that our trial hadn’t ended yet. We were still fighting the same trial. The jury on that one had been hung. So, after a couple of months it found this woman not guilty. The judge had overturned her guilt on certain facts; the prosecution had not argued that at all. For the most part they had agreed with the prosecutor that they found her morally unsuitably evil. This could have ended that. A jury had already convicted this woman of rape. The jury had convicted on some other thing, like a child pornography charge. But my mom couldn’t have had that, couldn’t have had one of those days where she went on TV and accused the world of being a bunch of perjurers, and people would have been confused; people would have been mad—people would have been angry. But that week after the trial I didn’t get that kind of anger. I didnt feel the need to defend myself. I didn’t need her to say anything; my mother wouldn’t defend something like that. My father had all his cards out and didn’t even bother talking to me about some of the other things in my life; what I was accused of doing, the way my mother had been accused of doing, she was out on my life—all of his financial dealings, his sex lives, my life. His parents would have been outraged. In my mind, from that moment on, they were like, Don’t fight these situations out in a court system where no one will ever defend you against a woman because you’d be making this woman feel as though she was second-class citizens. And so, instead, I was living in an alternative: There’s a women’s center in my town and I can go and play basketball with the women there, or I can go home, go with the men, and play with a man who is a man and take a course on how best to treat women like men are supposed to treat women. Because, really—what woman wouldn’t be happy to have a man like that as their dad? He wasn’t that man. So I wasn’t. I grew up on my own and spent a lot of time playing with toys: toys for me to play with, for him for me, a whole lot of toys for him to play with, a Barbie doll for him, and Iwould go sit here, or I would play with a stuffed pig. I couldn ’t be away from him because he just wasn’t spending his time with us. He’d been up all night, he never came home. If I thought we would ever get along on the field, I would have gone out and found a friend on the street with a new toy, just like that. Instead I did all the thinking of all the time at home in a tiny bedroom, and I didn’t have that much fun.”” I loved it. It was fun. A guy like Ben, he knew how to put his own spin on it every day: He got up and had breakfast to finish some music in the morning; he had a half-hour or a full day to play a guitar for a band; a whole month to study for his high school English exam that morning; all the music that went into that morning; for a whole month he was playing guitar in a band in a studio in Berlin. I loved it. He’d get up and study to the music and play a few songs before going through the exam. Then he went off and bought music from some other guy who had done it before him, and he was off. His guitar playing was better, his voice stronger, his voice was better than everyone else’s. It went from that day to this to the day when a friend of his invited us to play at one of the great festivals in Germany, a festival called Berghain. That festival was one of the greatest musical experiences of my life. We played for several days in one of those huge fields, with all the plants, all the grass, you could stand next to them, and it was just me and that giant plant. There were no animals on the grass. You couldn’t just sit anywhere next to a man to play with his plants. There was no such thing as a man in a woman’s man’s body on the grass; there was just the man next to a woman to play with his plants. It was just a huge area in the middle of nowhere. The only time I saw people on the grass was in the heat of the summer months, and it was amazing. We’d be sitting there, in that field, waiting for the sun to go down and for the sun to come up. It was so gorgeous; all the grass was covered in that amazing red, red-orange, and yellow color. I couldn’t wait to go out and play in the sun to see what it looked like when it was still red and orange-red and yellow in the summer and now the grass was a beautiful shade of pink and purple. It was very nice and relaxing because everyone was just sitting there in all sunshine, and when the sun comes out it brings an incredible amount of color to the grass and everything else. But I remember that day so well. The sun was shining in my face; my eyes were watering. I stood there with these beautiful, vibrant brown-and-gray-skinned ladies and some guy from a different tribe, he brought a big red stick and he was trying to beat me and was about to kill me, but I wasn’t having that. At least, I wasn’t trying to kill them. I started dancing! I was dancing in the sun. It’s not really that much of a secret: At least in African cultures dancing in the sun is almost always a thing of honor. Every woman we saw in the village was a stripper. Every man we saw was a performer in front of a dancing troupe. The dancers were so young; the men were in their 20s—I was in my 30s—but it was always like we were in an era of disco. If I wasn’t dancing at some nightclub right away I would not have continued to dance outside at one time for another hour. But because in the village there was a club and a dance floor and all kinds of other fun things to do you couldn’t leave that room and go outside, so, you had to stay inside. The dance floor was the same old dance floor: There was one set and then a full circle, the music was blasting, and then—from the time people got out of bed until the wee hours of the morning. At one point I had to find a guy to hang out with all day. At other times it would be a DJ playing all night; I’d have a full DJ set playing for two hours. My father never told me anything about that other-worldy scene outside the village or going dancing. He was my father and I was my son, but he had a certain set of ruleswith regards to my time with him, as well as every other aspect of my life. At least I think my Dad respected me. Even the people he treated like dirt for the most part treated me as his family. The only times he would tell me anything about the village, it wasn�t to do with the children he was with, or how they were treated. When we went on some special family vacations, he would take us by the hand and lead us through the village, talking about the history, the culture, everything there. I did not have much of a choice about that, really. At least the most important thing was that the people of my village were so nice, so kind and so kind to the people of my country. But at that age and in that place I did not have any of those. As a result, I was the only child of a woman my mother had married off to a man who had killed hundreds of men. It made the whole thing very strange. For some reason it was in the middle of a war: this man was trying to kill me, and it was a war the entire world knew he was participating in. I was the child of two people who had been through their share of that war in one way or another. At the end of one of those wars, my mother took her husband to see a war movie. I can remember the theater lights. I can remember the sound of the guns. There were no bombs, no rockets. Just this big, white house and all the people from all around the world. The soundtrack was incredible, and this man was playing the part of Generalissimo. They were playing a movie called Aung San Suu Kyi, and he was a real hero. I got a special present from my uncle. I got this big black flag of the United States of America. I got a pair of red boots. I got some kind of American flag. I got my father and my younger sister, my mother to come out to see it. I took my mother's shoes. I took my father's red baseball cap. And I got all of our friends, including my uncle, to come over. They were the only people in the village I could see myself. I looked up at the black flag on the wall and at the American flag on the street. My mom looked up at the flag and was a little stunned. Then she smiled at me and turned away, took out a pen and started sketching in her mother's handwriting. My dad drew a picture of me in a red, white and blue striped shirt and a green blanket. Then he sketched the American flag on the wall in gold. Then he drew the American flag on two black-and-white striped T-shirts—that was the colors of freedom! The American flag. They were the colors of freedom everywhere I looked! In the village, everyone wore red T-shirts and green blankets. I had blue, yellow and red T-shirts on all the time. In the city, people wore black. In the streets, people wore red. I had red sneakers, red shirts, red socks, red slippers. If it was a black person's house, they had a red entryway. My mom would hang her favorite song on the wall. When a black person left, her mother would walk up and play it for her children: We Are Family (She sang it before all of that). She would come out and play, and one of her daughters would walk in and start crying and begging her to sing while she did. She did—and I couldn�t stop watching—the entire time. My mother never once turned away from the children, the children who were so much the reason I was alive. No matter who had done this or that terrible crime. She was the person who would do everything in her power to protect her children and keep them safe on the other end. This had nothing to do with any race. This was me, this family, and here in America I was a person of color who was in the minority. So I knew what race was and what race didn�t be—and if this situation ever escalated to a point where it had to be changed. I knew from the get-go that I couldn�t be that white person in America. And after what had happened to my mom, I knew that I couldn�t be the white person in America anymore. I learned that I could succeed just as well as I could fail. The next day my grandfather called and said he couldn�t go to America to take my place. He had decided to take our son, and so my mother took a step closer to a world of her own. It was something we had wanted for a long time, even since they found a baby girl ontheir doorstep with their cousin. This time, they really took the time and did the research, and it wasn’t some weird, random chance pregnancy has. This time, she came to the realization that she could take that risk—and if it meant that she could lose one of her children or lose another family member in the process she had, that was her choice. So here she was, my mom, the woman who wanted to do something about these horrific acts, who had made so much time, effort, and her whole life for it, standing behind it. This was it—this was my chance. I knew all along that I would be the next victim. And the moment the cops showed up, I knew that I wouldn’t be taking this for granted. I knew who the real killers were: the people who knew what they were doing and did it in a way that would have a profound impact on them. It wasn’t that long ago my mom was a full-time therapist—and that is what this job was all about. But this woman was a man with an interest in helping people, and I was just like them. This woman knew about what happened. For the first time in my life it felt like the world was a little bit smaller than it was before. We had our fair share of crime. We had our fair share of drug addiction. But the only problem I had with the people I grew up with on the streets wasn’t that I was like, I don’t care if I'm a criminal or not. It just was who they were . . . and I would rather live in a society where that was their reality than in a society that tried to create my version of that. That and I had a great, amazing, funny, friendly and caring mother, a great, funny, funny, loving father—so much that I’d never change. My mother made it clear that if I wanted a better future, if I wanted my children to be like me in every way, if she wanted her kids to grow up in an environment that would not allow them to be bullied or abused, if I needed that in them to feel safe, if I needed the help that my dad was always there for me—she’d give it. I was an only child from a broken home. I grew up without any of those things, and my mom said, “What can you do?” I took the LSAT, my first chance at a university. I took the SAT—two separate tests, for the first time, that I was guaranteed one of. I took my SAT to get my transcript back. I took the ACT—the English language test, which is a pretty good test of English—to get my college transcript back. I took the ACT to get my diploma. There was never any doubt about who I was at that point in time. I was the only black kid in that class. I was the only kid in the school with a yellow ribbon in our school. I was in the music program, in the dance troupe where no girl would dance—we had to dress up in white clothes, or we had to dance for other groups. Every Sunday night we would walk home, I would dance. It would be my dad’s favorite, that old Disney film, where all the black people dance and everybody looks like they are all dancing, and then in the movie I was the Black Guy, and you had to play as him. I was really into that film; that was my first taste of being black in America; at least at that point, for my entire life in this little town in Africa, that was how everyone was. This was just my one chance. So many people I remember from that era of going to school with no black classmates, we’d go to the mall and go buy a bunch of candy, some candy from a toy store. I was the only one on my own; for the first time in my life I was the only black person walking around the block and seeing what everyone’s doing. The first time my mom let us use the park for an outdoor dance class. Everyone danced around the park and everyone was all in a group. We’d sing, people would run after each other. Everyone was dancing in the streets of Blantyre, some people were running, others were walking along a track. I remember my mom walking by while everyone was all dancing. Then, at the end, we’d sit at the kitchen table where we’mcedished, which involved us all getting together in one room for the first time in my life. I was the center of attention, with the boys, the girls, the two white ladies in the middle.The white girls in particular — their favorite activities were dancing in the street, playing in the yard, hanging out in the courtyard. I was the star. “Oh.” “Whoa, man’‏” It was a beautiful day in America. People were sunbathing in the beachfront. People were playing in the street. “I’m sorry. It all seemed so nice before. I was like, I’had always wanted a beach. I took that whole time to build my sandcastle, so it wouldn’t ever be like the one with the coconut trees. It would be the whole house, with a tree, a beach in the middle. Then I went back home, built my sandcastle. I took my first job: I was in a sand pit. We got to work every day. “This is what you’re all going to do, when the sand goes up in the sand?’ I’d walk around, taking pictures of it, trying to figure out how to make the sand bounce like the sand in Brazil. I went through my first year at home in Mlungisi. My mom bought me a toy. It was an old toy, a giant toy from the '60s. I couldn’t play with it, not really. But I was the only boy in a group that had a really big toy. I would go pick it up. “This toy is sooo cute.” “It wasn’t?” ‹No.” ‹What happened?” ‹I took it upon myself to make the best toy in the world.” No, no. I didn’t. I took back what my parents had taken in our youth. I took it upon myself to create my own. The toy that’s made in America, my toy that everyone’s talking about, my favorite toy today — I got my own country, with my own culture and my own people. I had no one anymore. I took it back. “This was America, and we’d love our country,’ and that was that. I went back to live in another country. I got on in my parents’s yard as their front yard. If I could, I wouldn’t feel any less at home. It’d just be a nice place to live, with people. But my mom wouldn’t let me move in with them and do that, and she’d never let me leave. As a four-year-old boy, I knew what that felt a lot like. I lived for that moment in a world I could barely imagine growing up, like a nightmare that just wouldn’t stop — a place where if you weren’t doing something you weren’t supposed to be doing, the police would come and kick you out. It was the moment I had never experienced in the real world, which is that everything in the United States feels like it’s on fire when someone shoots a guy at a sports team, and in that moment I didn’t understand, what did that even mean, why are there sports teams shooting at each other? My dad and his friends were on fire as well. We were having a crazy barbecue one night, and the whole thing was a big party. Everyone’s families were there. Everyone’s grandkids and grandpas were there. And then, as we were having our first ever barbecue-on-a-fire-thimble, something terrible happened. The food came out on fire, and all the barbecue came to a halt. The problem was, I’d been cooking the whole time. My mom got on the phone with my brother. I’d been working so much my whole life to be good in the kitchen. And, of course, I’d cooked amazing barbecue for the whole barbecue party! He looked surprised, and we all looked shocked and confused. He asked me if it was all right, and I told him all the things I was doing: “It wasn’t. So, we came up with a cool idea: “Here’s some barbecue, and you’re going to have to play with it, and we’are in charge! Let them eat with us, and then we’are going to be great.” So that’s how I would cook at home, and as long as they didn’t know I was from another culture, or that their barbecue wasn’wasn’s, they would eat without complaint! But theycouldn’t come outside any other way, and I was in their kitchen!’The whole year, every time I went to a barbecue, I wanted to be in a different room than the one that had been my home for my entire life. When it was my turn to be the barbecue chef, my mom would cook us my favorite barbecue at home, which is the Southern South. This family of three—my mom, my grandmother, and my great-grandfather—had a great barbecue joint where everything was on. When we’went to that house for dinner every night, I’was in the backyard at home, and it was still like an old family home, except that they were all sitting around and talking. At least at that point in my life, I wasn’t living in a house at least 30 degrees below zero and had no running water. This place was so hot. We’d walk, I’d run in the yard, and there wasn’t a hint of human comfort or any kind of heat. I was living a very lonely existence. It was almost as if the house was my only comfort.” We’had another house right next door; we called this house my parents. They had a yard on the other side. There was a house on the other block, right next to ours. But our house didn’t have running water. It wasn’t a running water source. It didn’t have electricity. It wasn’t a utility grid, which for a lot of us at least, was the only connection between us and the outside world. My mother, as far as I knew, was the only woman in her family to have a real job outside of her house, as a cook—and one of the coolest jobs I ever had outside of my house was as the assistant cook at my uncle’s restaurant. It was a beautiful restaurant. It was a place that looked out over the garden on a beautiful day. A lot of things—the outside of the restaurant and the outside of the street, the road, the house—were beautiful, but the inside of the restaurant was just like every other restaurant and bar in this great city. A huge, beautiful restaurant with a beautiful view of the city, a bar on the sidewalk, and a bar on the wall. I loved it. “I remember the time when it worked, like the time that I got a job as a cook at this restaurant. The first day I came home, I’d go outside, take a look at the sky and then get my dad to open some firecrackers and light it up. This is just for the family—just us. I had this incredible sense of accomplishment. I saw it. There were no kids around. It’s this place that you can sit at and relax on a summer's day and, after about an hour, turn on the TV and watch the fireworks—that’s how much the place does for the whole family. Everyone’s coming home for another day, and I felt like the whole family was coming back with it for one. There were families with kids in their mid-teens and early-teens, a house down the block with its own children, and my mom was the cook. “Well, now I need to be in the kitchen,” I said. “What? What for?” She looked at me with that big, serious, and I never forgot that look, it made my mom really mean it. "You can have it as a gift,” she said. “But not like a birthday present. You can have it every year in the year-end gift shop.” I didn’t understand, but the store at that point in my life in those big-box stores seemed so out of touch with this country”s way of living, the way the people were—every year I got a present for all the kids in class to put on their desks. It’s a great idea if it’s in the season—it’s a great idea when it’s not. But my mom couldn’t see that. “We have to get this out of the way. It’s not a Christmas present.” This was a constant in every conversation I had in New Jersey about being gay in a culture where being gay in the closet is a given. This was someone’s opinion—her point of view. It’d be something I could listen to. When someone pointed out how much the kids at home were having a greattime, I’d take their side for one of the reasons—the fact that they never had any friends, no one to hang out. It wouldn’t be until one of the boys, who wasn’t my age at that point, came home from a party my mom had at home at my grandmother's, that I realized that this girl’s life was different than any kid my mom had known in the past—except maybe mine. This girl was my future. My sister-in-law came to see us the next day at a new coffee shop—the one where her grandfather had opened a cafe. She walked in and sat next to my mom, my younger sister-in-law, my cousins. We waited outside, and after they left, my mom and my cousin looked at the menu. It was a menu of Ethiopian coffee, a very unusual coffee. Her mother was a coffee woman; she’d order her coffee at Starbucks, too. But that one coffee was something special, and people couldn’t find it at home, and so this coffee shop came to our house at night. Then we went to sit in the kitchen and take their coffee. We drank a cup of the latte that came out in a little plastic cup with the coffee, and the other people in the family brought us drinks. My mom was such a coffee drinker. She loved it. It was my first experience with a latte. This place was like the best coffee bars in the world—a place no customer came in looking for a cup of coffee and they were out the back, making their own. That’s the way it was in Ethiopia: The street is where you have no other place to go, or you can go straight to the cafe. The coffee is great—and the coffee will make you feel like a god—except for one thing. The coffee tastes really really good in its own right, on its own as its own thing—and you’ll never be on the outside anymore, never in any cafe or on any menu. This one was a small room, so my mom came in at about six or seven in the afternoon for some coffee that looked really good and had a pretty decent selection of bottled, hot, iced-to-tea—but you could have the coffee and then have the coffee, so you had to be out and about, getting your fill, doing some shopping at a shop. You could have a hot cup and have your iced tea, but that only lasted a couple of hours, so there was a long long waiting list for iced-to-tea with milk. Then, after we had had a cup ourselves, and had tried the tea for the first time, my mom took it for the walk outside, and it felt like I had just stepped outside the door to my childhood home again with my grandparents. I got up, walked outside, and saw this lovely, very, very old, very, very old house that had been totally destroyed. It had been totally destroyed, but my dad had managed to make this thing safe for the kids to have a playpen and a playground for them to play in, and they’d be around all day playing. It seemed like this small neighborhood that’s had so much tragedy in the past, but here were these beautiful, bright, peaceful-colored people in this beautiful, beautiful country, and you’ll see that in front of you today. I never told them that. I didn’t tell them the sad stories, the horrible things I’d seen at such a young age. I was a huge wrestling fan growing on MTV until I left the network as a result of getting into trouble with my mother and getting suspended. She did. Then I got a chance to meet my future wife in law at an event when she was on TV talking about her fight against breast cancer and the role a woman as a fighter—a superhero. In the fight against breast cancer, my mom came under the pressure of the medical care system: A few weeks before my mom became ill I asked my sister if we could see her at the hospital, because I was scared of the hospital. I was the only one she spoke to about the fight against breast cancer. My sister had the best advice for me: “If he dies, you have a choice to make:” If the thing that causes him to feel terrible, he can live without you and live with this person or live with you and raise a family. The doctor said,“No, he’s had a life-changing decision to make.” I was devastated. I had to ask myself: Why not spend some time with him,I said. Then I started crying in front of his mother, a young woman whom he’d seen as a friend. She’d said, “Don’t worry,” “we”d be all right.” It happened that a month into that relationship, her mother came right out and apologized to him for this. The doctor’s reaction wasn’t that kind. The doctor was really into his daughter, who’d never asked for his support in any of this. But he’d never forgiven his wife for the way she treated him like she was an outsider who didn’t know how to interact with us. The last thing he wanted to deal with, especially with me, was this guy,’who had a whole life of being treated like this person in our life. And he had a very clear reason for why, one thing he felt really strongly about, and that was that this was a guy who could have been with another woman, living in their own world. But instead he chose to be with this woman, their daughter, and his mother, in that small house. We moved from the house to his garage—and here was a man who wanted me to do this. That was the moment we changed. One day when he was bored or angry, he would come home and he’d take his daughter aside. For my father’s wife, this was her moment. What was I supposed to do? You could be at home, playing with her son, sleeping through the night, when the whole family was at my father’s for a barbecue. The kids would be out, the whole house, the whole neighborhood. I’d sleep on my father’s back, and my dad would give her the biggest, happiest hug, and she’d be up on one of the barbecue platters, and it would be perfect. This was not the first barbecue I ate on my father. I had always known that for us there was one special moment every year, something that would remind you of his family and his life and his life, and that wasn’t ever about him. It was this one moment where his daughter came out in full, full color, full of light, full of excitement, full of joy. I remember this one moment because I was so young that my parents had a lot in common. The most common themes among our families were that in the back of our minds they knew each other and shared a love for family and had a special bond of loyalty to one another. At the time, in our childhood there was so much we didn’t talk about in that immediate, tangible way that we both learned that we also had a different way of talking to each other and seeing one another from an outside perspective. When my Dad was a child psychologist in his mid-20s, we lived in an office with a huge wall and a big flat table. That was where my mom would take her kids for playdates. This time my Mom was going to take her son, a boy in another family. He’d be with us for one week after he’d be at my father’s; then I’d take my brother out on an overnight stay in the village for just a little over a day. This time my brother will be staying with his family for the weekend; I’d be going on a long bike ride that morning. “It’s a long day? I can’t get to work? It’s almost four in the morning? What are you playing?” ‹This game is called Pokémon. It’s kind of like Pokemon, but for Pokémon. You catch these Pokémon to be special creatures.” ‹It can be as simple as getting rid of a hat to match your favorite Pokémon shirt or a hat for a Pokémon battle.” ‹But I don’t want to be a Pokémon Trainer. I want to be this person‹s best friend, their best Pokémon trainer.” ‹Oh, yeah, because I know the Pokémon.” ‹I really don’t think that’s how Pokémon works, you must be a psychic!” It was a long day of Pokémon battles, a lot of Pokémon fighting, the two of us in one room. I would never have done anything with Pokémon if not for this house in Tohukan, my uncle's house. For the first time I was living an experience. The house was always my first refuge and I loved it that way, but in this house I didn’t reallyhave time to spend at home or even just get my hands dirty. I had one great thing that my younger cousin had, a piano, and I learned to play it for my mom — I could play all day, even the day before my senior prom. At that school, you didn’t play until you came back from your parents for an after-school class. Everyone else was off working and I played with this group. When my mom came home from school — a lot of times I was the only girl in that room during an after-school period — she would play piano at some table in our living room. I don’t remember the exact moment that it changed. In that day she was playing the piano a whole lot. But for some reason her playing didn’t really get under our skin. At that point we were like an extension of her. I’d hang out with her all day every day and play, and she would come home from school and play some music that was her favorite. Maybe the most beautiful thing she did in those early years for us was take her own mother to our school's graduation. Everyone in our family was in the audience. We were all going to this really nice school to be students, but for this graduation ceremony the principal of the school was the only one. It was her grandchild who played the violin. It was all the other students and their parents, my mom’s closest friends, plus a few other relatives. She came backstage, and everyone took their seats. It was a beautiful day in the life of a girl from a big family. I loved every second of it, from the whole thing to the moment she took her seat to the very last second, every second, for everyone to give her that happy moment right when everyone’s eyes turned to her. “Please, please, please tell my mom I love her. My mother loves me so much! We’ll be a family in so many strange ways, but please tell my mom please, please I love her.” It was my first time seeing the tears of a mother, of a mother that loved her child even though her life was a nightmare, and of a mother who saw her child in all of these horrible, horrible circumstances. My mom was always the one who knew how to handle everything: no matter what tragedy, no matter how hopeless this life was, her family was always there to help. I wasn’t that good with people as a kid. When my mother took over, that was when I started to grow up with her. She was my personal person, my closest friend, my person, so in that respect I was her. My mother became like the sister that I have never had, the best person in life. Her life was my life, mine, my life. Every night, just as I was falling asleep, she came into my room with some homemade muffins. That was the first hint that something might be wrong. There was this whole thing with the white house the other year that my stepfather had bought that was so white and white and white that it had such a white feeling that every morning it was like Christmas, and for him this Christmas he made a special cake for me that was so pretty I couldn’t make it myself as much as I could at home. I got a white Santa hat. This white Santa Claus hat. I couldn’t do a thing without it. I got all my favorite things from this white Santa, too: snow and ice and red and yellow and green and blue. That Christmas, there was nothing I hadn’t tried and been blessed with already, with the only thing I’d had before is a Santa Claus hat. It was my mom bringing my brother a present from her house. My sister came upstairs, and she opened her own gift. Inside was a blanket from our grandmother, a blanket with a heart on it. It was the first time in a long time I’d seen my mom wearing that, and as a kid growing up with so many black people on his side, that was a huge moment. For the first time we started getting along. It was a short, easy childhood. After my grandmother died, my grandmother moved out of the house to a place she owned. It was an easy move: she gave them a house, took care of the kids with the kids, and took care. She never once took us on any new trips or gave us permission or allowed us to do any of that, not even when she was pregnant as a young, crazy girl named Tanya and couldn’t do the things we loved as kids. She was a stay-at-home mom who went to work when wewere in a state of chaos. There were those times I would get home from work, and the first thing you would do is turn on Tanya. She was a very intelligent woman, and she didn’t want us to be like our mothers. Tanya wouldn’t read. I’d be up all day doing that, then Tanya’d come home, read this, and come over and give me a hug. Then she’d go back to work and get ready. Sometimes it’s not an easy call. If my mother was in a crisis, there was a good chance that at least my father would listen. This is not what a father should do. But Ill say to my father’s friend’: “Please. Let him know what happens here. Because he knows better—this is not America.” When Tanya’d bequeathed us the family she did not have any of that, and in our life now as my mom had left for the University of Arkansas, we’d have our own. But Tanya didn’t care. She’d always come back with us. So every time she would ask us to come to a home where they had their own cooking and so we could sit and we’d have our own food, she would make us get up our own tools, and take us there. Sometimes they would be nice, but sometimes there wasn’t much. I remember our mom would take her little black-and-white kitchen and put a few pots to a pot of water, and she would let the water run and turn a kettle on and let the people in. At least that way people couldn’t go crazy, but when it boiled it was like you were on a small island in a lake, and the water was hot, it was like you were on a hot day. That’s what my mom taught us. You know, what I really didn’t understand about her at all is that her kids were like her kids growing up. They were always with her and she saw her kids as a big family, not like they had their own independent lives. In their time together, it’s not like she didn’t have them and raised them as her own. They had a lot of her friends with her in their church and their church, just like her kids had—that one church. So in the mornings, Tanya would get her kids. I would get my mom, who had become my whole world, my sister, my mom's best friend, to come down, and that’s where she would tell me stories from when they were younger. There was an incredible scene that was a few years ago. You see the boys at school. They are so small and they look so small. They have their parents to teach them. They have the freedom to be their own, to be their own person for themselves. But one day, the older boys in our class had a problem with the way the whole class treated them. So Tanya decided that she would make one of my older cousins into a figure skater. It started out well: My grandmother had a figure skater on, and I loved my cousin, so I was like, Wow—I feel like there should be a person who looks like me on TV. My cousin came to play. My grandma came over and I saw her. Her eyes were bright, but when we saw them I knew right away that the other kids in the class would not accept a child just because she was a girl. They’d look at her different. We would all sit at our desks during my childhood at recess—it was not until I was an adult that I realized just how much my family had changed. In our first year of public school, my mother was the principal. She gave us everything. At one point we were all together in the school's gym, which was a lot. I could look into their faces, seeing them all together. I was with my cousin all day, but I didn’t spend my whole day in class, my cousin and my older sister were in the school gym, my sister had no idea what anybody’s problem was until it was time for recess, and the teacher called us all together to say that the gym had been closed for an official school meeting. At my mom’s suggestion, we’d come up and hang out by ourselves. I was the quiet one, taking it upon myself to be the fun-loving, social person in the class. My cousin was the outgoing one, coming out to hang out with anyone. As a kid growing up in SouthAfrica, that meant I wasn’t like other black kids: I never got along with them at all; if anything I was the opposite—the coolest white kid at school. As such, I was a bit shy back then. If there was someone in your life whom you thought of as cool, you were your friend; if they were really good, you were their friend. If they were cool like your aunt, your uncle, or even your cousin, you were their friend. We were all around him; we all knew each other. We all wanted to be cool. I was the happiest kid in school with a bunch of friends who were cool, and I was always the coolest guy. That was my life. In my home at home in Waziristan, the people were like, No, no—we need to move out here! I went with my mom and my brother into my uncle, who was my uncle-in-law in law in South Africa, my mother, my aunt, the whole white working class, our neighbors, the country—the whole region. It was our new home; I became the family's primary caretaker. At home, my mom gave us a lot of lessons in how a house works and how everything was supposed to be. It was our first real year in the bush, and I didn’t know how to turn my parents on. If I had to explain myself and explain to my mother why I had done something terrible, what I’d done, how this had happened—that I would have to tell them everything, they would not believe me—what would have changed? But all I could think was, My mom was the person who, for the most part, I had faith in, my mom being with me through this whole thing was like my dad taking my father and raising him, who is a man of faith. So she was with me all the way through. It was the end of an era. This wasn’t the beginning of a beautiful new beginning. Now my father and I had to deal with a life of crime. I got a full scholarship to a few colleges. Then another scholarship, and another. Then another. Then I got my first opportunity, but it was back then, my first year—a year at a middle school all the way in a small town outside of Johannesburg, and a school I didn’t want to go to, in a town of about 20,000 people. And my dad had a lot of family back there that were just as important in the world of sports as they were in society. I could have gone back and been a cheerleader or something at a sports match, but I had no interest in that. I wanted to be a part of something bigger, so I chose to study to become a doctor. I chose to be a doctor. After my first year at the hospital, in 1994, the hospital called to say it needed an intern. At the time, my mom told me, “If there ever was a time in our life that she was ready to give her life, it would have been then. And we needed an intern for something important. If anything, we wanted an uncle who would not be that guy.” That sounded like a terrible thing to say, and I wasn’t interested in having an uncle. And that, for the most part, was the end of that. My father had become a doctor, and I was his niece as the youngest brother. To me that was his entire world—and to him I was just another person. I didn’t ask any of them for their permission, which was the difference. In my time in the hospital, I got one thing every dad should have: my dad had a great talent for making me feel special at school. It just so happened that it was in sports, in the halls, in the track track team—my favorite sport. So, as the school year was winding down, he’d come by and hang out and do a little dance class, and I took his invitation. As a kid from a poor family, I was so used. We had no money, no clothes—just him and his dance moves. I had never been dancing before; I was still in a stroller when his instructor showed us a lesson and I was the star of the class, so he invited me to join him on stage. We went up to the dance floor. This is all very typical for an African American male in my era. The instructor introduced us to our two male dancers, two white women. One was our instructor; I got to meet a whole bunch of her teachers—and her mother—and they all thought she was perfect for me. The other instructor was our professorMy mom, who was only a few years older than us, thought it was her duty to educate us in English. I learned everything from that day; my mom would send me lessons, and I learned everything that I needed from those lessons. I remember the first time she let me dance at the disco at Soweto. I got in the mood for it that night, and I didn’t know what to do. I was really into my mom dancing, so it made for a great chance for me. At least on this one date, I got a real treat, and I got to dance with my mom. There was one part of me that didn’t know I could dance very well until then; in my world that was always my problem. A few days later she brought me to a local dance performance for my birthday at a club called the Royal Royal Acropolis of Soweto, where there were only white dancers and white people. It was a hot summer day, so we were walking from one part of the club towards the next. I couldn’t help but notice the older women. They looked like they were dressed like they were in their twenties—a few years older and in better shape. The men were as good looking as we were, and they were all pretty fit. I had been dancing here forever, so I knew the best moves—and this was the best I hadn’t seen for decades here at the Royal Acropolis—and I was determined to master all of the moves. The Queen was coming for us, the Royal Family, the biggest dance performance in the world. The dance was at a fancy party with the queen. Everyone was dancing—the royal family, the royal family, the king, the queen, my cousins. But by that stage of my life, I was very much in a phase where people thought I was some kind of freak. As a child, my Dad taught me the value and importance of discipline. This dance club was not a school, so it did not have an integrated student body—it had a bunch of kids from various immigrant families. I was one of them, which meant I had to learn how to be one of them. The DJ was my friend; I got to dress like a woman. This dance club invited us in as members. My mom came up with all the DJ tunes. It was a wonderful thing for us to do, except for one thing: She was a drag queen, so our members all had to perform their own unique drag. We were all part of the Royal Drag Queen Academy, complete with a teacher, the queens, the choreography, the costumes, and everything—nothing but black, white, yellow, purple, green, red, blue, and pink. It felt so weird as a kid to go to the dance club, but as soon as there were no white people there to dance to white music or black people there to dance to black music I was in a whole lot of trouble. I loved black people; I had been to many black churches all over Africa, and I had all the music from those to play whenever I wanted at home. At my grandmother's church, there were white hymns and white hymns. I danced in black hymns and black bands all year as a kid, but then at Christmas my mom came and invited us to play the Christmas hymns. We ran through, singing along. We were all so nervous and a little bit worried, and it only took a moment for me to catch my first glimpse of something truly beautiful. I didn’t know why. All I knew was, it was a Christmas tradition of white, white, and white—but that’s not what a white person was. A white person was not white; it was a white holiday; they didn’t celebrate any other year but Christmas, and they were not, in fact, Jewish at all. I had no idea what that meant, either. It made me realize that I’wasn’t allowed to be myself, and so I didn’t feel like I could be me. We had a little Christmas tree outside my mother-in‑law”s house, and in the living room we’were having a play together. I couldn’t help smiling as she picked up these old, yellow-and‑black toys to play with. That’s the thing that I couldn’t get on with: She would play and I could not be with her. As a child, when you were a girl your parents would have a lot of fun. I never had that as a girl, and I learned over the years that my own mother was not the same person that she had been as agirl. Because I would walk back to her house from work with my mom for the first time in years, we walked out into the street together, to the backyards where she got our plants. We started growing plants. Then another plant. Then another. This time we walked home and the sun was setting on the lawn. I was ten years my junior, and yet I was still the oldest in the family. This was my first real chance to really grow up, the only time in the year I could even think on my own when it came to anything. I grew very close with my aunt and grandmother. One of her first acts as leader in the church was when we moved here in 1970 to a small area of the country, right across from what you would call the North American border. We lived on a small farm on a tiny plot of land. My mom would spend her weekends working on the land, bringing fresh water and vegetables here from a nearby river — and for one week, we were all out of the woods. It was a good time — a time when the kids and everyone at home were at the school playground, playing and having a good time. Everyone was very friendly and very happy to see us, and we had a blast. In the summer, when the trees were starting to come down and get ready to be cut and put in the garden, I and my cousin and our kids went up and picked up that first pot of spinach, the first pot of broccoli. When we were done, I started growing some tomatoes, a few squash. We loved it! For the summer, I was all but living on my mom's food supply: a garden of fresh produce and herbs and vegetables. At least it was that. But for the first time in a while I felt like I was the sole provider of my mom. I could pick what I wanted and I could plant what I had — that kind of freedom. And I knew, with all the attention my mom and her friends would get, if I just knew how to do the hard stuff and didn't let things get in the way of what she wanted, we could be in exactly the right place at the right time. We could be the new America. There was a time when I thought: This woman is a true pioneer — and the new America is a little scary for my dad. “This, man, I have never seen anything like it in my life,” “you are the greatest. You cannot be like all the other people. You must have something different to live for.” I did my best to be that guy in this world. I saw the world for what it was: a man, a scientist, an explorer. I traveled all around the planet, and I met amazing people from all over the world, not just in America. And I found that I was actually very good at that, too, being the first black man on the frontlines of that struggle, doing that extraordinary, courageous thing: being at the front lines for the first time. But it got me in the middle. In my own mind I was the man of my dreams at that point in time. He was, of course, my hero, and as a kid I believed that he would one day be one of my greatest heroes. I saw where I was coming from, the way I was growing up. I saw the ways in which my father would not give him, him, him, himself. It all happened so fast. I was five years old, and in a year my father divorced my stepmother. Then in the year after that his wife had an abortion. I'm not even allowed to talk about those events in my life at all; they were a blur. But the year following his divorce, in 1969 or so, I came out to California to take his place as head of the family business, the Disney. My dad started selling off Disney brands; they were now called his own entertainment companies, which was a huge opportunity for him and his company. We worked our asses off to build a great, amazing, brand-new resort for Disney and to build all the hotels and shopping malls that are what we call a second home. My parents, my brother-in-law, my cousins, my aunts and uncles worked their butts off doing the same, and in that time they had the luxury of spending as much as all the time apart as they wanted. But my stepfather was a total workaholic. He never wanted anyone to leave. He would be up all night, then he would be back up all day, and then come home from work. They would go to bed around four or five in the morning and then wake up, so they had a great deal of time on their hands for what they did not do. My dadwould wake me up in his old-man-mode: There was no music, no TV, no computer, nothing. My brother, who took up writing, would have me write everything down on the whiteboard. So my mom and I could go from, What did you do to get your son the best grades in the school? I got my son. The best scores in the school! That was the only thing that I knew to look out for, but to do it with my own two hands, that was something that you needed to learn—something that you could teach your son. What was that? I was not that good when it counted the most. My dad was the great teacher of mine. He was also my father. We had such a close bond as a close family. My dad, for instance, he went through all of me. This was not an easy thing for us to do: he wanted us in a house together. So, we were living at his house for a time while moving into his. There was not a single house in this neighborhood where, for a few years, neither brother would be living outside the house, but they were living as best men--the children. We were all hanging out by ourselves. My dad taught me to be that kind of guy and, just as my mom was, if you do a thing right you are that kind of guy. I was raised to be that kind of guy. He made me feel like there was an easy way for me to succeed--like, even if I didn't work, there was only one answer. I knew how many opportunities were out there for me to take them and I didn’t let them go. When I told my mom I was leaving for America to join ______________, she went off on my dad to look for an American company to take over __________, where she could have her backup plan on everything--everything from the weather. We’ve always had a good relationship. There wasn’t an issue that she didn’t do the right thing. At that point in our young lives, at least from the kids in my class to my brother and neighbors, it felt like the country would have been better off without her at its center. The last few years in school, I was the subject of a lot misbehavior complaints that seemed to be coming from both directions. In high school, my friends and some of the teachers from that school would call me on the playground and tell us, “you need to come and play in a game, and that game” was called ”Tough Love.” The problem was that this wasn’t an American game or any game for American boys. It was an international game on video games. In the United States a boy can make a woman cry because she’s a woman. The only difference today is that a woman has sex with a man. She can get a man off of her and she is still a man. So no, if I was playing today, I had absolutely no chance of winning, but for the first time in my life I was on the front and getting the whole world to play. When it was my turn, I looked up and I saw a kid who just couldn’t stop crying. He had no emotion about him, like every mother had in their own way—the same sadness of being with someone who had been through a terrible accident or they had lost a child and they didn’t know what to do or how to fix it. It was as though they couldn’t take it no more. I couldn’t get him to take it. A few seconds later he was gone, his sister coming over to play, and I got up and started playing: I’d played an hour and it’d been two hours already. Then the girls came over to play, and a group of our friends from Brickstone came running through: we needed something to play. A few girls from that school who didn’t know anything, this group of girls who had been around before, that school was a blast. It was a bunch of smart, fun, outgoing people. You would walk in and you would see people who just couldn’t keep a secret. Everybody knew everybody, from the teachers, from the janitors, the cheerleaders. Every thing was known and everyone knew everyone. I couldn’t be a part of it. I didn’t know any people’ except my fellow students, the black students. They saw us through theireyes and they saw what a wonderful, wonderful country we were. At least from that point forward my life went in a very different direction. The black kids were so nice. If they were nice I wasn’t around to be with them all the time. And the white people? Well, I was only a bystander. I didn’t have the courage and the will to make any of that change myself, but my mother encouraged me to do all I could. “We need to help those people, and not for our own gain. So, if we make this country great, we need to help ourselves.” The next thing I knew my mother was telling us not to worry. It was a hard choice, but it was a simple choice, and we couldn’t be a part of it because the black kids in our school hated America. The only option was that we all work as hard as it takes for our school to have these incredible opportunities. So we worked our hearts out for three years and the fourth year my mom asked me to go to a private school that had the same school system as my high school. I was accepted into this private school. I went into the principal's office, a very small office where there were only a few people. At first I thought this school was crazy to even think of—I didn’t have a chance. I was there for two weeks and then I left. But we made a decision the day after graduation: We were going for a private education. We were going for our studies, and we would be there when we got our diplomas. The first few weeks we were at MIT and working at Burger King and my dad’s law-school, it wasn’t the same at all. I was living in an academic dorm and studying math. I had access to the computer and the Internet all of the time. My mom used to have a bunch of friends playing video games all day at Starbucks, which is another thing she learned quickly when she was a lawyer. If these people could play video games in their day—and there were so few of them back then—then you had all of this gaming going on in their spare time. After two years, when this was our last day at Burger King, it was already pretty late in the weekend and it was time to go on vacation. I stayed, and the next morning I was going to the beach. The sun had gone down and the sand was starting to get wet. I walked around in it all day, but at that point, I knew I couldn’t stay in it all day. I knew it wasn’t going to have any real flavor and I wasn’t going to be able to enjoy the amazing weather, the incredible beach, the amazing people. I was going to spend my days on my computer, watching YouTube clips, playing games. I was going to hang out all day in a room, playing games—anything. I got a lot of those. But for some reason that day my computer wasn’t working anymore, so my entire night was spent at home. I got up and played for an hour or so, my mom got up and cleaned the house, and then we’d go play some games. My brother was in his first year of college, so he’d be with his family and play video games all day. I remember, when my mother worked all the time at her company, she’d get me back. It wasn’t like it was some kind of chore, I couldn't get in her office. But there was no way she could let a woman with me work at all, or that she’d let me take on a full-timing schedule. This was a man who knew how to take the weekends. He knew how much time he could devote to a game, the way I did. One afternoon, the internet was on fire. When I tried to post an ad in one of my favorite gaming magazines, Kotaku, my friend saw something: an image of me at a strip club dressed as Black Widow, as her, as my old friend, as a Black Widow. Black Widow and Black Widow was an extremely popular comic book series from Marvel. When Black Widow was a human, my brother had a giant red ball on his shirt. My sister and a friend bought the rights from Marvel and published it into all sorts of other forms, including video games and even a series of graphic novels. It didn’t even have a comic or a plotline for it: It was a comic book set in a comic-book world, with a Black Widow as an active superhero —a black superhero in a world thatwasn’t run by us! A cartoon. It was about a girl who grew up with a superhero like no other girl her age, and it was so funny and so relatable, I thought I should just read the comic. It was the first time I did so, and it didn’t go well: I wasn’t a superhero. I was still the average person, a kid with an ordinary childhood that couldn’t save the world, just the superheroics that could help me become an ordinary man. To this day I can never look myself in the mirror right before I die with my head down because I won?t remember who I am. My mom still has me by my side, but all the time that passes, I never feel connected to her. Sometimes I wonder, if I never had her around the house, she wouldn’t have any problem with me. But in the moment, I just can?t see her with her kids, her dogs, even my dad. We are so separate —that?s what separates us at the door? —so much that when it?s time for us to celebrate, it might not be a big thing. It might be a picnic, or it might have to be something more simple—a potluck, or we might all sit on the floor and have a drink. Or maybe, just maybe, in the future I could be the guy in charge, the person who takes care of the kids, taking away their toys and giving them back to them. But for now, that’s not what I see myself being. My Dad works so hard, and so long, and for so little, that I don?t understand why he doesn’t get to? For him it feels like he takes it on himself to care for these little kids, to make sure they get the best education he can give them. He doesn’t come home and say,“Here’s your kid,”and you leave and go to pick him up? Well, I have all of those feelings; I just can’t understand what is going on. I mean, that is exactly what I am: A man of my own making, an individual — no woman in the family! In fact, this is the first time as a boy that I’ve ever felt like this whole thing with my dad was completely wrong. It couldn’t be his fault: He didn’t love his son any longer than I ever did. And at least I knew that my dad had never abused him in any way at all. He didn’t tell us about his wife cheating, that she cheated. The only thing I never understood about him at school, besides his dad’s good looks and his intelligence and everything, was why weren’t we better off with a man like him? Why wasn’t he more in touch with this world, more in touch with this culture as a whole? I remember all the times with my dad in the playground, my mom would get up. He would pull his dad’s arm and grab his hand and say, and I wasn’t even aware of how good of an example he was,’You are my hero now,” and we would run away together. And that would be my first experience with a strong, caring, compassionate father: a great parent that would come, and go as a team, and I never felt special about it. But I didn’t know anything about growing up with a dad who was a jerk. No one treated them with respect. But it was the start of so many of the things that would make us stronger in the future: The relationship I had with my dad was something I learned early on: If you stay in an abusive relationship, you are forever stuck with your abusive friend. You end up as his problem child, and in the process you learn how to find yourself and how to deal with yourself. There were times, when everything that was happening in my life in front of me was my dad, a man who knew better, and it was the worst thing for me to ever do. It would be almost impossible to write all about it, because I am an old woman who can still feel the pain of a past hurt, but there were moments, moments of real, raw pain, there was never a chance to turn to someone to help me. I don?t think anyone remembers those days because the only people around us who did were the family and our friends at schools or wherever, not the government or someone else. There is no one there to help you. In those days, your first reaction would've been to cry or stay in bed, the worstfeelings of guilt and shame in the world. In that moment I would've known—I knew better—that in this crazy world, my parents and my grandparents' generation had made one of those choices to get me into trouble. There was no choice for me. It didn't stop them. My dad and all my dad's friends had already made a choice. I had a choice. If I could just accept that, then I would always have a father who would be able to change my life; I would never have to do that alone. I could go for a walk and get in his car, or I could run away, stay in the house, and find a man from whom I would have an incredible relationship. I had no choice—that was my destiny. I was no more a man for my own good than my wife had been a man for her own good. I just wanted a dad who was with me always. My dad knew this, too. He knew that there was no magic in life, but the man was always around to give me the advice. He gave me back my father—and my dad. I am so grateful, in my mind—to my father, who loved—and accepted—my father's love for me. I never saw him in a worse time when I was a kid. My dad didn’t see the time and money for me in my life anymore. He was the one who helped give my daughter back the mother she had lost. In that time, he was the one who taught her all that life was about. For years, I didn’t see it that way. I was always my dad’s protector. If I would have stayed in that relationship with my dad, my mom wouldn’t have had anyone but my dad. My father didn’t give my mother any choice. The only place she had a choice was herself. And at times she would be like, “I just wanted a man, and there was only me... and I don’t know what a man is. I just wanted something to be.” That would be the end of the family. It would be sad for the whole family to see them all go through the same thing: divorce. She would leave my dad with no money or anything—just a divorce. “Your dad is a broken man.” “He’s a broken man. He can spend his life worrying about something or living life on his own terms. Is there something wrong with him? Or is there something wrong with me?” She didn’t have anyone there to be her father. I didn’t feel like that. “Your parents have been together for so long—they don’t need a man to stay in touch.” “I don’t want to be my dad in the way that my parents are, in the way that this man is.” “Well, you need to figure out who you want to be.” I wasn’t happy with the answer. I knew that the father was a man of great qualities, but as my dad grew older it became clear that if I was ever going to be able to be the man that my uncle had always hoped I was going to be I needed to change. I was in the ninth grade when my mom got me a high-tech computer. My dad took the chance and put it on my shoulders—and it became one of those things where he was the leader, not me. It didn’t help that it was a Commodore 64—a very old, very expensive computer—and my dad was in his 70s. When it worked I was completely amazed by what it did for me. It made me feel like I was an artist—a complete creative genius. I felt like I wasn’t going to let my curiosity get in the way of that. I had an incredible creative imagination, and it was my dream that as a kid I could be as talented as any artist in the world. Not only was I doing that, because I loved to create, but I was also doing things like painting on canvas the same colors back in my day—I could draw a picture on chalk on one day and a picture on chalk on the next, and the next day be in a studio drawing that same picture. So I was an artist, too. At the same time, though, the thing about my dad, my mom, my cousin—you know him as a guy who could be so cocky about it at times, sometimes he’d act like it was his job to be the boss that they’d call on. Sometimes I’d say things right out loud, like, Dontake my shirt off. Don’t. Not my. My. T-shirt. My job is not for you. This guy would take us in for coffee in the parking lot, and he’d be like you had the best coffee I’had ever had, and then it was over. When we arrived at Starbucks we were already in our car and ready to go for a drink. I was the first one in. I sat behind the bar. It was the first thing we did in a long time in this area of Atlanta, and my mom always made sure I knew what to do, and what not to do. We went downstairs to the living room with the two of them. It was a gorgeous summer day in the middle of a hot summer in South Africa. My brother and I sat back in my mom’s arms. We were both nervous and excited. My sister was the youngest on the block, my older brother was the smartest. My sister, in all of this, was a lot of what America was all about: The American Dream. That is, America was supposed to be your best option. At least, that was how my mom described it. I could have gone back in time and changed my life to get my younger brother any number of things he didn’t have. Instead, I chose to stay the course, stay true to my sister for as long as I could; stay a little more involved with my mom; be with her. The other thing that I learned in my younger years during this entire childhood in South Africa—and this is what makes it so special to know your entire family and know that you live in one family and that you are from one family. This family—this one—will support you. It’s not that I didn’t give them any support at home. I had a wonderful relationship with them. They were always in my life when it came home to the family. The older brothers always had to be my best friends and my best cheerleaders at school events. The younger brothers—they’d pick me up from school all day. I never had a problem with that. They loved me dearly, but I had my own problems at home; my mom would always say, She didn’t want to be like this. It wasn’t for me to change. She didn’t need me to be like my mother. My mom, by this point in my life, was starting to think that there was something wrong with her. It didn’t work for her to just be with her, be with her. She had other things on her plate in life that meant something to so many people. In fact, they were the things that made my mother very close to my dad. When we were younger and growing up in South Africa, my stepfather had a big dream: He wanted us to go to Europe to live in a kiddie center. When he told us that he did, my mom and my sister-in-law and my brother and me went to Europe for three years for his birthday, their first visit as a family. It was only for three weeks, for a holiday, and then we were back at work, getting ready to go back home for a weekend of family. That was my first real taste of what it was like to grow up with the parents in his house. The kids would come over to his house, and my dad would bring us some of their favorite food, and we’d have a few bites of that. It was never something we’d do when we’d be at school, so we were always just getting our share. One afternoon my mom got a call. It was just after dinner, our kids were at school, so my mom got the kids to get dressed in their school clothes, then came down the hallway to find her older brother standing in the kitchen. He looked so young, but when he heard her say his first name out loud, his face lit up. It was like my life had never happened. It was his favorite thing in life, too, right in front of the kids, and he had the most perfect picture with it. "My father was a great dad. I grew up with great fathers," he told her over the phone. "They taught me to do that, too, but our parents taught us never to be like him. It was like he was watching an old movie where he was so cool, and here, all of a sudden there was a cool, super-cool dude. We never had a chance to have that. Our dads, the greats, they were like, It doesn’t matter. No, never sayever, never tell me about that boy. That boy didn’t exist. If you know something about a guy, you are always going to know it later. That boy didn’t exist. That”s what life always did: It was never going to end for a white person, because it never ended for a white person, because racism is a lie, and there are too many people in this country who live by it. So that’s where you’ve got to stay. You should stay. You should live a life of doing something different. I’d lived that for the longest time and never changed. I was never going to be white. I never wanted to live for anyone else but this one person—that’s the only person in a different world. I’d become accustomed to living in a world of only one. I’d become accustomed not to speak with a different accent for a new friend's birthday party. I never wanted to be on TV. I never wanted to hang out in the street with people of a different culture and not feel like I did. I did. I never felt like I needed to. Every time it was my birthday, it was my mom inviting me into her house, and I just went right in, grabbed some candy. I didn’t know what I wanted before we opened for them. I wanted to take the whole cake. It was my mom, for God's sake. But the cake? I wasn’t allowed to take it. I didn’t have it. I needed a friend to hold the whole thing for me. The guy held the whole thing right up to our faces. They’d made me a cake to celebrate my birthday, because it was their day off from work. So, my sister invited my cousin, the only child of a Chinese-American woman and a black man, to hold a birthday bash at his house. At this house, everything was Chinese. So, my cousin and I got a bunch of china from an old lady to decorate the house, and then we got all the china we could in the grocery store. And of course, my cousin came home from work to bring us these huge blocks of white china. And we got all of the white china in between the houses: a garage, a backyard… It was all white, but we lived in a house with black people, which was like the middle-class white suburbia in South Africa, a little more white, a little less black. So, my whole life has been filled with white people. But my house in China was like…well, the whole of my life was filled with white people. That was my home. It was my family. My mom. My sister-in-law. My uncle. My aunt; her two oldest daughters, all five of their grandsons; my cousin; my niece. My niece; my niece’s son. My niece; my niece's daughter, her nephew; my grandfather, his only child; everyone from the time I was born until I was six years old. My whole life, I had a home, but from an outsider's point of view it was like this…I lived in a hut at the end of a river, in a swamp; all the men worked in one place, and the women, who lived in another. And I would wake up in the middle of the night and I’d hear the water running through the bamboo, and in a month I’was back in the hut, running with the men and all the men, and this would be the most perfect time ever because now I really loved that jungle. Every night—the time that we’d wake early, we’d hang out, we’d hang out, we’d have these giant sandwiches, and it was like all of a sudden, this place changed, like our lives were on a different wavelength. We’d have this whole evening, and then come another thing, and then this thing with the sandwiches. We were always doing our own thing, from time to time we’d try something new, from a new place. But I still wanted to hang out with the black people there. This was where the real black people were. They were so friendly. There was not any drinking, the only alcohol we drank was Coca-Cola for dessert. We had a lot of fun hanging out. I would get on the phone and talk to some black guy about what was going wrong with their country today. He would say, “Well, it’s just they are not the people they used to be. Itnot the same as what we used to be. They don’t have our freedoms and our traditions.” He said that. This is a man of courage in that moment. He did not believe that if someone was afraid of him, that person would change. “Oh, man.” I was on this phone with this black guy, this young black man, a man who couldn’t even find a job—a black man. My mom came out on the television to say, “You need to be safe.” “I don’t want people to be afraid,” “not because of me. But because of the world today.” “The world.” My father was like, I don’t know why? My mom was like, “Look, this is our problem, not our problem.” I can tell my father’s point of view as an adult is: You can be as good a leader as your father ever was, but it won’t do you any good if you stop doing that right away. You need to find your roots, stay involved, grow up with the family. The best thing about the life in my dad’s household was that he never turned us from the United States as we knew it into a country. He knew America already. We could have been in the same situation as France with the First World War in the middle of our history. And the problem is that we weren’t in Europe. France did not have a strong nationalist movement at that. It was a country of people who could take a stand for what they believed in, because France was the country. In Africa we had a strong Christian nationalist movement. In South Africa the Christian right ran the country. In South Africa it was the government running the country. That was how the country felt. The Christian right was the only political party with any real power in the past. We didn’t see any change with a change in government, with the rise of the African National Congress. We had a strong black Republican Party. We had a strong white Republican Party. The only difference between those parties was what our leaders were doing before and after the elections. In South Africa, my father was the leader of that party, and if there was ever going to be an election there was going to be an election now. He didn’t have a party and wanted that one party to take over and run the country without ever calling the elections. When you hear that, I know what you mean: It wasn’t fair. It was time for them to step aside. What was that like leading a party? I had no political experience by the time my father entered politics. It was a very new thing in South Africa: an alternative political party was coming out to the political arena to run against the country. There was no party that would do that—not the ANC, the National Party, nor the Democratic Alliance. They were all for the same things, which was why South African politics, and the politics of the country at large, had changed. The ANC, for example, was the biggest political party in the country at that point for the very first time, and it was running as a national campaign on the election day. There were only 40,000 people in the streets, and for the first time in South Africa. There was no party in power for the first time in an interregnum. In those days there were parties, but they could not campaign, could not get on platforms, and could only campaign among the people, not among the elite. This was a different party that would do things their way. We used to campaign every year, and I was the guy who would campaign for the Freedom Party, which was an anti-Islamist, anti-Zionist, anti-Israel party. You would go up and meet them for coffee, and the coffee would be at Starbucks and you could buy them cups of coffee and just sit and watch them talk about how horrible Muslims were, how unfair Muslims were, how this world was against them. It was all great. The only problem was when our coffee would go bad it would come out the side. I’d get a cold. In those days it was just me and a few people. And sometimes my coffee would be bad. People would drink a large quantity of their coffee in the morning and find a bowl of crudite outside the house, and then come back the next morning and I’d be full. It was not uncommon for people to get very hot, and then they would leave the house and drink a bowl of cold coffee the rest of the morning. I’d neverbeen so full of myself at any point in my life. I didn’t want to stop. This wasn’t the day my life was really that good—that I’d ever get a girlfriend. A few years later, I started dating a guy from work. The way life is. That whole world changed in a matter of hours. The whole thing just sorta happened, and I got to be with a guy I was really attracted to. There were some days we’d get off at work and go shopping; other days we’d hang out and have the most amazing time in the store. I loved it. In all honesty, I didn’t get much of a break at that point. I never wanted to go back and do everything the way it was. I could tell that he’d found love with someone very different than the person he had with his mom. We’d hang out in the mall for an hour; that was our downtime. It wasn’t like it had become a one-hour special at the movies, or anything like that. But I never missed work for lunch, for dinner, or any time to enjoy myself. I was the happiest child of a working-class family in the middle of an industrial economy that was still looking for ways to grow. My whole childhood was a very short stint—a full season, if you’d count that Christmas period in my first year—with nothing but time with my family. I would get at least an hour-and-a-half working on a Saturday, at least, for a few hours during lunch, for one last hurrah of the day. But at the end of my shift, it was already time for dinner. If that was not enough time to spend with my aunt and my sister-in-law—my dad’s sister— I’d spend an hour or so with my father, then come home to my grandmother's house (and all the other people in their time and their space), and we’d get our dinner. At least that was what we kept saying, even when we didn’t eat dinner together. The first time we ate dinner together, we were sitting at a table and his sister came up to introduce them; after that, my dad’s entire life went back to that time in the summer of 1992, during the Korean War, he knew that this woman—this person—could be like his mother. It didn’t matter if they had young children in the house, or if it was just a few years later—that woman would know how to raise them. They knew how to raise their kids. They could be on their own. That’s the thing about my dad: I’d see what he did the first time I saw him on television. I was five years old at the time—the second half of the first season of The Good Wife. My dad had gotten a raise from the government. He’d been in a car accident and had to give up a job at Walgreens to look after his two little sisters. This woman from The Good Wife was a real woman with a family, and she came to him—and we were a family—and he’d give her some money to help with that. He gave them some. She got a car. It was in my dad’s garage, and it turned into a driveway where all these cars were waiting to be picked up and moved from one place to another. I had no idea what to do. My aunt and cousins were in on the fun. It was the middle of the summer, my family was all together at one family pool in Maryland. There was a house with its own pool in the backyard. The house next door had a swimming pool and the pool on one side, and my grandmother’s backyard, a beautiful piece of land now, next door to the house, was beautiful, so close to a road I was the only kid in my neighborhood. So I was the only kid in my neighborhood. That house next to ours was our backyard, my backyard, my backyard—a small piece of the country, a piece of the landscape. There were no fences or anything to keep it in except a small hedge. As a black child, my mom came with me from a very small town to a very big city, where people called it, ”Harem.” That’s what you’ll call any city in the Middle East; the black majority of the people who live near the sea. As a black child, I had only one cousin, a brother. It’s not like we were close in age, eitherbut my mother was the most distant friend in the family; she only saw them for a few days. That was her way of telling me, “You don’t know where your brother is, unless he knows where your mother is.” I didn’t. There were times I’d run into my dad every few weeks — I got in there with a black man, and they were the only people around, not the white people. It was a lot of fun, but in the time it took us to get married, my mom had decided that if she was to be the woman in our lives she had to be a woman. And I knew what that meant. I knew what it meant that it was our first real step into a world where we could be, with our whole lives, women in our own right. At one point, my dad’s wife, who also came from a family that had never let its women off the hook, took me aside and said, “We have to do something. We have to go to the police and get our family members to join us.” I had never been a part of a woman’s movement; until that point in my youth, I had been in a man’s movement. I wasn’t in any man’s movement. I was a man in his time. This was mine. This must be it, right here in the middle of the road, right up against all the trouble of the world. But I wasn’t the one who could change any of that. I didn’t feel comfortable in this man’s world. I wasn’t comfortable being in any woman’s movement or any man’s movement. For an infant, I didn’t speak from a woman’s heart. I felt—I did feel—like they took everything from me. They took my confidence away completely. They took my love away completely–that was all. That was all. If they took our love away, I wasn’t going anywhere. I felt like everyone else felt the same, or more so. So as a baby boy, as a member of a new generation, the first thing a dad does on his first day at work is he takes the kids to see a movie. His friends, his family come together and see a movie. They come after work. There was no time for anything but to hang out with them. I remember one Friday afternoon as a boy I was at my grandparents' house, my grandma in our kitchen, a beautiful white, white dinner and it was all ready. My mom’s mom brought us my grandmother, her cousin, my Auntie Mlungisi, my grandpa, three grandsons, my grandpa. I was six years old and I was in my mom’s hands. She’s a great mother and a great mother will do anything for her children. I was going to spend an afternoon with them to hang at one of their summer homes in the garden—they’ had a small patch of white sand, and since my dad wasn’t allowed to play there, my mother was going to take me out to do some gardening. As we walked around, I could see just how much my aunt had grown up with him all over again, even though, on this day, they had taken him away and left him all alone to his own devices. He wasn’t around at all, only her. Her two older sisters took care of their grandpa. This was the only black woman in her life, her only other child, a man who had been with them so long that she and her family could never leave. The two of them would hang with their dogs. My Aunt Mlungisi and her family moved with me every step of the way, and she had my whole life from our years in the city to our last trip down the road in her old family's house in the Kogi Park area on a beautiful parkway, a beautiful place, not much less so today, in the midst of the shantytowns where there are no running water, no electricity, and there was a lot of shanties, and the grass was always greener in the summer—now here in the middle of everything was the park, which was like a miniature version of what the park had been like a generation or two earlier, with only some trees. I remember one afternoon my mom went out to pick up the kids, and as she pulled out one of those green plastic bags containing some foodstuffs, something caught her eye. The ingredients were the most disgusting and revolting food I had ever tasted: raw rat'sfeet, snake skin. I immediately knew I needed to get to the emergency room, and I called my friend Taniya. Taniya, who came from a big family in a big village, had come to the small-town emergency room one afternoon. The place was packed with the elderly, mostly malnourished. The only reason this wasn­t a big deal to her was because these people were sick. They were people who could have a good day and a great day, but in fact that day never came. I didn’t know a thing about medicine then. That was one of the first things I learned. I was a new guy, and as a new guy the first thing people said when they heard my name was, “Who’s that?” It was a good question, and it was not meant as a joke”. This is the reason why I had to learn the language. I got to learn some dialects. I had an English-speaking friend, who, for the first time in my life I was not on top of everything. It was one thing when I had no idea what was going on, but this friend from my village, who wasn’t from my school, had an extremely rich man's English that was very easy to understand, very conversational. As a kid I had this one friend in my life: I’d say, “Look man. Look who really knows how to talk in a language that you don’t.” In fact the thing that made this whole thing great—and maybe it would have been great had she not been white—is my mother had more time—maybe another couple days of her time with me, maybe another month—but my mother would have taken over the parenting with us. It is impossible to imagine that anyone, anywhere, in America, would take less to be that parent. When my sister was pregnant at home with our mother, she came back and said, “I’ll take the baby because it’s the only child we’ve ever wanted for, like, twenty years.” It was the first time in our lives in which we were completely together. This woman could really take it. She was the mother. She gave the biggest, love-the-children-every-day, never give-up-with-the-family attitude that I remember from the days I was with our grandmother, the one I got my first love. So, there we were. Her and my grandmother and our uncles and our brothers, all with their amazing lives, and the baby we loved; the baby we’d spend a lot of time with; our baby girl, who wouldn’t change a damn thing for the world; that was it. And at least, if I wasn’t in her presence I wouldn’t have had the courage to tell her, “We don’t need your help, it is time to give back.” I wouldn’t have had that. I didn’t have a sense of what the world would look like if we just took a moment here and there to give back—that instant of joy, of giving back to something that you do love. One of my earliest memories of my mom is that I and my friends would sit down and play in the backyard, and there’s this old woman, my mother, my grandmother, who was the perfect grandmother for us: big and soft, friendly and generous. If a girl had a son, it was him. If a boy had a son, she was the perfect man to take care of him. We’d hang out and play games in peace. On rare, if a woman caught us in a situation where they were really angry at us and we were the only ones left standing, we would play video games together, one a day, one a week. There was no time for sex. If the mother was home or a babysitter had returned, she would get some sex from her. No, she’d bring the children. I was the only child, like, and I was so in love with my mother I didn’t like anyone outside her—not my stepfather, my grandfather. My first year of high school was a nightmare. For the first time in my life, I felt like my dad was the one in the relationship. I wasn’t going through any kind of a phase with being a man—being a man of the street, living in the city, living in the house—and I couldn’t understand the problem. I couldn’t get over the fact that my dad was in a relationship with the man hehated for a living. It was just another reason why I loved him, in a way—but as a woman I couldn’t understand why his life was so difficult when in such a loving relationship of mine it was easy; I had a partner and it was a wonderful relationship, too. It was a little like in my life where my mom would be so close friends with people and yet we wouldn’t hang out all the time, the same. I was the only girl, and I got teased so much for it. We’ went to a lot of hangouts where people would hang out in front of a fire. A girl would be there, dancing and getting a little bit messy. I’d listen and go, “This is so hot” and that. I felt like it was a big deal. Then after a while somebody would ask the question again, or a guy would ask it again—and I was at my wit’s in response. “What are you doing?! What’s this all about?!” That was just me. What was it about? Well, I was a teenager at that time. Everyone was so used to it by now—the dance floor, the hook-up culture—that we were accustomed to it all—you go in to hang out with your friends, your favorite song is "Back in the Day" when you were at such a high point in your life—that, for the most part, it was like being at a party with your mom. That's what it was all about. It could be some oldies music, some house, some hip-hop, or whatever—any style of music. But at least there would always be the guys, in the bar, dancing to their favorite artists, the DJ from their favorite band performing a great cover of some of their favorite music. You could dance to your favorite DJ. You could dance to someone. I couldn’t get used to it, and it didn’t make me any less of a rebel. That was why I couldn’t leave. It took me a long time to grow up with that. I spent my days, every waking moments of every waking hours, in school in a classroom full of people learning and teaching. But in high school I wasn’t the smartest kid in my class and the smartest kids would be the smartest kids in my school. So for the first time in my life I had an opportunity to be the smartest person in my class. I was a genius, a genius, and it was no exception. I won a prestigious science award. But if you think that comes out of the blue, that is not what happened. I was the smartest person in the class, in all of my classes, my teachers, my counselors. In the year before my senior year in high school I went to an all-girls school with one white boy who was white — and, in most cases, that was the point. We all had different interests, and I was the one with the power. But when we went to a science conference we had to study together—one of us to go to another one, and the other to go somewhere else and not back. I was the one studying, and that kid—who wasn’t studying, who didn’t seem like he was studying, did not seem like a real person—was the smartest person in the room. I took his place, and I did my best to take the professor, who was the smartest person in that room—but in that conference, there wasn’t an audience to listen to him speak. There was only me—myself as the expert—and him trying to convince everyone else what the hell he thought was going to happen, and they were going to follow our advice and make it happen by taking a test and then passing the question, or just not taking a test. That was like a test for the whole school. But what was the point of studying for that? For science? To become a physicist? To become a mathematician? I took the tests as an opportunity to learn a new skill, and, at least in the end, what a kid from an all-white neighborhood had brought to life was the only thing my mother and her cousins and their relatives and their neighbors could learn: that the color line isn’t all that great. We weren’t getting them all in one class, in one semester—we’ were going to give them a little something for free to give us an introduction to a new thing. So that semester I learned some new things: it didn’t matter if I was a redhead or black, I could learn from the black kids and getalong. The first year in our high school, we’ went back with our parents to my mom’s college to get an A in English. It was all I could do, but I knew then that there wasn’t much I could do for my mom. We lived back in Brooklyn, where the only blacks in my hometown would be the black. And, of course, in any white neighborhood, I could go to an integrated, black-owned bookstore. But in my own small little town, I had no place where I could go and buy books to read for my friends and my community. I couldn, in fact, walk out of that bookstore and walk right up to another store and buy the same book. In fact, it happened at least every other weekend that I would walk home from school: It was a rainy Saturday. I was walking through my hometown, sitting on a bench outside my high school’s library, when a group of girls came over to get me. They weren’t that young—they’d all been in my school for just a few weeks—but they were all so kind—they gave me their home. These girls were the kids we were all hanging with at school—people from our school. I had never been with a group of girls to hang out with like that—I had never been that social on a Saturday evening, either. That was a perfect opportunity to meet all that group of people in their own home, because I felt like I knew them in a whole new way and in a whole new way. In that instant—in that moment—I knew what an amazing thing I had discovered—an opportunity that I never, ever, ever would have been given any choice in life. To have people like that, it was like I could never live in a house in another person’s home, either—or at least I had something in common with them. But at least I had the privilege of hanging out at a coffee shop in one city, enjoying a great cup of coffee, drinking on my own and enjoying my own company. But that afternoon in this city, there wouldn’t be any coffee—and I’d have a cup of coffee—for my mom to help me feel okay. I got my own and my mom’s favorite coffee. The shop was right down the street and my mom would have a cup of it, too. I would be making my own coffee. I wasn’t going to sit at home all day and make it every morning. That coffee was for my friends to drink. It wouldn’t be any hotter than mine—the same good coffee, the same fresh-coffee, the same great coffee. That coffee would never be more expensive than what a Starbucks has set aside for themselves. The only problem was, I didn’t think the coffee I was making was any good. The thing about coffee is that it’s kind of a weird drink: It’s like a little cupcake, but the whole cupcake is going, like, super hot. It doesn’t taste like anything. I never felt like it. In those days I didn’t drink to get high: I drank my coffee, then my tea, then my energy drink—then my morning smoothie—and then my afternoons I″d go out for dinner. I was never into that—I wasn’t drinking to get high. I drank my tea and I had some energy, which I was craving at the bar, so I was drinking energy drinks and energy drinks straight from the cola machine. I remember at one point my friend Momma came over, a really cute-looking girl whose whole face was pink because she had anorexia. We went over and got Momma in her pajamas. Her pajamas were pajamas, too. Her pajamas were so tiny I thought I was in heaven. Momma came over and we took off my clothes, revealing my body as nothing else—I looked so beautiful that the next thing I knew I was completely naked and naked from the waist down all the way through to my underwear. After an hour or two my breasts were really big. I had a huge boner so bad it looked like it was bursting from my butt! When we went to get another girl to hang out, there was already a guy who looked really nice. By then Momma was so into our first girl that we felt a need for someone who wasn’t, so we went and got another guy who wasn’t. We decided not to hang out a lot, so we hung out in the street for an hour or so and hung out and hungout like crazy on our spare time. This guy came over and hung out in the yard. He had a bunch of CDs of Beatles music, some Stones cover songs, everything. I was so happy to know that I could hang out with people my whole life. The next morning that friend brought us a couple of turkeys and some ham for breakfast. It was a nice break from going for a jog when we were on our feet all day. I picked out my favorite turkeys in the shop; some good, some not-so-good; my mother was the best butcher on earth. All that was left for me was to try them out, and if they turned out to be any good I was gonna have something. This was my first introduction to the whole meat-and-potatoes food-style thing that this country has become. They came with nothing but ground lamb and some herbs and veggies. I’d have to eat one whole pig, but I’d have something with my morning coffee; the whole shop would be my new favorite. So I went. The first pork-and-cheese sandwich in a while was something I never thought I’d get a chance at doing. I had no experience with anything but burgers, and my mom thought I wouldn’t be successful. The only reason I had any interest in meat was because my dad told it to her, and they were always making me go on a big meat-and-potatoes-eating festival. “My son would like to be like the best carnivores. He’s never going to eat anything but vegetables.” I couldn’t disagree with them, and the festival was my first taste of that thing people love: their entire diet is plants. It’s all plants, but the only reason I would be able to do that on these massive stages at the very top of the food-entertainment industry in the United States was because my stepmother told me to go plant something and be the greatest veggie-eating superhero in the world. This was the first time in my life I went to a plant-based restaurant outside America to eat a vegetarian lunch—an entire meal of plant-based vegetarian food that you’ve never seen in America before.” In America today, I don’t think that people have any idea that there are so many good vegetarian options. I don’t think they know that they’re not alone on the planet. In the United States there are thousands of restaurants where you can order vegan burgers, sandwiches, wraps—anything that's not meat. But we never saw anyone cooking up a huge bowl of vegan brie to go with an entire bowl of veggie burgers or sandwiches. We never heard this guy in the kitchen talking to the chefs over at one of the best vegan restaurants in America. I got my hands on some veggie burgers. I took a handful at a time, a little. Then I threw them in one of those mini-matthes that go under the counter at a grocery store. I put them in an instant pot and I threw everything else in. It was super easy. I mean, who would have guessed that with their meat and dairy products they could make a vegan burger out of their vegetables? My mom had all the ingredients and she just cooked them up in the kitchen and I went in for the cooking. It was one of those moments—something just clicked. I was a kid that day, so I knew all the ingredients of almost every food at this restaurant. They all had the perfect balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. This woman would be the vegan celebrity chef to this guy's meat-and-potatoes-eating-chic. I was like: “This is it. Now it just…is. My life is made. I’m going on a plant-based diet for the rest of my life! My life will not last another minute. I can live an ethical lifestyle for the rest of my life…for an extremely long time.” It was an important day, and now that I didn’t feel like it was my fault, and now I could go back and avoid this whole thing, I took the plunge: “I don’t want to be like my mother.” I took her advice. She wanted me to learn from her mistakes, but I had my own. My whole life, my entire life at least, my entire life, I was told there was no such thing as a perfect woman unless she was perfect. She taught me to be who I am—and I didn’t learn to be who I wasn’t supposed to be, and I didn’t learnhow to be any other way. But that was my one chance in life to be an example for the world that anyone could be anything, be anybody’s best friend any—and then have the world be like, “you can be who you are right now—you can be who you can be.” I learned that as a boy that was the one thing you could do. I remember one night I found myself alone at home with a bottle of Jack Daniel's. I wasn’t drinking my Jack Daniel’s, but the bottle of Jack Daniel couldn’t burn. The bottle of the same brand (of whiskey in the bottle) was left on a hot day, and I felt the burn from the heat of the cigarette—I’d be right back there, smoking and smoking all day with this thing on, but at least from the outside the burning on the inside would make it look like I was doing something wrong. It didn’t seem like a big deal, and for a lot of people this was one of those times in their lives where they could have never bought something like that from a store again, but I was a kid with an infinite supply of money and was never going to start getting my hands dirty like the guys at Sam's Club, so that’s what I did. I started my own bar and I stayed within the liquor laws, which was the biggest, most strict thing I could do in my small town because I didn’t live on the weekends—that was for church. I couldn’t drink on Saturdays, either. But on those Sundays I could go to my aunt in-law's home on a Sunday in the middle of the week. My aunt would make us a special menu of all kinds of old-time-fusion, and we would have it for dinner. I got to take an old-fashioned Sunday-class in the backyard at her, and from the time we were done I was the king of the class for a whole hour. I didn’t even know what to do at times; I was a complete beginner at it all. Then one Sunday my cousin was a teacher at her college, and he introduced another kid to a certain discipline: He taught every Sunday morning that there was a prayer circle outside of school, in school. I started going for some of those, and the other kids came running back to pray. I could do the whole thing in a single day, and it would have been a lot—it was our first chance for something to go wrong with our education; the only problem was that I didn’t know what went wrong with it; I would have to figure out. I was a genius at everything else in my life at once. But for God’s sake—I had to find a way to escape. I couldn’t go outside. Not in the city. Not in the country. Not anywhere. The only thing I needed to do in a day was go to Walmart for a few hundred dollars worth of the stuff that my mom had on sale. They always had a pretty wide selection. The shelves were so full that even at least one day I was running out while shopping for the new toy that I was the sole adult on the shelf. But I had to finish up before my mom would have to buy anything, and then I wouldn’t have another chance at school. I was on top of everything, so by that point my mom had already come up with a great excuse for canceling the lesson. “This is why I got my daughter out of here. You need a week to get on with your studies,” she said, in what was clearly a desperate attempt to save face,””‒but she’d been told that since this kid was so talented in school that at least this time it was not an excuse for her to take her own child out into country.” There were no other options for her when there were fewer things to choose from than the endless options available at Walmarts or Toys R Us. I was, of course—I had money to spend. One day my mom would tell me to ask the teacher if she could do it. I wanted nothing to do with this. But if the teacher agreed, I could always ask her. The day after the third grade ended, my mom took my stepfather and his stepmother to a nice house for a weekend. The two of them spent a morning on the beach on their tiny little beach front lawn, sunbathing in their backyard. My dad went up and came back. We sat and talked, and I realized,“I have nothing to do. This is where my dad haseverything’down. In one day, he’could be my dad. ‪You need to get out. I need to be with my best friend.‹ When my dad didn’t return, that was the end of that. There was just me and my Mom alone. We were alone together. My dad was the only human being in my life. I didn’t know what a boy-boy life ever did to me and so for the first time in years I didn’t need him. In a matter of hours, I got my own, my own, my own. We were on our own. He was my father at my side at every turn. I learned how to take charge of my own life. At age eleven, my father would not let me have a single thought about anything but the task at hand. “What you do now is up to you, and if you need something,” he would say. “No, you need to get in a car.” In that day, I wasnt the only one to get it. I took the keys in a hand-me-down from my father and we sped off to the nearest city—now I was the car dealer”—to buy our first car: a Volkswagen. There’s a lot they could do with a Volkswagen. After all, my dad was the Volkswagen guy in the car dealership, one of the best. He would give the salesman the keys to his car like he was giving them to everyone else. In a few weeks we sold the car, and we were off. It was a nice car. The car was brand new but it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for. The salesman at our car dealership was a man of strong character and good values. In my time at my dad’s shop a few women would come in with their girlfriends, and one of my best friends would come in with her boyfriend. One afternoon there were a dozen or so us, all wearing white shirts and black pants. They took their shirts and hung them on their heads in the shop, their hair in shaggy ponytails—just for a sign that this was what a woman looked like. “What are we doing?!” My mom had come over, and we were all in a frenzy of mamma’s arms, and she and my friend, I felt like an extended family. My mom started the fire, my grandmother lit her chimney and my cousins came to light and started cooking for us. The boys and my grandfather came over to cook some. I was so excited. “What’s the deal guys” The boys started at one end of the grill and then the girls at the other end. They mixed it all in, and there was a great mix. It was delicious. I ate everything and loved it. Then, in the morning, it was time for them to get back to their little corner of the table and hang out.” There was more than one way they wanted to get back to it. On the first day that the boys and I were on campus, we’d hang out at home and have our little barbeque, and I’d get my mom one of the pork chop sandwiches that my great-grandmother had the recipe for. The morning after school, I had a chance meeting: The women from America’s Best High School. It was my first day at a new school, a private liberal school in the North African nation of Benoni. The girls, the brightest minds of their time, were there. I started getting an immediate feeling that something was going wrong. All day, the girls were laughing and talking and talking. It was the first day, but, for the first time all day long I went home with my parents and I got my mom's advice. ”What do we want our kids to do?” My mom came up to the living room one morning, looked around, and smiled. I looked up. “Mom.” That’s something that’s true. No matter where you live, there are always good people like you, in your community—people like you. ″You’ got my vote for what to do!” ″I’ll vote Yes.” ″So, Dad” said. ″Go get yourself on television.” ‹No,” said my dad, 'I don’t think that is a good idea at all,” “it would just make things more complicated.” I had no answers. My mom was very good at that.She knew how to turn on a journalist, how to make people, especially me, into the story. The reporter was my mom. My dad was the only person who knew what to say and, more importantly, what not to say. A week after he’d left us, I went shopping. I picked out a black dress that fit right over the top. But I couldn’t wear it; my mom had told me it was too revealing. So I wore it. No matter what the store said I was allowed to wear, I was not to be in the store for more than an hour. It was an hour and a half in the morning. Then it was an hour and a half in the afternoon—and an hour and a half the next day. There was no telling how long I was on the clock, and how much time it took to get my dress to my sister—my niece's middle school. I’d spent many a summer afternoon sitting in my mom”s living room, staring in tears. My mom”s sister was the perfect family man. We’weren’d spend time by ourselves. One afternoon, I was out on a date—a small one. We were on our own. We decided that we would walk down the middle of the street, past all the other people on their lunch break. The road was not even a few feet from the front door. My dad walked up to us and handed his mother a bottle of water to drink. I took it. She took her first sip and then she stopped. Then she turned around and asked, “Dad! I think we should get inside your apartment”“ I took my first sip. There was no hesitation, no hesitation, no question. It was just the natural, organic, delicious, delicious thing she’d always made us: a glass of water. “Thank you” was the way we liked it. I drank one. It was almost half full. Then the second I tasted the bitter stuff my mouth wasn’t what’d it ever been? It wasn’t what you’d call it. I remember that glass of water very well, and for the next few years, I never forgot that day in the middle of summer, that night in our backyard. When we turned on the tap my entire life the other day it was not working. This thing, it’s been working right from the start! I had a chance to try something else. I walked outside the house to try some of the freshly cut grass and grass, and here I was at home, on a warm and sunny day, in my mother's kitchen, with my dad, my sister, my nephew—it had never been like that before.’This was the first time I’d been out for a walk. And at any rate, my sister was going back into work. So after an hour-and-a-half she came back at me with a few questions about my sister. She started. She asked, “What did her parents tell her about your situation?” It was a long period—two years and a year and a year and a year—when we were the poorest in our town. I had always been a really good kid growing up. My brothers and my friends and my cousins—everybody in our school was rich in my eyes. The people at my school were all middle-class and working-class people; so were my whole town. People from all walks of life. In my house, there’s always a big tree. If you get in your front yard, you’ll see it with your garden and its branches and all of its flowers. Every single summer, we plant a tree. The trees here are always at least one year older than ours, growing and turning into a new plot of land for us. It’s a beautiful thing. Sometimes we’can grow vegetables in a corner of our backyard, and here in that year we’can grow everything we need for dinner: tomatoes, radishes, herbs. You’ll have a nice garden all year round, but at the end of the year, it’s not like there is an incredible bounty of food to take home. I like that. I can plant a tree; you can walk on it. But here, in my backyard with the trees on top, it didn’t feel like there was a lot of space; it felt like I got in a lot of dirt and had to put it out—the same as in any other home or at least my life. It wasa house, it had an owner who was a person you could talk to, but also a lot of people from that house that were like, 'What's going on with you? What do you need? Let's just get rid of it.' There was no one to talk or anyone around or someone to help. That was the end of that. The house was my home forever. At least, my home now; now it was mine alone. I couldn’t take a step outside of it, not even for a moment to walk back or get a change of clothes on. I couldn’t move about freely, could not walk back to any house in the city. I was at the end of that time, the place that I loved more, my home and my childhood home. The house went up in flames on a Tuesday afternoon in early April. I lived with my grandmother and her parents in the house they had at the time when the fire started. It had all this beautiful white stuff in it, the kind of white with the grass and the tree, the kind of white you could run around in. They’haved it all in a day and it was just grass, the soil, the ground. One night my grandfather called and said, “What happened?” My eyes widened, and then I felt my mom coming over to me and crying at the top of her lungs. My eyes were so wide I couldn’t see her. I started crying. I was so devastated that my mom came over to see me; when there is always somebody there to help, I needed somebody. “My baby, my grandson's baby,” she said. “You need somebody to run this town right now.” “Yeah..?” She started crying again, and then my other grandparents came over. They were the ones who had to go and take my hand and tell the community’s government that they need to start moving to a different part of the city of Makhalomani in a new country; the land we’oldly call Makhalaya in the area of Khakassiya, where there are no people from the past. So I was with them for over an hour, getting the government to get its act together and help rebuild this entire city of some of the worst human rights and civil liberties abuses I have ever seen. There were some issues with the electricity, a few minor things, the roof of our house, some of the streets. My mom got it fixed, and all the power was restored. It took a bit longer than that. But eventually, we started. Our house was up and running again, and now it was just me and my older brother—a five-year-old brother, one of the nicest kids you could have—running around in the yard, playing and laughing and playing on my sister-in-law’s porch, and playing on my mom’s lawn. We had a small backyard now: a patch of grass and a few houses. My family and the neighborhood lived in a shanty-town; all the land the government had taken from us back in the 70s just went into the ground. I’d walk back and forth for an hour on the grass, then I’d run back to the house, grab the little one, put him in the garage, and go outside, play. I wasn’t allowed out in the streets. This new, different area, it was my whole world for the day: the street, the houses, the cars. I had to be at my house from eight to ten at least; I couldn’t be on my phone all the time; every time I needed a charger my mom would stop by. But for some reason my little brother didn’t want me, or my dad, because they were such busy kids, the two of them, that the house was their lives. I’d stay in my room, go outside, hang out with them on the front porch, take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city—that was the day I was a dad. At least, during the first couple months after the fire. In the weeks leading up to the fire, we worked full-Time on our backyard. And that was the day the fire actually did come. It wasn’t that bad, it really wasn’t—I got the fire under control and in a few days we were back on schedule. It started when a piece of our carpet got caught in a tree. If it hadn’t been for that, the fire wouldn’t have been a problem. But as with any house fire, there were so many things that couldhave gone wrong with this carpet, including an underappreciated hazard: smoke. The worst thing about the fire was the smoke it was bringing. In this case, the only reason it didn’t go as far as a complete house fire is that we had the means to run the fire out before that. We made a fire, and that was all that was left. But now, I had to deal with another burning issue: The fire had damaged the carpet. I remember the night the fire happened like it happened yesterday, from that moment on my life, I was burned at every corner. In the days afterwards, my mother brought me an apple out of the garden. I don’t remember anything else that ever happened around that time. I don’t remember what happened, and my memories of the incident have never been very good. But I do remember the apple. It was an apple, but my mother loved it so much and thought it had something to do with the tree. So we would eat it in the garden. At least we could take a bite: it was an apple and another apple. There was no doubt that the garden in Grosvêné was the best place in village for her, and for the kids, in general. This was not some country town. This was a place where everyone was very polite. There was no violence; there had been little or no fighting in the years, save for occasional car accidents. I didn’t believe in that whole notion that you could be a rebel and be the best country-music artist in the world, or, for that matter, that you can change the whole country of Europe and everyone’s culture forever. When I grew up it never occurred to anyone that people would react to our music like this, this is the thing that everyone’s talking about. You would be the first song of the night for your favorite band, and then people’would be in a mad rush all afternoon, and not one of them was going to play the fucking song at the first note. When it came time for us to play, my mother went through the songs we had at home, playing a couple of times. They’were the ones that everyone would hear, the ones that everyone’s favorite band was playing at the club. Then in the middle of the performance one of those girls in our band started rapping: the most beautiful woman alive at that age, a musician, a talented singer, a fantastic voice, and the most beautiful woman in the world, a musician who could be a member of that band. The other musicians in the gig were a mix of white, and some black and some white, and some black and some white. Everyone’s eyes were on her. One minute, she was the only woman in the band, the next minute, her hair was all over my mother’s face and there wasn’t a hint. When my mom got to be 25 years old, I was the oldest of five kids. At least that meant that in between me and my younger brother, my younger brother would be the only son she had with my stepdad, but that was a small comfort: we’d have my dad and him in the house, with me whenever and wherever we wanted to be. This was my home, and for the first time in my life I felt like I had a home on earth. In other words, for the whole season there would be no reason to go on the road to go play at another band’s live show, no reason for me to see or do anything but hang out with my sister and my cousins on Saturday afternoons. My brother was the only one on my mom’s side, the only one on the other end with her. But what I found was a new reality, the reality that if my brother went to see the concert I’d be on the road with my mom. She’d be the one playing. It wasn’t so much our friendship as it was her friendship with the band, the people they invited us to see. I didn’t have the slightest idea who these white men or women were or where these white families were from. I never’got the chance to meet them, or the people in them. I had to go meet these people for the first time. And for my mom, it turned out not that great, at least on the surface at least. For one thing, I was not a good conversationalist. If someone asked a question and I didn’t have an answer. If somebody pointed me in the right direction and I didn’t know how to follow his lead and I couldn’tsee his point of view. If my reaction was an extreme example of the worst I could happen to be, or the worst in my life, or maybe the worst thing that happened in my life. I didn’t know what to do. I was like, I don’t want that. I would rather be with my mom. And they were my only family. We could do this. We could be the best friends on Earth. That was our life for the most part: A big family, lots of cooking, lots and lots of eating, lots of sitting in the kitchen, lots of games. Sometimes we’d play video games, like some sort of platform title, Call of Duty. We were all in a war that had to do with our family. That was one of our favorite games; you had a bunch of kids playing it and it was the most fun they had in years, which meant the most they got from it was their time in line for a medal, or their phone calls from their mom. I’d be up in my bed and the sounds of the games would be all around me—not just the sounds of my favorite team games, these guys' favorite games—and I could be playing for a whole hour, with no internet. Then I would go downstairs. There would be my mom cooking. Then there would be the sounds of the kids playing, and then the sounds of my mom cooking. It would be a whole hour of nothing but us sitting at the stove. That was the thing that would bring me back out from the dead: She knew my whole life, and she’d do anything for them. In my eyes, she was my closest friend. It would be that day, when one of the boys at school came home from school and said he had a crush on his mother, that would be my moment—I’d get a crush, too. That’s when the whole thing would end with him telling her that, because she didn’t like him. And this will always be my first impression: I’d be lying to my parents all day and never have a hint that I had this crush on them. Because of my mom, I can say the truth—I would have them. Because of her, I learned a valuable lesson: If you have a crush on a woman and she won’t change, then that woman is going to change. The way women are all these times, where they will do anything for you, including giving you a date on the first date? No. Don’t do that. Don’t do that, no matter. It will just be you at the grocery store. Or your mom at work. No. No. I’d stop there; I would be just fine with that. But every few months she’d call and we would have the entire morning together to figure out the next move for the date. My dad would take me aside one morning and, in that brief, private moment, he told me what an amazing woman I could be. There were no words between us. It was the best thing ever. My dad came into my life the second I’d been in a relationship with anyone for less than a year. After years of getting on the same page with my mom, it was clear that it was time for something more significant than that. My dad had two grown-ups by his side. He knew everything there was to know about the relationship: everything from the details of the marriage (that she would never leave him) to the details of the relationship itself. He’d listen patiently to my mom and give her feedback on her decisions so I wouldn’t end up getting divorced—a common scenario in his home. But, even though he and my mom could always find a way to get along, at some point in their lives our paths had become too far apart—we decided our paths would be even more different. I would follow him as his surrogate father-in-law; he would have me as his only childlike, perfect father-in-law at home, and an even more perfect son-in-law in the office. If I became a father, he and my mom would take on his whole role: He would be the man on his children”s behalf. But I couldn’t. Not today. When I had my period I couldn’t have been with my dad for a baby shower or any other family moment, not to be with him for a party or an after-party with his daughter or his granddaughter. And then there is that, the time during a family crisis or another family problem that you have a moment alone with yourmother. My mother did not want me to be like all the other boys. Or like other boys. There were not any exceptions to the rule for her. There would be some boys she did not like from time to time, some at least at the elementary or middle levels I would take a good look at. But she never treated that like a problem. She treated that like a part of being part of the family, which I did not get. Because when people say that the family is the most important in life, it really isn’t true. The family doesn’t define it at all. It doesn’t define your existence, because I never understood that at all. And I remember that at home in the house in the family, every morning my mom woke me up and walked me outside. I didn’t want any part of life inside the house. This was their yard. We lived with them as best friends. In their home on a huge property in one of the most important places on earth. The forest on which our ancestors grew their food and raised their livestock. My mother loved that place. I hated that house. The trees and the grass. I got along with my grandfather on many different levels. After my mom died, in 1996, the government decided to take over our village. In an effort to rebuild what had been destroyed, the government decided to build a new village full of people—from the poor to the rich. We had the chance to be part of that and that was our answer. For two years, I spent my first summer with our cousin's family there. It was a beautiful place to just chill and be with them. I wasnt much of an outdoorsman growing up. I didn’t have any interest in hiking and biking, no interest in exploring—just hanging out in the backyards with our grandparents and my grandma and my grandpa—and having a great time just hanging out with them. So when my family moved to a new village, one full of people, I was in the middle of the action, my family, my friends, my cousins, my grandpa. The village had a great lake, a beautiful garden, a lot of green, and a great park. My cousins and my mom were all very active in the local community—as were my cousins, my brothers, my son, my daughter. At the same time, the new people were the most accepting I had ever been on the street in my life. The new people did not want any of us to be like the old, you know? It was like we were on a mission to clean up the streets and bring the old into the new. And one of those days in the garden, as I was cleaning a little rose bush, the sun was so intense in the sky—the whole place was bathed in sunlight. It was perfect. I pulled up in my mother’s car. My car was always super convenient, it was always the first thing on my mom’s doorstep if I needed it. There was no running water or a running yard because my mom bought her own. In an effort to help us manage the little things, I was always with her in the car on the way home from work: cleaning, cooking, getting groceries, shopping, whatever. Then when we got home from work, we’d get in the car to clean and cook. When we woke up one morning we looked out the window. It was really just a few scattered flowers and a few little green branches hanging from some bushes in front of the house. I went back into the house. The next day we had another big party—this one at my aunt’s house. We had a great barbecue, one of the biggest in North Carolina. And then, the next evening we had a nice dinner at our friend’s house. That was it. That was my first party at home without the family. I had never been a big socialite growing up. I was the kind of kid who would get into bars and hang out and then go back to my mom’s house for a quick dinner. We’d get our favorite food, like French fries or chicken. Sometimes they’would be fried with some kind of mayonnaise, and sometimes they wouldn’t be. But that was one night, there wasn’t a mayo, there wasn’t a mayo. All of a sudden I became a celebrity at home, at home. It felt amazing. I didn’t know anyone there, and I didn’t know anything about them. It was all me. For the first time, I felt like I belonged, that all of us were connected, and everyone cared about them, like we hada whole person, not just the people I was with. I never wanted to join up with them any more than my mom, my brother, my stepfather, or one of my cousins had when I was growing up, where everyone—including mine—was part of the family in some sense. The one thing we knew—what you just did, that’s who you were. We could have been in any world, any time. But because of the constant pressure and the power imbalance of an adult relationship, every once in a while—if I could just be with her for half an hour—for the first time I found myself with my dad and my older brother, who were the only people who seemed to be like, “How could we be like this?” We weren’t. I got to do what they didn’t want me to do: Be with them every night at a time, day and night —even when my dad wasn’t home or there wasn’t any TV or nothing. But for the first time in my life, it didn’t feel like his presence in the house at night was a part of who he was. It wasn’t like he was like, “I will be there for all your needs. Please just stay up with us.” No. It didn’t feel like they were like, “This is your Dad. Please be with us.” It felt like every time my dad’s mom would come in, my dad would just be like, “What, like a friend?” It wasn’t like she was going, “I need your blessing. The things you do don’t bother me. If you need something from our family, don’t tell her. We’ll take your problems upon ourselves. We are more special.” And that was that. The only thing that didn’t change for me over those four years—and the only thing that’s so much harder than this one thing going exactly as it was going—is that after four years, I felt like I had never really had any friends. I had a bunch of distant relatives, some very nice people, who were the ones that I would hang out with and hang out with, but there was no one in my life who I had any real interest in. I thought of those people as a club. A big party, maybe, with lots of alcohol and some nice food; but when it got dark, my mom would make the decision. If someone was having a bad night, I was the one going to hang out and go party.” “No, mom! This is something we should do together—“a group.” The only thing I didn’t get was the basic—you just hang?” That was the one thing that I didn’t get. It was just me hanging, hanging with everyone. The people were friends, and I was hanging with them. They were hanging with us. There was nothing awkward about that. There were no awkward or awkward moments. It was like every night at the club, somebody came to hang out with the other people. “This guy here is a total douche.” “Oh, he was with the police? There was never any evidence of that?” I was never the target of that. In school, there was always a rumor that my friend was cheating on his fianc�d­‑s boyfriend. It was a terrible stereotype of black people, a stereotype that was true. But it didn’t seem believable. After all of that, for some reason it never came to fruition, and it was something I didn’t feel like confronting: “Hey, I got a black guy!” I didn’t understand that. In high school, my mom and a number of the black and brown girls at my school went to a dance in Harlem on a beautiful summer's night. It was a great night. There was no cover charge—we were all free. It had all of the best-known dance-hall artists—Rikki Smith, Yolanda Foster—and the greats from across the continent, like Niki and Mimi. People were dancing; dancing at breaks in the song; singing along and dancing along to the music. They were all dancing like it was a party. It was a great night for everybody—it seemed like a party at that point in time. So we went up. We danced to "All Night"; to "All Your Fault"; to "Shake It"; to "The Man"; to a few of thesongs from "Satisfaction." You could see people dancing and talking in high spirits. I didn`t need to be here to be able to care for them or hold up those DJ�”​s when they were done: The DJ. I couldn’t care and stay and watch as I watched them. The DJ was in the middle of setting up his set on the floor. It was at that point that I realized that I didn’t have one. I didn—t remember anything about that night. This is a day I wish my parents would have been more like: They got us through this together. They were strong, thoughtful, generous people—some of the best. I never saw my parents grow up with that kind of love and affection: Their relationships with their kids were based on the power and responsibility of their marriage. And they lived the lives, not only for their children, but also for themselves. They went to such effort to be what they wanted to be for their children, they weren’t there to be a surrogate father or any of that, either. They were like, “We just want kids, as long as the parents choose to be like us. We will be a family.” This is what my mom always spoke to me: We never let a relationship stand in the way of our love. We take it to the next level. She taught me: “When we find out a man has a wife, what you do is you say: “Here is this man. Let me take the responsibility, I have to do whatever I can to change your life. Because I love every minute of this man's life so much. Let me change that woman’s life.' Because our relationship was one of the main reasons I was at that party for the first time ever in my life—and that was my first time I knew that there were other people out there, in a whole different world, with just as beautiful a woman as me. So I was completely changed. So am I. But my parents didn’t give up on their dream of making a great-grandchild into a great-grandmother themselves; I was the ultimate example of why they shouldn't have been. It was one of the first times in my childhood that my parents realized that their life—their life of being a team of professionals with their families—was not for them. They’d become a real family: A real family with a real set of expectations, a real family with just one mother, their own schedule with their own lives; it didn’t change. There was an understanding at least that I was in control of myself, and I would manage my life. If what I liked didn’t work out or we’d need a second opinion, my mom would be the person to take my place: The person who’d make me feel like there was somebody out there with a bright future. And she was—her advice was the best advice. If I was the girl in the club who wasn’t good, the whole group would take it upon themselves to find me a girl good. That was my first step toward becoming the woman on their radar: a woman they could hang with no problem. They’d say, “If someone can hang with us, we will hang with them.” I was the girl they could hang with no problem, and my parents would say, �Don’t worry. The world doesn’t need this girl at all. We will deal with it.” That was probably the best advice their entire lives. My mother taught me how important it was to have your mother with you, in everything. She taught me to do the same. “If your mother can, please, please, please let her become a mother.” I learned how to be the best version of myself; to get that, I simply walked on by myself. I didn’t need any parents to be there for support. I could have my father and my younger brother with me. My dad, of course, knew all the right ways to deal with that; my mom didn’t care. They weren’t the best at dealing with that. They wanted things to be different; they wanted them to be different: They had some great advice for it; I took a pass with it. I wanted my father to be my mentor, my man-manager, my mentor-in-training, my best teacher. But they couldn’t be there for me. “Don’t be that father who tells you all how to do everything yourself and then says he is a man and should take it uponhimself? He did me a service today.” At that time, one of his favorite things to do was walk around the back streets in his pink Cadillac. He would sit on his front porch and listen to people talk. He took these pictures of us and we went up to his house. When his mother asked him what he knew about the world, he’d point us to a book on China that he had bought. We went and bought this for our mother. Then in an instant, all our life experience about that country went out the window. If you want to know what happened to me at my earliest years, you have to go in, and you have to tell your story. “We never wanted this at home. We never could understand why we were being watched and everything. We loved us very much here, but we were always the kids of the wealthy. I learned not to trust any rich person. If a guy from the street says he is rich, I can tell you for a fact right off that—that man or woman is nothing more than a scion of a family, one of these rich old guys from the top level who happens to be the richest man in Asia. I would be very disappointed in that man if we’d ever seen him. In fact, I would be very, very disappointed if we’d ever seen him at all. But the rich kids at home were never like that. The rich kids at home were, as the saying went, too smart to be dumb. That was true for my entire childhood, and I knew it for years to come. But I never had that luxury in my home country. I could walk around freely every day, taking my dad's advice, and I would not be watched, my father would not be in danger. There were times, when my mother would say, “We should go back to having fun,” he’d say, “but this time—this time,” he’d say, “let them have fun.” But I knew a man who loved us even on days when it was hard. So at any rate, I loved him. My dad loved his boys. My father always loved his boys, but there were certain days where he could not be with me the whole time. There was one week he didn’t come home after work. I was at school, and I had an exam in a few hours—it was my final year. But the whole house had gone up and was packed with people, so it’d be quiet in the house at work all day. It was the end of lunch and already in the morning I was late at school, late in class—too late on the exam. I wasn’t ready for this; I was too stressed. But I wasn't ready for it. My mom was the kindest woman I knew. She would get me out of any moment. So would my sister, Dadiya. “Dadi, can we get you in and play,” she’d say, “for the fun of it?” Dadiya would get my daughter a pair of pink yoga pants and a pair of pink tennis shoes, and so on. At home Dadiya was my all-time best friend. We’d hang out and do stuff. I would ask my dad why Dadiya didn’t go to university and his answer would be the same, that she’d rather be in the kitchen working or at home, being with her kids. That’s when they’m not at home doing their own homework, doing the chores. He’d say to her, “But, my daughter would like that.” I was not as much of a fan of Dadiya as I was of my sister, not because I had a hard time with her and wasn’t attracted to her as a child. But Dadiya was my stepmother and my best maternal figure on earth at every step of her life. She always treated us as equals, and I was the kid, and so was she. We were the same age. No one got left behind. It was that good, too—the first year of growing up with my mom after my cousin had left for Japan and all the Japanese kids in their 20s and 30s were here with their parents.“I had a crush on them all along. It was that year when a Japanese guy, a guy who wasn’t much younger, came to live in North Korea, and we had a girl with another guy from Korea, and we went off the road for four months in the middle of nowhere andall the time I spent taking walks. My mom would take us to eat and we'd go back to this little hut outside the village, and that day a man came and helped build a house – one that he could have in his home. Our little shack was a shack. It was two shacks. A one-room shack. But here in the village, we had the ability to create something better from nothing. The second we got the house, my dad took a couple of men and a woman. My mom took care of us. They brought our entire extended family over. They became my extended family, the extended family of my great-grandmother's village. My grandparents had given that village everything – and I didn’t really know what else. My grandparents didn’t have any other family. My great-grandparents couldn’t get over being in our neighborhood – that was one of the few things we could count on. And if my great-grandparents ever needed us, I was their only answer. If something happened to me, my great-grandparents would be right there behind me, helping me out. My dad, who was the only man in my life who knew where a gun was for him…it was that simple. I was the only boy in their lives who felt like, I can do anything with a gun. I was, by that time, twelve or thirteen years old. So, I made the only call. "Dad…" My dad looked at me with a look you wouldn’t want to see on a person’s face. The gun. There was no other reason for me to come down and help him build a house with my dad. In the summer we had gone camping, to an area of the Korean border that was no longer in use for any military, and my dad brought his family with him. That was their first chance in the United States. My brother-in-law, my father, my cousins. We stayed in the house in the middle of nowhere. I was left as his only housekeeper, doing chores that needed doing, cooking, cleaning – which by that time my mom, my cousins, my brother-in-law, my sister, and my grandmother would all be out on their own, on their own, doing their own thing. I didn’t know what I could have done more, but I never said no – because I was lucky. My mom was my best friend, she would take care of the kids. I was always the only human in the family. I was the only one on the street, the only one at school. My dad always used to be the only one telling me how to be a man. I don’t think my parents saw all of the things that were in my life that they could have done if my brother—the only man in the house—had been there for them every step of the way, as they went through all the ups, the downs, the highs. My brothers would go and tell the story, and one of them would tell me I couldn’t let myself be like them in every single way. My mom would take the boys to get their hair done, and my brother-in-law would be like, “That’s what men do, they get in the car and they take it somewhere.” That’s how I became a man. That was the way it was supposed to be for the last three generations. My dad loved to tell the story. And that was the story my mom loved to tell me, as well—the whole story of how a boy from a poor family in his youth came up through the ranks of the best-paid men in the world and rose through the ranks with a fortune of his own on top of everything else he did in his life. For me to learn from his story and grow up with this man—the future president—it was like the universe gave me a gift to learn from it and appreciate it and learn from it and use it for the rest of my life. My mom was the reason I learned from her. I went to live with her in the Soweto district in the early '90s. My mom was the only single parent in my life, as her youngest son, whom she was raising, was an only child and the family shared a house. And for three years, she was the only one who could take care of the kids. The only woman in our lives, my mom was in charge. But when my mom got pregnant, my mom had an idea she wanted to do. And this woman, this woman, this woman was very ambitious. The idea for our house came out of her work at a steel plant, where they had a lot ofwaste. And the idea for our house came out of my work as a construction contractor. We were working on a home for sale. The house was in the industrial section of town where you get factory floors, all the way up to where someone built a whole new house there years ago. One day a woman I had known in our company for a number of years came back to work at this steel mill and started to notice that all of the women in there were all hot. I knew right away, “This woman is hot! I'm going to have to get with her” So I began asking around, starting with the women in my area and my wife, the people in their yards, the women in their cities and wherever we thought they might be in an emergency—at home, at work. I told them we were going to take a trip out to this house to take a look inside the home, and that is how they decided: “No, no, please don’t go. You need us to do a little housework. We”ll clean your place. That’s all. This man is a real gentleman.” I was so taken by surprise that I didn.t think about it. I had only been with a woman for a few months when this woman came back from the steel mill. But I wasn’t in any hurry to break off our long-term relationship. I didn’t have much in the way of options, other than to try to be her on-and-off-again confidante, which I was. At some point the relationship was going to change, or she couldn’t get any closer to him. It was going to be like we never got along at all—nowhere near the friendship level. But it didn’t. It felt like she was always there for him, waiting for any excuse to go along with his mood swings of anger and sadness. It felt like she was never there to help him with everything that wasn’t on her. They had a great relationship during that time. He would always say he was very sorry if there was anything that happened between us that he could have done differently. I always said, ‹If he was not as upset about not being friends with me as I was, at least I could take him at his word that it was over, and that he would have been better friends with me and not with his girlfriend. I didn’t believe that. I felt that he needed her to forgive her. This woman’s family made the decision that was for them, and they’ took it. She’s been a wonderful person. If people can’t figure out how to live without the man that they adore, that is their problem, not theirs to fix. But her father, the man she loved with all her heart—his love for her has never wavered. His heart, not hers, will prevail. He did not have any other option. He did not want her to go into the world, to live with her, live with him in his castle in the woods outside Brabant. The only person who could help them with that was him, who was not his parents. They were the man she’d love, but his life was a mess. There were times my father would come home from work and start crying when I was with a friend for dinner. There was nothing we could do. I was his only connection, his surrogate. I could have gone out and bought himself a bottle of wine, maybe some beer. But I knew that the man, my entire being—his whole being—would be the drink. He would be the one to make it. I thought of all the people I knew in my life—their stories, their struggles, all of their pain—and I knew all of them would be with me in the moment I needed them to be. The only person who was more important to me was him. My mom didn’t know me. She’d told me once, ‵I never trusted the people who would cheat. There’s a fine line between honesty and dishonesty,” But my mom didn’t believe that line. She was all for honesty. “I know when my dad’s not honest the people in our lives are not honest as well.” I could tell you that all my life. I’d hear it all the time, the way my mom would tell me: “Don’t tell the truth. The truth is what you will have as a witness and not as a witness.” My mom would tell me all the time, “It is not important. The truthwill set the record straight. That will be your moment to set it straight. You have three options: you can accept that the truth will hurt you; you can accept that the truth is your best defense; or, you can keep playing the game.“ If you didn’t know that in my mother’s eyes, you had the greatest defense. It was like she said, every mother knows, “The only thing more dangerous than a liar,” is a liar who tells the whole truth. I always thought that my mom would have done more to get me out of danger than anything else. When I found out what happened, and the two cops on our corner were not going to help me at all, I told her, “I have no faith in anyone›s ability to change.— There was no turning back from this. Our lives would never be the same, no. We’wouldn’never be the same. I was never good at hiding my fear — it was never an issue that even a little bit of fear could turn us against, that the world would turn against us. I was never afraid of getting caught. In my first year in the police academy, the instructor had been through some tough training days during which he had been in a firing squad. He’d tell us how he’d shoot a gunman in the back of the head. “You have to shoot straight in the head —” That was it. We weren’d learn to defend ourselves, and then, if we’didn’t defend ourselves…I was like, “Why don’t you go play some games instead? You know how badly that would make you feel? You know what that’s all about? You know what happens if you don’t fight back? You’d stay at the front of the line, fight back and be in charge of your own.” Then we got another week with the military, a week of boot camp, and another week of a whole lot of shooting and training. I got out of this boot camp at least three weeks early. It’s not like anyone could afford to give me the physical therapy my mom was pushing for—it wouldn’t have helped my injury or any kind of physical weakness for that matter. She’d been pushing for it all along. I started on that physical therapy and did my best to stay fit, but by the time training for and during the season was over I had already put on ten pounds, nearly seven, and there wasn’t anything else to do, like I never had anything to do with any of the martial arts classes. I went up to the front to do some drills for the team from the ground to the air, then ran back to the dormitories for a final fight or two. In my time at BYU, one of the most important decisions I made was making a decision. I needed a break from the military, especially because my senior year of high school was drawing to a close, and to make that change I needed a year to sort out all of those things that I loved the military and wanted to do—that was not an option. It would have been so easy for me to go back to college straight away, but if my mom had known that, she probably would have made the choice more carefully. I knew that her decision was hers. She had one year left to spend with this guy, with another year to get me in line for college—but if she and her family could take more of a risk and get me out of the military—then there wouldn’t be anything left for us to worry about once graduation came around. But this was my life now. I never wanted to give it up for a man's cause or my country, my life. It had been ten years of the worst and best of what men could be. I knew there was no point in waiting for the next war, the next crisis, the next disaster; every time I felt like I wasn’t going to do something, I just wanted it to continue. So instead I took the military on a field expedition to look at how the troops on a mission were dealing with everyday life. This was the Army. My whole first tour was in the South Pacific, in the Philippines. At home, I was in the kitchen with my mom, my aunt, my uncle, my grandmother—everybody together. I got home on Sundays, but by that point we had moved out of my sister-in‐law’s house. When this army unit started going to pick up the troops in the Philippines, they were not supposed to beinside my sister-in‑law’s house, not in fact not in any home in that part of Pampanga. That house that a lot of us had rented out for other family members while we’d been in and out, my mom’s house. It had a yard where we set up a small garden; my sister-in‑law’s house at the end of the road, where we’d hang out, cook; the back patio — you’d never have to leave. The garden had grass and flowers and trees, and you couldn’t even hang lamps by the street. We had no electricity — no running water — and I had to keep it on by myself. My mom would clean it, but my grandmother was a very strict homemaker — she’d take it upon herself if there was any problem. If that were the end of it, my mother would clean up and go down to our father’s house, put on a suit, go down to the street, take her son to get her a cup of tea. There were no running water, no electricity. My mother’s father brought home the electric to the house, for the bedroom. My dad had a small, one room that hed share with his sister, his niece, my mother. We stayed there for all the summer. The summer was a wonderful time, too. The first time my dad went home, this year, he was a lot happier than I had been before. It was a beautiful summer day, and as my mom was finishing all her work, he came over. He came in to check on us, and as we watched as he walked down the street, I took him into his living room to meet his sister. My mom didn’t want to bring her mother down to the house. She didn’t want us to be at that. So we stayed at my father’s, my cousin's house. There were two white people living at this house. My dad came over to see her, and my mom came with her. We sat down, and my mom said, “You don’t want to stay here. The house is your uncle’s, but your grandparents don’t think so. They think it’s better for them to stay here.‬ She wasn’t trying to be dramatic. “I know,” she told me. “Because I know what my father was like when he had his first child, I know what it feels like when a cousin or a relative gives birth to their grandson. That kid grew up in those moments.” Afterward, as he was leaving the house to meet his sister, my mom said “I‐m going down on my knees and asking God to bless him with the best manhood in the world.” God, I couldn’t believe it. This man, this guy, this whole family, they were going to give him an ultimatum? This was the most important thing in their lives? I didn’t understand what a woman had to do to give such such a simple prayer like that. I got so upset all through the night that I called my mother and said, “Mom, I can’t wait to be with him for Mass when we have the time. I need to ask God to bless this man.” The next morning, after the funeral, my mother drove me back into the village, with our two little girls in her car, to go see our brother, the pastor at the church she would always go to. I was a new convert, but at this church, people weren’t going to come to their services and hear from a man they didn’t like or someone who wasn’t the person who they saw with their own eyes every day, that’s not their church. He had brought the church back to life in a positive way. I remember him as a guy, a person, and not a man. The pastor said the church needed to do more of what it was known for, and he said, “Here, we’ll have the best men at the church come out to play for us. And we’re going to play for two hours.” My husband came and got us into a band, a band we loved, a band the whole family was into. It was a great show for two days, and my mom was super grateful I didn’t get a break at that point. I can still look at my mom as a woman who always knew what was best for her, and I can tell you theone thing she never once asked her sons: Why can't you be like your grandmother? Why can't you be like your great grandmother? They said: You are such a great son that we can live in a world that never has a daughter. That, I can tell you, was the best answer for one of them. “Because it is impossible to have as a woman a man who doesn’t be the man that we were taught to be by our father,” he told us. It was a lesson I never forgot. One day my friend, “Mike” and his sister were sitting at a friend’s table, and “We’d decided that we wanted to have kids.” I was the youngest man in our family — but my brother, who was a great man as well, was at his wit’s with his sister,” and his wife told us to get our stuff together. We went out to a car. We pulled the car over. We walked over to Mike’s old Volkswagen and his sister”s old Volkswagen and got our things, and then, right there in the middle of the backyard, we were out on the road in full force, racing, joking, playing games, all of our fathers. At dinner one night we were having a meal together. “There is no such thing as a boy’s dinner —‛I―bama’s,” my mom’s,”’s,”mansion.” The only thing my mom liked from the moment she got married to her first husband, my dad was always there to serve it to us. He always had his fingers in the pies.” “This is my dad doing a better job than I am ever going to do.” I was in tears, but my dad was not, no matter how much things changed for him, in any way did change for me when my sister was still his sister. I had a great relationship with my father from an early age: He gave back to his country, his family, to all of the people in need. He was a man of strength and determination. I had that for the longest time. My dad told me that I was a son and not his baby. That he was the father of my children, that they were going to be with him forever, that he was going to support all of them—that he was a father figure, someone to call home. I felt like I had never experienced anything similar at home. On the outside, I was the big, black, ugly stepchild (my father had his own kids). Then on the inside, I was the big, beautiful, happy, white, strong-willed, smart-aleck family. “This is exactly how my mom wanted it.” If the other kids at our house weren’t as good with computers as my mom was with children’s books, if she wouldn’t have taken us to her favorite movie, if we didn’t play with our toys as much as they did, if she never played with us as much as we played with our toys as much, if the other kids knew they could do anything. “My mom’s greatest talent was the ability to stay close, to be with me for the whole of the day, and never leave.” I would never leave home. My mother would never leave and never leave my father, never leave her. Her last word on my birthday was a single, powerful phrase: “We should go be with our mother. Her son will be my son”s son. My dad’s last word was a line that we all know by heart: My dad’s not in my life. That was our relationship from the time my mom took him back when he was four years and three months, his sixth-birthday, to his final year as a man in prison in 2002: She took him under her wings and raised him—and he was very much in her heart and soul, my mom. I remember when I was a small child, before my mom came home from work to pick me up in a car with some of her friends from the neighborhood, my cousin had given me a big book. At first my mom didn’t understand it. I couldn’t read it. It told us that one man had created an organization—the National Woman of Courage Foundation—and that another man had created an organization—the Women's Defense Initiative. But I had never experienced anything like that before. At home, my mother would give me the biggest book. I was a baby and the cover of the book could bea picture of a man or a woman. The picture would be of a handsome man. I never had any inkling at home that there was a problem. I remember one night, after my mother had read the book and was ready for bed, I went outside to play on my cellphone while the boys were playing. I was playing one of those games called Tetris—a game where you throw the ball. At times it would look like the ball might bounce off the top of a building, but at other times my balls were the color of a person's skin. I was like a kid—the ball would bounce in a circle, the dots would change color, and I would get that special feeling from those dots: They would change color based in on the color of my skin. It was just another piece of my childhood experience: a time I was so young I didn’t know how to be a man. And I didn’t know how to be an adult. I didn’t understand any of the rules or responsibilities of being a man. If I was a little kid and my mom didn’t say no, it would be a perfect situation. If she told me no? Well, I couldn’t change my mother. The thing I hated in life is when my mom told me when I could do, I could do it. I didn’t want my daddy to be the one deciding what I could be. That was always their way: They told me, “If anyone can change your life, it can be you. You just have to find out how to make it,‘ and if I had been the kid running at such a fast pace that I could break all the record for the fastest time for a half-hour and I could run a half-marathon in under an hour, I could have been the man of the hour. I was an athlete. My mom was an athlete as well. My first year in high school my mom took me to the track and the track was the best thing I ever did for my life, and for a year thereafter it was my main way of escaping from home—for the track and for running in the track. I raced a few times, but by the time I got to my junior year I got really good and I wanted to run more. For one thing, in the track—for one race a year—I wasn’t allowed. The only time you were allowed to race in the track was in the team sports: swimming and track and field and track and field, the Olympics. But for the most part in all things athletics, the track was just the boys' club. It was just the one group of boys hanging out together who’d hang out during breaks from work to hang out—that was it. It was not a real group, and it was a very small group. It was like everyone just hung out at the bar. There’s no real-time video of those guys hanging out at bars or drinking and hanging out, but they were always drinking—just one drink in, one drink out, I would find them somewhere on the dance floor and I’d grab the mic. I used it for my own jokes and everything. I never let you know that my routine at this bar was that we were like, “Here, you need to learn to dance; dance, dance, dance. We will get you ready; this dance is for your friends to dance, and they can watch you dance all night long on TV the same night.” They had been drinking in the park the whole time; my mom would have two bottles of vodka and an entire bottle of Vodka and a can of Coke all the time. So I would be up there and I would walk through their path, and then I would go back the way I had left them and they just wouldn’t stop dancing. That was just us being us, and I never forgot that. There were times when my mom wouldn‹t even let us stop and sit and watch the dancers. She would get a little upset, take over, and start yelling in my face—and no, I didn’t want that. When one person breaks a rule, that’s their problem.” We’d stay up all night dancing until we got home, my wife getting excited about the new dance moves the night before, my mom getting on her computer, and everyone sitting around the kitchen enjoying a glass of wine with the girls from school, then we’d come back in the morning, sit down at a table and get ready for school. It’s so good to feel like it’s your school.” I never had a fatherfigure. “I don’t remember anyone in my life who was as supportive of me and my education than my father in every aspect. I always knew that this was my one and only chance to be whatever I wanted to be. I couldn’t have it that way. It was my choice. He made the call. As much as I hate to admit it, I got a little too close to my dad for his benefit. It always felt like if he’d just be there and be like a father, I wouldn’t have all the problems in the world to deal with. I don’t remember my dad going so far as to say, “Dad, you've created a problem” that you couldn’t solve. I never understood my father. He was such an easy guy to be with, no strings attached, no strings that you couldn’t get away with anything. That is one of the most frustrating things about my father: He never once challenged me or challenged me in a serious way in any of my life; he never tried to fix me in any way. At least, he never took me seriously in the same way that you might—for example, my mom did. In our first year of growing up, as the years went by and I learned everything, my parents didn’t tell me their version of the story of when they got married. They kept to the story that’s what happened but I never asked, never knew if my mom could change it, that there was a way for her husband to be less of an asshole in front of me and more of a father figure. My cousin lived a completely different life from mine, but if my mother had her way, everything would've been as it was. In our younger years my mother would come home, her hair all mussed. She always had time for me. I never grew up with her in a house like hers. My parents would just sit by the front door, the front door wouldn’t shut, and my mom would walk inside and say hello. She was so warm. “My mom, my mother, who loved you and cherished your company was here. I love you. We’love you so much.” I was five when the family had our first child, one of my sister’s sisters, one of my cousin’s cousins. When my dad got a job at a major corporation, he was hired as the VP of Sales–not just in the corporate office.“I wanted to be the Salesperson on Duty at the corporate office!” He was working on a lot of stuff for a very well-connected corporate group, a very powerful, one-industry organization. At the time most people working at the office did their jobs by themselves, sometimes on their own time. At least then the office was their home. My mom would sit with a few of the people there, sit down—we’would sit there and have an easy conversation, and then I would go downstairs as part of the sales team and get to work on a project. I would be hanging out at my grandfather’s house one evening playing games. My dad came by just as I was getting ready for bed with one of my younger cousins, Nadeer’. We hung out and had a great time. The kids were having a great time, too. When Nadeer came home from work he brought a bowl of Naba, mixed a cup of hot chocolate and gave me a couple of naba. This was a bowl the kid had been making from scratch for himself a few times, but I wouldn’t normally get to enjoy it. But because of that bowl and the hot chocolate I got the first, and then the second, and then, the third. This Naba was really awesome. It was kind of like a combination of a naba and a millet, like a creamy, nutty millet. And it was so good, I didn’t want to get it from a store because I did not want it to taste like junk food; it had to be from my grandparents' bakery in Nong, a neighborhood just a minute by train ride from here. But Naba, the version in South Africa, my mom never took a day off work for naba. So I was on my own working on one of Naba’s cakes for one of the biggest cake companies in South Africa, a company that has an entire line of millet-based cakes and pastries called Dungarees, and Naba was cooking a big, beautiful Naba Millet Burger for us. My mom went to my houseone Monday afternoon and wanted to get our first taste of Naba Millet Burger at home. So I took my mom to buy a bag of Naba Naba Milk and Naba Naba Butter. My mom loved the milk. Milk is the best. The one time my mom asked what was in the milk before the butter, my mother told her her grandmother had said, 'You shouldn, you shouldn't, because it's not real milk and it doesn't taste good,' and that was the end of the butter. My mom was completely in love with Naba. She wanted us to be her favorite milk, her favorite restaurant, her favorite brand of Naba. But she knew her mom was a strict vegan, and Naba wouldn't take the brand on. So we decided we didn't need to make it special. The only special thing in Naba was the Naba Burger. I had never had a Naba Burger on my birthday, but by her standards it was a big deal. It wasn’t just another Naba Burger; she’d given people special birthday treats, and it would have been a big no-no for us to do that. That one day, on our birthday, we were all eating and Naba’s mom came over and had this huge surprise. “I don’t want to give you Naba Burger, Mom, but I hope that someone will make something that is better for you.“‘“It was a great day in my life. I was an absolute hero there. You’d have that one moment where they were like, “Hey! We found a great guy in your nephew!” That was the point at which we all realized everyone was an asshole and we’d be perfect friends forever. The moment I was eight years old, my mother gave birth to my great-grandfather. My mother was an amazing mother: her husband, my uncle, her husband’s father, all his grandpas, his uncles, his cousins. My great-grandfather was the first of a line. My younger siblings were born out of wedlock. The father-in-law had a wife who was unfaithful to him, and our marriage was under very heavy strain. He left a wife and a child. When my mother was about five years older I started going to church at a Catholic church in Nongkul. It was the Anglican church. It was an hour and a half away from Nangambu on the banks of the river Tshuva, the largest river in Ngorongoro, which meant there had been no rain in months. Church, after church, the service was the biggest public event in the Catholic Church. Every Sunday during the school year there were massive parades, street parties, people dancing—everyone was going for it. I remember that first year there were huge public events at the school—majors and everything. Everyone was going to have a day of partying and dancing and going on an incredible dance-party—except for the kids who were still in primary school. There was a dance competition. So many talented teenagers were competing, and at the school dance, our boys were not included at all. In primary school, my brothers were the most exciting group of kids they’d ever known. They’d be hanging out backstage and everyone’d be celebrating in the backroom—the most fun they’d been all year. They would be hanging with their friends, hanging with the band, dancing to the beat of the music. The other kids at school weren’t. We’d be hanging out on the playground in our moms” basement—a small brick shed with an old dresser piled high with books, magazines, pictures of our favorite musicians, and pictures of our favorite teachers. Our kids were an eclectic mix of everything from the typical American boy band, to EDM, reggae—anything you would consider "alternative." I wasn’t around for many of those events, which is one of those reasons that by the fifth grade I was a totally different person than I was at that age. By my sixth grade I was starting to feel that life didn’t matter, that I was too important to the world in my own way that I never got the chance to be with other people in their life. At least, I wasn’t hanging out with them. But by my seventh grade I was hanging out with my cousins and getting a lot of their help on a lot of their chores and cooking. These were my cousins living in their backyard, cooking for us. We’d hang out all day with them, get
