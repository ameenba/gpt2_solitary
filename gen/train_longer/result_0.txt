Then one morning she called and said Jesus came and took her son to the hospital. Jesus looked her in the eye, smiled, and said, “Don’t worry about what”blessing I can do for you.” Then, one morning after going to the hospital for the second time, the mother of all abortions happened. She was pregnant and the baby was out cold, so her baby sitter gave a quick, ­tongue-in-cheek way to say, “He loves you so much. But you must go home. He had the baby for a while, and now you need to get to work.” And just like that, the mother had a child. When Jesus came to visit our house, He brought me a Bible. I had already read it twice. I still have the first volume; I still had the second in my jacket. The second book, of course, was called The Son and the Holy Spirit (which means Jesus is my personal Jesus). The second book I never finished, because Jesus died young. He came to me and I never finished it after he died. So he came to me a Bible and an epistle to Jesus. The only difference was that on the first page in front of me was, Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Now I understood where the trouble was between us, when I went to bed one night in a foggy and empty house, a couple of weeks after Jesus died, Jesus was nowhere to be found. I was up late and not even really in the mood. Jesus came by and sat down next to me, and we started reading. Then Jesus came back and stopped reading. Then Jesus came back again and did nothing, but then there was He, Jesus. He was gone. “Why are you still reading Jesus? Get home.” “Because it’s better to come to sleep at night and die in the morning.” The mother of my two children was a real person. She was a real person too, and this one night we read all the books we’d just read, the stuff we were supposed to have read the whole semester, all the books we had read as kids, all the stuff that had really stuck in our craw all semester, the stuff that we kept asking Jesus about in school, the stuff we couldn’t understand, the stuff that we could barely wrap our heads around, Jesus never said a bad word. It was just that we knew it was always coming, always, and we just got hung up on it. “You’re going too fast. You should slow them down. Get the point with the passage.” I remember the mother of my son the way she is, just about the happiest she’d ever been. She was always the last to leave, and I mean just the last to leave. I remember the best moments, she was always there for me. Her last smile, when everyone was going to say a final farewell before she and I walked out to make a run for it, is a real highlight. But there were other moments that I always thought of as a dream and then I woke up every morning at 6 a.m., like a baby in a cold bathtub. The moments where I thought of God and Jesus and Jesus, they had always gotten very dark for me. I never dreamed God was coming to visit. But I was always the kind of kid that would be like, No, that’s a dream. It’s real! We have some other problems, okay? Then I would wake up the next morning and realize that I never really dreamed I was going to go to heaven, or even hell. It would never even cross my mind. But I never felt too bad about it, I never felt too bad about it for too many months. I took every hour of it for granted, so that would be like that. I didn’t think much of it. If there was a bad moment, it was a moment. When there was one, I was like, Oh.” When there was none, I would laugh about it. My mom was never one to hold a grudge. In her old life, a grudge was a relationship, an adversarial relationship where someone kept coming after you. When someone didn’t like you, they could make you do anything they wanted. So, my mother would always fight, either with me when she felt it or my dadwhen he needed something back from the people at Nippon. In my mother’s home, that was the law. My dad didn’t understand that. At the time my mom made me promise never to leave my dad. I had the best relationship with my mom because I’d met her when we were kids. She was more than just a family; she was more than a friend. She’d become just a friend. They’d always been like family. They were like father and son. I didn’t live my life with my dad on an even keel, so it never dawned on me that that would ever happen when I was a kid. When that day would come, I had a lot of pressure to take care of my mom. I was never comfortable as my dad—in fact, I hated being at home, especially not as the caretaker. So I worked to make sure she was never at my side in this life or even tomorrow’s, in which I wasn’t even that far behind. I was the youngest guy in the room and the oldest girl in the room, so every day, we’d wake up and spend time together. Sometimes I’d get to hang out with him in his office with the computer, occasionally, if he wasn’t around, I’d wander in with him and a ball. I’d meet up with my friends once a month to have a play date. I felt at home as long as my parents were around, but then as soon as they got married, there was no longer room for me to be with them, much less with my mom on my terms. I wasn’t a good kid. I grew up in the home I lived in, a household made up of single moms raising five kids in the time it took me to run around playing in sand traps in the backyard. And then my mom died, and then later this year, my mom died. My friends and I tried to pretend like it hadn’t happened, like it didn’t matter—but then my little sister came into my life in a flash, like a lightning flash of hope. Then one afternoon she woke me up crying in the middle of the night. I was up early to work and just going through the motions. But her voice caught my attention; it was as if she was saying, “Stop.” There was no reason for me to be in bed; this was over. “Stop,” she said. “How are you?” And this time I didn’t try to stop. This time I hit her. She didn’t respond. “Do you get it? Do you understand?” “No. No, please… I am sorry.” “Listen, baby. The reason you aren’t here for your dad’s birthday tonight is because he won’t come.” “I don’t know what to tell you. Is this the way I should make this important?” “No. No, this isn’t the way I should make this important. Dad, this is not how we should make this important.” I was completely in denial. I didn’t know what to do, so I stopped trying, and now I knew enough to know better. I stood there for a long time in shock. I knew that if I didn’t say something, she could do whatever she wanted. That moment when she turned the page, and the moment I finally realized that I couldn’t save my mom, that instant gave me the courage to stand up. I said what I needed to say. “Stop!” “I don’t understand,” I said. “Why don’t you stop?!” “But you are my sister. My mom is my mom. You’re going to live in my life? This is how we raise your whole family?” “Yes. No, no, no. I don’t understand.” “You have my sister. Now please, don’t hurt this baby.” I was devastated, and I knew that she’d kill me if she could. “Itokay,” Mom told me. “I won’t kill this baby.” She took my sister away from me, and that evening everything went back to normal, including the violence. Until then, that was the only thing that kept my family together, save that moment when we were driving home from school and my mom came right out of the car and said, “You have to go.” She wasn’t angry at all; she was simply telling me she loved me, and she didn’t want to see me hurt by anyone. “You have to go,” I said in my mind. “I understand. Your sister told me you would do anything to get me out of here, you know? It was a joke;” The joke didn’t come to pass, and there never was any kind of physical or psychological abuse. We had lived with this kind of thing our whole lives. I remember the time when my mom said that to me, and the realization that she thought it was funny because she was a terrible person. That was the turning point for me, and since then what I remember about the night was the worst of it, from that moment on. Even when I was a little boy my family was incredibly supportive. There were very few of us who actually had any kind of issues with authority figures. In the world, my mom never threatened or did anything to provoke me. “Go to sleep.” Dad said. “Take the stairs.” I complied, and that was the end of our relationship. BROWNIES “This is not good.” “This is not good!” It was an age when it felt like no one could get married without a family that supported them in every aspect of their lives—whether at home, school, the army, the police, or whatever else. Everyone loved to take a vacation when they wanted. We had kids of our own. That included my dad. Every time I saw him out enjoying the beach or on holiday he’d be there. But all of that, all by itself, would never make up for the fact that we didn’t have any children of our own. My mom was not in the workforce. When she worked as a housemaid for the government of a country, she had a full-time job doing housekeeping and laundry while she made sure the family was well fed and clothed. When she wasn’t in the house, my mom went to work in a bank. My father had been laid off from his father’s construction company, the J.M. Smucker Co., and he had recently left the bank. When that happened, my dad had taken over as the head of his own bank. I loved my mom. She was a very, very good and devoted mother with a big heart and a big heart of gold. She cared about people and did her best to help people. But, as a father, I knew exactly how I could use my position to my advantage. It was an honor when I found a partner who would take care of me, and then it was a thrill when I found a partner who took care of me. My dad went into the bank as a sort of independent contractor, meaning he had to start his own small business. It was a gamble: a new job wouldn’t pay that much and a bank job wouldn’t pay that much. But he went in thinking he could do this. He came out of working for the government as a business man. My mom had left the bank in order to be with her friends in the neighborhood, not as a full-time assistant but just living life to the fullest. That was the part of it that made me so angry. My mom had taken on a job in the city where she thought she was above it all; I’d never been more unhappy with anyone. So my mom went in knowing full well what she was getting into. And she went inwith the right tools, and it worked. The thing about our family is that we did some very wild thing to get by. We rode mules—one of our parents had a real horse, a mule from the local mill. Our mother’s mother ran the mill. Our father worked in a factory. My mother worked at a bank. In fact, it was like my mom worked for the whole economy. She was making sure the economy worked. She’d take my mother outside to ride wild mules, and then we would go for hours driving around the city and talking to the mules and riding the mules. There wasn’t anything like it. She would give us a break; she’d give us a break all the time. Like, you could take a break because you’re not hungry on the road. But we did, because we didn’t need to go anywhere, because we made the most of the time we had in the city—and I love this because when I get older, there’s no way that I’m ever going to have a real family. This, by the way, was a big one. Growing up with people whom I know very poorly, I knew what going to jail would be like. My first five years in jail, I spent five nights on my cell wall in an ice-cold sweat, every night, for no reason. I remember crying in the back, and my mom, with that same big smile and that same sweet smile that people used to come over to hug me—I told her this story from then on. It was like I was having the greatest nightmare of my life: sitting in my cell with no sleep, having no food, having no water, watching people get locked up and put in isolation, for hours at a time. It was terrifying. But as scary as it was, it didn’t matter where the nightmare had taken place. It was all over so fast that it didn’t matter. I went from there. And as I grew up, I learned that the longer you spend in that prison, the less likely you are to make it out alive. I was lucky enough to know two guys who did. One, who would always look after me, even as I was in the back of solitary. He was a really gentle and funny kid. The other one was a violent one, who couldn’t take a joke. So as a 13-year-old I wasn’t afraid to have fun whenever I could—to make me a joke—and to laugh even when I had no idea what was going on. If you were in there for too long, then it would wear you down. The most difficult thing about working in prison was the boredom. One of the things I loved to do was watch movies and read books with other kids. I was very smart as a kid, with a mind that wasn’t restricted. But the books and the movies always had me in the middle of a scene of one group versus another. I could sit there and not even know what was going on because I’d just sit there. It was all the same to me. Every single book I can remember was set in the present day, right on time or shortly after, and I enjoyed it. You learn about things in this book and then you learn about them in the next book. Books gave me an opportunity to sit through everything I thought might've happened in the moment, and then I could learn from the book, too. I was lucky, because in the time I’d spent in the prison system, there were no schoolbooks to help me. I could study in the library, so I was exposed to all this information from a very young age. But books were the worst. To my knowledge, I was the only one of our four kids who never read a book. I read a bunch of newspapers, read comic books, read books about animals, and a few magazines. But I didn’t read books. I was always reading books. Even if it was just for a few pages or even an hour. At home, I was so absorbed with a book that I didn’t do anything for an hour. It wasn’t like the prison. In the city, it was like the mall. You buy things and you enjoy them all the time. In the prison system, if you buy something and you don’t have an hour to enjoy it, you sit through a half-hour that doesn’t change much from where it started. You buy abottle of wine, sit through a half-dozen people sitting around a table, and the end result is that you buy six people a bottle of wine for the day. A quarter-glass of wine is not that big a deal. But the same thing is happening with video games. Every four hours I walk into my friend’s house, he’s buying one of their games. It’s not something you buy for a kid, like, 'Hey, why don’t you play some Tetris.' You buy a game for your grown-up. I’d always wanted to play Rock Band. It’s kind of like, you know, I want to sing the World A’s Song. Then a million times I don’t get to sing it. When I’d first started in computer science, I was playing an arcade game called Space Invaders. I had no idea what I was playing—I didn’t have a PlayStation. My mom made me get one of those old-timey game consoles to play. That came with the power cable to the TV. We had a giant, big Nintendo Entertainment System. If you wanted to play that game, it had just one button: Up, Up, Down. “Up!” “Up!” I used that for two things when I was younger: It made me want to go through a list of every single thing Nintendo did in those early days, but also to play through those levels so we could watch them play. The controller would turn red when there was no input. If it didn’t turn red, my cousin couldn’t touch it. If I could never get the controller to turn red, then I could always touch it and it would react normally in a different way. For example, I could play like I had a Power Ranger suit, and then a Power Ranger suit would turn red. At least that was what it sounded like. If you knew what that meant, you knew what an arcade game was. In the real world I was always playing Street Fighter, I was Super Pac-Man, I was the King of Fighters—anything that required an arcade setup. I would sit at my desk and play a half-hour and come home, sit back and watch it through the power of the PlayStation, plug in my TV, turn on my PS1, put my controllers on, turn the PS1 on, and I’d go to sleep. The next day there was my PS1 running on my TV like crazy, waking me in the middle or the middle of the night to play something different that morning. If someone gave you an idea to make money, where would you be? You would be in a strip club. It’d be a three-piece band: Guitar player, bass player—no song lyrics. Singer. Dancer. Then every other day you just sat on the couch watching the show. If that day worked out for you, well, you knew it worked for other people like it did for you. I would have hours to play, play until I had time to get up, go do something I hated, watch all the cutaways from the show, get ready for the next song, and then turn the PS1 on, plug the console in, play my favorite game, and I was done. “It has to end right? You need to find your escape plan? Let’s go, and I’ll kill everyone.” “We know how fast the music picks up. We know when to go down or rise. This song is set? You gotta change it to something new.” You can play fast and die young. But it wasn’t fun. I would sleep the entire time on my PC. It gave me a good rest in between gaming sessions. Sometimes at certain times I would turn on my PS1 to play Destiny and I wouldn’t notice that for several minutes. The thing about playing PC games on PC is I can just play PC games on PlayStation 3 for hours, days, weeks. The only question was when to stop?““’Oh. Well, I didn’t know that.” I don’t like the way the Internet works. But at least I could just play PC games on PlayStation 3, or on PS2, on PC, on Game Boy, and then come home and play a game or two. And since PS3 and PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Pro all worked and had all sorts of things, there would be one place I knew where I could get everything and go back and forth. And because the Internet provided everything but the house, I would have a constant connection. Every time I needed help I was on my own and I could use it.

PlayStation 3 offered PS2 and PS1. All I needed to do was hook up some extra cables into a dongle, and I got everything. And it worked! I could play virtually anything on PS3. The only issue was I could not run all that crap on PS2 and PS1 in my bedroom, either—which meant I also couldn’t play those games outside in my living room. So when I needed the money for a new laptop, I could at least play on my living room, then I could get it over with when I needed it. Which was why I had these games. Games where you were a detective solving a murder mystery, playing through a game of Werewolf. That was my main source of income and the most fun. And there were a ton of games for a lot of different kinds of people. So I spent an insane amount of time making sure I could go wherever and go wherever I wanted. To stay on top of everything, I had to keep running all over the gaming landscape, trying new things, playing different kinds of games, and trying out new platforms. There were so many options to use. The game I loved the most back then was Dead Space, and it ran just fine on an old PC on a new monitor, but it didn’t work at all on the old monitor. The monitor didn’t handle the pixels correctly. The picture looked terrible. I had a terrible time using it. There were no games back then that could play back on a TV I could sit in front of. The sound was terrible as well. You couldn’t hear anything coming down the screen. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Sony gave away all sorts of weird peripherals to keep me gaming all year long. You could play PlayStation on a PlayStation, a Game Boy Advance on a Game Boy Advance, PS Move on a PlayStation, Game Boy Color on a GBA…. I got my own TV for a long time. I could sit at home on the couch and look at the big screen, and I could sit at home on the TV because every now and then, the TV would go black or freeze or freeze and freeze and freeze. This was always after I’d hit a point where I just didn’t do any of what I was doing. Sometimes I’d start playing, and then every thirty seconds it would turn off. Sometimes it would turn on again, but then it would never go back off. I would play for hours at a time, not stopping to look at the display. The PlayStation 3 The PS3 was a bit of a breath of fresh air. I didn’t have the problem with the display freezing or turning black, really. But as a general rule of thumb, if you get a game that doesn’t work for a few hours, change your monitor. The PS3 had great sound. The sound was fantastic. It would pick up the sound of some other game I was playing. I could tell which sound was coming from what because it always sounded different—and my ear wasn’t that good. The sound was perfect from my couch, perfect—even. The PS3 was so big and powerful. The first day I hooked it up I got the speakers up. I plugged them right in and sat right in front of the TV while the game was playing. Sound came right out on screen without skipping a beat. In my mind, it just played right along. It was super-fun And the graphics on the screen were amazing. The graphics at first were horrible, but at some point I’d noticed the graphics at work in other games: In The Last of Us, for example. When you look at the screen of a game—the first day, the first moments, every moment—I saw that I wasn’t getting the graphics,or the soundtrack, or the voice acting. I wasn’t getting to play with the characters. I was missing out on the adventure. That was where it went, but it also showed me how this was what we were living. I hated every moment of that game. I cried at the screen one night, and I cried so hard for the rest of the day, I lost count and was on edge. There was no music playing. There was no score in my head, nor did I find the option available. There wasn’t any context for the music. There was no voice acting. There wasn’t any story. There was no way to tell the story, and I hated that. It was depressing. I thought that game was terrible. I thought it was awful. It really was. It took me until two or so in the morning to come down from where I was crying, and I told the whole family to get up and get the girls to the dance. They said, “Nope. Not for your little girl.” Which was the best response I’d ever gotten. It was so perfect, and I remember going, “What the hell man? It’s a great idea, but we don’t want our little girl to watch?” This was where I was at that point, too. I’d grown to like video games. My mom still thought they were disgusting and violent. But these games that were released to me? That made perfect sense. I grew up in an age of violent video games: Mortal Kombat on the Sega Genesis, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Street Fighter III. That was back then. I remember thinking then, “I really like video games.” But now when I play them, I’m like “Well, that didn’t work out so well, either.” “So, how’d this work out?” “Pretty well, man.” “How?” “Well, when Tony Stark invented Iron Man, he put Tony in the ring, and at the last second Tony hit the button, and Iron Man did what I’m told to do.” “What do you mean?” ”He’s gonna have Tony fight him, man. The other guy has to stop him, and he’s gotta go get Iron Man, so he’s the guy who has to come out and kill Tony.” “You are wrong.” “I don’t like what you’re saying about Tony.” “Not at all, man, not at all. We know what you’re saying about Tony. Don’t ever let this happen to us. Tony will take you out, man, Tony will take the other guy out.” “You’re not listening. This is just a lesson. It won’t work out. Let go of Tony and watch how this works out. Don’t touch him.” The thing about video games as a product of childhood, as opposed to the product of our digital lives—that's the thing I hated about them. I thought they were horrible things to buy when it came out. They felt like a slap in the face. In The Witcher 3, I played a character called Ciri, the white sorceress. In The Last of Us I played a character called Joel. They had a strange relationship that went somewhere between a father being stern and a son being sweet. I was a big girl growing up. I played video games, so I was the only girl in a room. My mom was a total masochist. I remember every time I got home from school, we’d play Mortal Kombat together. It was such a bonding experience to play with my mom. When I walked into her room, I would play Mortal Kombat with her. When I got home, we would play together. It was almost like we got along the whole time. It was a blast. We’d play games together. We’d play fighting games together. We loved it. My mom had other things going on. During lunch we’d go to McDonald’s. My Mom hated McDonald’, but I always thought it was a wonderful way to escape from school and schoolwork, so in high school when I walked inI would be like, “Okay “that’s where my friends hang out.” “You don’t get a real hamburger here, exactly.” “Why don’t you give the kids here a Burger King or something? It’s a whole lot better.” “Oh, but McDonald’s! It’s in the middle of the middle of everything!” “Really? Like everyone’s eating here all the time?” “Yeah, actually. That’s right, because no one’s anywhere. McDonald’’s is the only place open when you need it. “Everyone’s in the restaurants,” I’d say. “Why is that?” “Oh, just because everyone’s in here all the time!” “Right. But what do you mean? Don’t you have a McDonald’’’. You have a McDonald’’s.” “Well, we don’t run a big McDonald’’’ chain like McDonald’’’“s. We just do what “McDonald’’s’ does. We’ve come to you for a meal.” “That sounds better,” I thought. “You’re right. That sounds awesome.” “Wait, no, the whole deal!” “Yes, it sounds that way. If you want a real hamburger, you can have a real McDonald’’’ restaurant where it’s cooked on‑site, and then it’s up and out on your house in minutes. I mean, that’s why McDonald’s.” I remember this lunch being a struggle more times that I’d remember it, because now I was more in the moment. I knew that if I ate at McDonald’s, or one of the other burger chains that I liked, there wouldn’t be that choice about whether or not I could have McDonald’s or not. That’s what I knew, and that made my decision to eat at a chains like McDonald’s that much easier. My mom was always a perfectionist. And I can understand why. For most people, their mother says, “This will never happen to you; this is too bad for you. Please just relax a minute.” In my family, this is why we don’t have children. We have four parents who give us unconditional support, and that gives us a lot to deal with. But for me, my mom was never that kind of mother. She was never trying to get me to do things — which, considering the life she’d chosen, I think she did an excellent job of it. The only reason why so many parents I know have children who have difficult lives is because the parents don’t let their children be children. My mom was never trying to be my mother. If she asked, I told her no. She wasn’t trying to be my mother. She was my mother in person. She was always there to pick me up in the mornings, to drive me there, to talk to me on the phone. She was always there to help me get up out of bed, whether I wanted to or not. But on the plane, we would be separated by a wall. She wouldn’t let me have my photo with me. The photo was only there for her to take, of course, but the reason the photo was there was because her photo was there. After school, my mother and I would hang out at home on the front deck. We’d sit on the grass. Her car sat outside my mother’s house. “Hey,” she’d call out. “Hey,” and she’d pull my books and other old papers out of my bag and put them on the grass.” Or else my mom’s hand would be there and she’d grab me and I would sit and read to her. I loved that dynamic. Every morning at school, I would walk over to myroom and be like, “Here, I have some time on my hands. I’m going to write some poems.” Then I came home from school. There were a few friends I knew that were in touch with me, like my friend “The Kid?” And they were always giving me advice. “Write something to read.” And every morning, I would sit and go through my letters and see what my friends were saying. I had friends in a similar setting that I could turn to for advice, at the other end of that friend-system. There was the black neighborhood of Mpumalanga, where my friend was from. When we hung out on the street corner, he said, “If there’s no police to help me, what else am I going to do?” It felt safe. If the police came, we wouldn’d laugh and go back to our own business. So every single Monday I would just sit outside my house crying. I just sat here. At least, that’s the way I remember it. That was my mom coming home from college. And every single day before we went to school it was me crying from the pain—and crying because I knew she could help me to the end. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — I knew this wasn’t how relationships were supposed to go. When I grew up in South Africa, I remember my mom saying the thing that gave us our first family back then: “It’s time to go shopping.” “Oh, come on, honey. Let’s go!” ­ We’d get to the store and get our clothes, and when I got to the till the saleswoman would point to the nearest girl and say, “Here you are. Look at her. You’re a real girl today. See?” If we looked at her, we thought she was hot, because she was hot. If we stared in her eyes we thought she looked cool. You were a real girl if you tried hard enough. One morning it was my birthday. At my house I was three years old, so I didn’t even want to go to school in time for my birthday anymore. My mom said, “It’s OK. You can be a little late but you have another little sister, so go to school.” At home it was like we always were—one day there was my sister coming into the yard, and my mom got mad and grabbed her and stomped her to death with her shoelaces. Everyone else got out of the house. I remember crying the whole time. At that moment all of my fears about the school day were replaced with one day of a girl named . It started out pretty great, I just went running. But as I ran, I couldn’t see what the problem was, not until I was almost outside my house, when two or three men caught up and started hollering at me like they were angry white guys, and then they started attacking me like I wasn’t there. I started running back inside. My family was so small at home and in school that we had one door per family for each person. So after about five minutes I heard a knock. Mom opened the door. There was no one outside. There was my little sister, sitting on my parents’ lap. She was sitting on their shoulders. “It’s here. This is where is from. What do you need?” “We need to go to school.” I stood there dumbfoundedThat first year in the park was definitely the best first year in my life.It was great growing up in this environment. It was the first school I knew where everybody knew everyone. It was the first time I'd ever walked and spoken with other kids. “This place is fucking amazing,” I said. “Why don’t you try it out?” “Because it’s not real.” “No! You’re completely correct: This is just for show.” “It’s not real? You know what I mean?” “Yea, but it isn’s real. It can go away and have fun, but we’d just be back there, the same fucking kids.” “Look.” I looked in his eyes. “Please. Please. Please stop.” A mother, I know that sounds crazy. But this is what happens in life: You get that one moment you really know what this person is doing—and you don’t want to show them or anyone the way it is. Then, the next minute it turns out that you had the heart for him. You become like his family, your family, the village, your town. After a time, the other person turns out to be an even better person than you were. For the life of me, I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that when it came to growing up in the park I had to stay in the house. The first year, the entire neighborhood ran amok in celebration, everyone was partying and having a great time. I had my mom, my aunt, my uncles. Everyone was hanging out, playing games together, and the whole thing was a blast. “We’m going to the park.” “No. We’re going to the backyard, or our backyard.” “But that’s the front yard!” “It’s not the front yard. The back yard is the backyard. It is where everyone grows their food, and the dogs in one corner and the cats in another. It’s where they play. People come from all over the neighborhood to see what’s happening, so it’s why it’s called a backyard. It doesn’t matter where you’re from. In my mind, in my brain, my brain, the whole time I couldn’t leave here and go away. To be honest, I could've done with another year and a year and a day of not living in the house, living with my mom, taking a year or two and taking a year and a day of the kids playing, sitting in the living room and playing for hours on end. Maybe I could've waited a fraction of a second to get to the bottom of all this chaos and then walked out the door. After a week or so, the excitement in the kid’s eyes waned and he dropped to one knee in front of me and put his hand on the end of my shawl. He took it and put it under his chin, and he started kissing me, gently. I could feel the tears in his eyes. My heart was shattered. I tried to keep my mouth shut. “Sorry,” I said. "We had fun. We’re going back to our houses now.” “No. No. No.” “No?” “Look” he said. “Look at you.” That’s when the real hard stuff happened. The next day, I ran off and made my way back home. My cousin, my best friends, their parents were at work. I ran back home. My mom was in the kitchen. “Look. Is it any good? I need to see my friends.” My mom walked over and I jumped on my mom’s lap and crawled over to kiss her on the forehead. Then she put me under. “Trevor, take care of me.” “Oh! What happened?!” I jumped up and ran around the dining room to the kitchen. This is going to sound lame, but it turned out that when we wereat lunch we’d sit on the couch and watch TV for hours. I always felt like my mom loved me and I loved her. “Mom!” She said. “What are you doing?” “Are you watching TV? What, are you watching TV? I just have to read it!” At that point my mom gave it a shot. Then she said the one line I love to hear, “Do not go anywhere!” This is something she tells me when I go down a dark alley, when there’s an open door for the thief or the bad guy, to say, “Don’t ever let this happen to me.” This statement was a big warning, because by that point I was used to hearing it in my day in court. “This will not happen. Don’t do this.” But that line didn’t stop her. Sometimes it was a way to tell me the person who was committing the crime wanted the situation to turn violent so she could get back at them, like a knife, my mom would explain. “He wants you to die!” When she spoke like that to someone I was a kid, that made the whole thing seem like an easy joke—for one moment. But the thing that made that laugh so infectious was that it made all the things she said look like they were true. There was nothing innocent about the people she thought would get hurt because she was out watching television! All she did was bring it home that she thought something was funny. For that reason, it feels so surreal when somebody says that to you. It sounds like there’s no consequences. There are no consequences. Just me being you, me being me, me feeling me. I never did get to hear that line. In court it seemed more like a threat than a comment. And, of course, there was always the line about the knife— “Trevor, be careful. We won’t have a knife here for the rest of our lives.” “Don’t get a cut on you!” “Trevor would never cut anybody because it would hurt them, and she wouldn’t want to know why someone tried. If something was bothering us, it was because we were too stupid to know better.” I could see her reasoning clearly; I used to be a kid too. If you got beaten up by a member of your own community, then no, you shouldn’t cut your arm off and stick it somewhere in the dirt for all the world to see. There’s always the chance something might happen to you. If something did happen, then get help, you idiot. It didn’t stop her sometimes from getting very pointed with us. But for the most part, I never thought of cutting anyone for anything other than a joke. I could see how easy it made me look foolish, how ridiculous it made her look. I could never understand why she did it. All I could do was sit there and stare at her and laugh it away. I was never going to cut anybody just to look funny. In court I couldn’t even imagine doing that, because the person was guilty, and there was no other way around it. In our relationship she never came up with a rationale. She was the one deciding every action’s consequences. She decided. I never understood that. It didn’t feel true for me, and she never told me. I didn’t know any stories people told me where they used knives as a way of making a point. The last words my mom taught me, the final words I learned from her, was, “Be good to each other. You see, life goes on. You don’t think about a situation but you have to deal with it. You don’t have a problem.” “Now go do something.” The truth comes out. The truth came out to say no. So we got along well, and we never got into any serious trouble. “Don’t do this.” “Yeah, I don’t think so.” “Yeah, I'm sure my mom would be very offended!” I hated hearing my mom berate me about it, which is why you’re seeing more of it todayI was a kid who couldn’t stand any form of discipline. When I had the opportunity to do what most boys did during recess, I did it: I took to the playground. I took advantage of the chaos, the mayhem and the fun that surrounded me. And then I killed it. It was almost two thousand pounds of meat that had been hung in a plastic bag from the ceiling by my mom’s car, but I could barely walk away. No discipline worked. No restraint. No boundaries. No control. Not today. “What am I going to do?” She asked. “I’m going to kill you. That’s the way it will be.” At home, I was a typical girl. Our mother was a homemaker with a house full of kids, and when we moved, she found a new home in another town. After some time she and I got along, and we fell in love and made a new family. We went to different middle schools, but we stayed friends for life. Then one day our mother went away and went to go make the purchase of a new house in another part of town. We were left home alone. When we found out she was moving to another part of town, we knew that her next door neighbor was going to be the devil. Her mother had left the house, and since she didn’t have us, she was moving out of the house to live some distance from us. The old people from her house were all getting together to celebrate the end of the year, which meant that there was going to be a major New Year's Eve celebration at their place. We had the best time ever. We watched the revelers beat the s**t out of each other until the whole family finally fell down the hill, and we danced in a circle after the party and everyone had a merry-go-round and everyone drank and got into their finest clothes and danced and had a great time until all the old people came back up to the house, the people who lived on the other side of the road and who didn’t celebrate this year except by killing each other. It was like a movie out of Hell. The only difference now was that the old woman had a gun. It was like the movie set had been shot through. We danced in one long line at a time in front of everyone’s living room, and we danced until dawn. Then we danced for some reason or another, and everyone left for the dance party in the morning. Then it was on. I remember the days when she had a huge hunting knife and I’d have to use my parents for an implement. Then there was the time at home when she got us a pair of scissors out of the junk drawer in the kitchen — scissors, you couldn’t tell they were there, because the handles were all torn off. It was the scissors I used all the time during school to shave my mother, and I never felt guilty if I accidentally cut my hand. But now it was the end of the road. “No, no,” she said. “Don’t be like us.” “Make yourself a weapon.” For years, she would pull the trigger on the knife and tell us not to use them, and my parents would look at me like, "That’s just a mother saying things.” There was a reason for these conversations, an explanation that I’d kept secret from them. It was partly because it was so difficult and partly because my mom was a perfectionist. If the idea of me holding hands made you think I was the perfect man or woman, you didn’t listen. “Do you still want your wife to have sex with other guys?” I’d say. “No,” you said. “Well, I can’t make you have sex with other guys, then.” “Oh. I don’t think you understand. I don’t think you understand,‘ my mother would say. “You’re saying this to your daughter so that she will keep being you.” I knew when she said that that the knife and scissors weren’t for me. For the most part, it was me telling them that forthem to have any real value to me at all, I had to show them respect. I didn’t understand what that meant, except that it wasn’t like I was getting a new set of toys for my daughter. These are toys she has grown up with from day one, and I would be getting new ones from somebody else if I didn’t give her a new set of toys. At home, I wasn’t doing much. My mother still slept in the house at night with my dad, and we always talked about the news on the radio all night long. We were a very close-knit family. The only times I missed my mom was the occasional visit home to sleep with my dad at my mom’s house. On those days we talked about what had happened and why, and about the children she had with other men. This was when we talked openly about the abuse and what needed to be done about it. So, that year, I did all the work I could. I went shopping and grabbed the toys my mom and my father provided me with, as my father helped me keep track of the items my mom bought me. I took the new ones from the store and packed them away for me in my mom’s room to make up later. My mom made the calls, and in a year I knew what was going to happen and the reasons for it. I knew where the money was going to come from. I knew the people responsible for it were the same people who were responsible for the abuse in the past. The problem was, I didn’t know what I was getting myself into, because my mom wasn’t the only adult in our family that made me feel like this for almost a decade. — A few weeks later, after my mom had a couple more kids, she got me my first real assignment on Earth. It was a new, untitled assignment for the Army to send an African-American soldier to Africa. This Black soldier was going to be the first nonwhite person we had on our side against the black majority who were trying to take over and take everything. I don’t remember much about that assignment. I don’t remember anything except for this one time my mother and the black woman who was with her were in tears because this black soldier was their future president of the USA. The last thing we wanted was for the people around us to look back on us and say, “What a bunch of rascals. The poor people of Africa weren’t nice to you?” On a whim, I decided to go and help the white people of Africa build this new continent to take over. I went up to the nearest village with my little group of people and found a couple of white kids, two cousins of mine and a couple of older brothers. Everyone was sitting around a little round table. Everyone was talking and laughing. There was one big group of us. One of us was my mother. The other was my cousins. The younger one was our leader. We were going to build this white continent to take over the black black. That’s our mission. “We’re here to conquer this black Africa and be the masters of the black continent!” “No, no.” “We’re not gonna conquer.” “No, we’re not.” My mother didn’t really understand at the time what the big deal was being the masters of the black continent. After a while she started realizing that when black people came together and did some very bad things, the other black people would come together and do some good things. I mean, the black continent was already under white rule, so this was no big deal in the grand scheme of things. In truth, she’d made her point. If white people were like people, then black people were kind of like people — kind of. Black people were not people at all. They were kind of, like, other human beings. And that made us all just kind of people. But as long as my mother was there, her friends could be friends with people, too, so there wasn’t really anything awkward about the relationship I was having with her. After a while, I kind of understood. When we came to an agreement, she took it and went back to listening. “I don’t give a fuck,” she said. “The thing with black people.”My mother, of course, was in a different place than I was. I grew up in an upper-class white suburb. There weren’t any kids of my own. If anything, the kids I knew of were more like cousins—grandmum, uncle, aunt, and so on. Then one evening, she came to my room and told me to go get her. “Oh, my God. Your mother is here,” I said. “I’m at her house.” “Why should I bother? You can stay here. She’ll be home in a minute.” But she was not leaving the house when I came home, so naturally my mom had another idea. “It’s time you left.” “I don’t want my son to go to this. I don’t want all this trouble.” “Well, yeah, if you want to talk about it to me, because I’m not your dad anymore,” I said. “My uncle wants all of you to be here, and there is nowhere for you in my family that you’re not accepted. So when he goes to my house, I’ll be at his house. When he takes you out to his house, I will be at your dad’s house. So if you don’t want your kids in my house, then you won’t be in my house.” “Why me, then? Why not go home with my dad and go and get your kids from their school? Go back and get your kids from school.” “Yes, . . . . — From there, my mom moved from my backyard to my mother’s house, and for the next fifteen years, we lived a segregated life. When he was in town, my mom was at work, cooking. When my mom was not working, she was home with my two sisters, who had one of their own private rooms at home. After a year, my mom decided she needed out of my house. “You can go home with [your kids], or you can stay here and not see [your kids] anymore, or whatever, but only the kids who agree with us. If it comes down to that, you can leave because I don’t care.” She moved in next door, where we still had a back fence and a gate. I was too young to notice this and it didn’t change my views of the segregationist system. My mom wasn’t getting along with him, at least I never felt like she was or that she ever wanted to be. But at that age, she was a woman of principle. I never felt at a disadvantage in any way from my birth or her childhood. My childhood came at a terrible point, too. My family had migrated to South Africa, an island nation with a beautiful, rich agricultural past that I’d rather avoid than explore. It was at this point that, despite living in a white suburb of Cape Town, I began feeling like I knew no other place on Earth where I’d feel any real cultural isolation. I lived and worked just outside of my house all the time, on a road that ran straight through the middle of South Africa’s industrial cities and over into a pristine blue-green wilderness at the top of the world, just like Cape Town. At the very top, it was one of those white enclaves that was basically like a small village where everyone lived. At the bottom, the only human traffic was car trips in the dirt, and even there, there was nothing but grass and dirt. I loved this freedom so much that I went out every morning and did whatever the hell I wanted. I’d be in the backyard with my little brother, and then I’d be climbing up a couple of the tree trunks that were still around and going into the backyard and up to my backyard, and I’d be going play around and fighting all day. For any given reason, I just found a time in the day to get outside, and no matterhow many times I would walk out my house, the thought of running over to people’s houses just made me want to jump out and do what we did. I had run to the park at least ten times because it was safe. I had jumped a fence and run onto the grass. I wanted to be that person you see on television walking around that backyard after hours, running around chasing down squirrels, when your mom was home, but you never saw them again. I could walk right in the hole, and everyone around me would just see me and walk away. That was the point. We would play together—and then, one day I thought I just might try this thing I’d only wished I had for myself. Then one day I came home feeling good. I had a good run and now, I had to start getting a new run. I didn’t have my own runs or anything. I played through all my friends in a family. Dad ran the water company; my uncle bought my mom the boat; my stepfather ran our first surf shop; my brother ran our second water company, and my father ran the second one. My grandparents owned our first four-wheel-drive business. My uncles owned half a dozen others, all of them run-down and in shambles with no cash except on Sundays. Dad and I worked in the fields. On some days, we would wake up and do work for our friends before we went to sleep. Otherwise, we started driving. There was no curfew or a job posting to remember. We would come home from work and look out over our friends at their houses, and we would say, “Good morning,” and we’d walk around for the rest of the day. That’s what we did. My grandma would get up on Sunday mornings and we’d watch movies. We had four or five old black & white films lying around in the house, each in one of the backrooms, and we would sit there with our popcorn ready, and we didn’t have to think about a problem. Then I’d come home from work and Mom would open the door for us and we would all go inside, get ready to enjoy some family time with the grand kids and the granddaughters. Then our parents’s whole day would begin. Afterward, she would tell us about the movie we wanted to watch. We’d go outside and see what had been announced, and I’d watch, and I’d laugh and I’d cry and I’d have a good time. This was when our family was one big happy party. It was Sunday morning, and it was our last day of seminary. I was in high school and in a state of shock that was the last day I’d have the Sunday school class before I had to leave. There was no lunch service—just us and a bunch of the friends from school hanging out in the yard. I had been in this little box, sitting in the dirt for the past ten years, so when my mom called to say that the seminary would end at lunch time, I jumped off the table. She called the whole class together. “Hi, everyone! This is my mom and dad. I'm going to drop them off at school.” “No, it’s not, dear. It’s okay,” was my sister “s voice saying, “We’re doing just fine. We can’t drop them off yet.” “Well, okay,” said my mom. “I don’t trust you all, so take this message to the principal to get everyone together for an orderly lunch,” and she and the rest of us laughed. I went back to my seat, and I cried at the scene. It was the worst day in my life, and it’s the worst thing in the news right now.” “No, no, it’s not the worst thing in the news in the world. It’s the weirdest thing in the news right now. You are all crazy.” After a few moments there was some lightbulb moment for everyone, and everyone burst out laughing—I was in full cry mode by the time it was over. My little sister looked around and said, “We are not crazy for laughinglike that! Why are we laughing?” Well, I had been told that laugh came from laughter at the same moments. “Well look, my friends, why aren’t they laughing harder?” “My friends have been laughing all over the place! If we’d only stopped laughing when they were laughing, I would have gotten a heart attack!” My parents thought I was hysterical: “We don’t think of laughing like that! You should stop laughing!” I told them we were laughing at all the times we laugh, in the moments we don’t laugh. Then I laughed all the fun that was coming our way. That afternoon I ran into my friend, Kaitlyn, at a party in South African Zürich. As we sat in the crowd, laughing our asses off, I heard this girl—Kaitlyn, not my real name, but she was a popular girl in Züri, a white suburb on Zulu land that was roughly an hour and a half's drive from Soweto— “What’s up?” I asked. “Why’weren’t those people laughing at the end of the movie when the guy was being nice to the princess?” “Oh, you mean at the end of the movie,” she answered. “That’s how it was supposed to happen. When someone was angry they were supposed to laugh. When someone was happy they’d become friends.” “Wait, there were more than one person laughing at the end? That’s crazy! There was more like three-quarters of the audience laughing? You couldn’t make this stuff up!” “Yes, it was. My grandmother was crazy. She would yell at you in a loud, boisterous voice, saying, “You are a moron for laughing too soon!” “My family laughs when they know a joke well enough, my friends. You need to grow up!” I told her the story. “You know something? They laughed so hard, it made everything worse for the audience. It was like they hit the ceiling and were still standing! It was really funny!” That afternoon my family and my friends and I stood behind my mom, sobbing my heart out for half an hour, laughing maniacally. The whole thing was truly a spectacle. For a couple of weeks, it was our annual escape from the house. Our car was always in the garage. Once a year we drove my mother to and from school. “You remember why he is good? It was his heart.” “That’s so funny. It was all because he was sweet. A lot of people I know are sweet. My friends, mostly. My grandmother doesn’t like it. That would be too painful for her.” When my mom told her this, Kaitlyn said, “No. He is the one who is sweet.” “You cannot be sweet? It’s wrong when you talk bad about other people! How dare you call me that!” “Because he was sweet?!?! The girl! She was our best friend?!” I understood now why my mother hated him, and I understood why he loved her. We both felt the hatred. We saw it in our faces. Even after my mother had me baptized our family remained very protective of me. He told his family to forgive me, which was never an easy sell. They did forgive me, at least. Kaitlyn, they got me a better job. “If you will forgive me,” they said, “I will bring you the greatest pleasure.” My mother was ecstatic. This was like the best day of her life. I loved the moment so very much. She said, “Don’t be upset with him. Let him suffer!” It was as if we were in a wedding reception. My mom was saying, “Please, this is how it is to love. This is how it was. We love each other. We're going to make him laugh.” “Please, please! This can’t get any worse than how bad thelast thing was!” It didn’t seem possible to me to just leave. I’d done it. I’d told him I would kill myself, and even if I did, he had the strength to stay with me no matter the consequences. I couldn’t go. “Hey,” my mother said. “You’re right. We can’t be alone anymore.” “I hate your father because he hates me, because he's the worst motherfucker since the day he walked through that door. He’s an angry person. He’s a fucking psychopath. So don’t come into our home.” “I can tell you what, “I am giving you two weeks to forget.” I couldn’t tell my mother why at the time, but I know now that it was about the only option I had. She was right. “Why?!” One day she was crying in my car; another day she was crying in the house because she hated her dad, too. “My father is such a monster! He’s so mean to me! He’s such—” she said. “Please,” I pleaded. “Don’t kill yourself so he can have sex with you! This is not right.” As I kept crying and pleading she got even angrier. “You have to be with him at all times, or you will suffer in your father’s company. Why don’t you go and be your real father’s lover every single day? You will never forgive yourself.” “No!” I cried, desperate for an escape. "Why do I have to be so careful? Why will the people around me have a sense of shame about me, or I’ll just get in my fleece and live a life of torment?” I begged her. “There is no need for you to go and do the opposite. We are going to live by the same rules as our mother. And the rules that were set are exactly the rules that will make your life easy. Don’t worry about it. Be happy, and you will always have the best life. Your mother told us the same. You’ll have to live up to the same standards as your father. That’s what we taught you in the church. Do as your Mother taught you in the house.” “Please, please!” she begged. “Please! This isn’t right! If we cannot live up to the rules, please be quiet. Please be with our Father. God is on our side! He makes our decisions and we just follow His will!” It ended at a point where I was certain that one of the only choices I had for myself was to do exactly as my mother had: I could kill myself. My mind was still reeling. There never once did I think I had a choice. I knew the only thing that saved me was my mother. She had the fortitude and the ability to pull out the most basic of personal security cards, such as: “Father’s protection will not be used against me. You and I are not in a relationship. He does not know what he’s doing. This is your life. No matter what happens, you need to take care of both yourself and the child.” The third week of Christmas, I didn’t see my mom again for a year. That was the worst year of my life. My mom, who I had fallen in love with by the end of sixth grade, had left me to find her own path. I found my mom with a friend a lot of the time. We would drive through the woods and parks of central England. And my mom always took us to local restaurant where I’d get my food, and we’d stop for just a cup of tea and chat. The restaurant we’d go back and forth between would be somewhere in Harlow. Then our fellow villagers” in the nearby countryside would go down to the lake and spend some time on the sand. There was no electricity. So I hadto walk out one morning and stand on a tree. Then I would have to walk back back and stand somewhere. I had no idea where, in that moment, I was supposed to do any of that. And no, I wasn’t ever going to get any training in that. I was like a zombie. What did my mother teach me? I was never going to be like my grandmother, who never got any physical education in school. What happened next was one of those things that happened so quick that I don’t remember all its details. It was a summer in the early 1990s, a summer I was going nowhere. For the first time in my life I was on a budget. My mom gave me a computer and the power to do what I wanted. My first job was to take video of my grandparent’s house to teach them to use. I was an amateur; the kids just called me M. A. A friend of mine, a guy called Tony, lived around the corner. One night I woke up his cousin who was at work. We were the last people in the house, and the cousin came home early to play with his kids. The kids all looked at Tony as if they were going to kill him, but for some reason his little cousin didn’t think like that. Tony wasn’t that nice. I walked my cousin over and he handed me my phone. This was the first time in my life I ever thought in terms of money. I wasn’t trying to save up to buy my first car. That was never the plan. I wasn’t going to invest the money into something that I was always going to need in the future. But that phone had been giving me an amazing insight into how this other dude could be far more successful than any of us in our day-to-day lives. If only I had a camera. That day I was out on my own, working from 10pm to 5am on a Monday. I’d forgotten everything, I wasn’t taking any video from this distant place, not even the occasional selfie. That afternoon I walked up the street and peered over the fence to see what was going on. All of a sudden the fence came down, exposing grassy land. I’d never seen grass like that in my life. The ground looked like the grass in South Africa. I grabbed the phone, but it wasn’t working. It was an instant memory the minute it happened: I was like, Oh, my God, that’s the grassy thing outside my grandmother’s house now. “What is going here?” you asked. “No, what?” “Why did she build a fence outside it?” I started. I knew nothing about what a fence was at all. It didn’t even seem plausible to me. I don’t remember ever telling my grandparent exactly what was inside it. “Oh, my G‑‑‑‑d, this is the house. You want to live inside this house?” I was so taken aback by the sudden realization of something that I was not supposed to know that I didn’t bother asking my grandma what she did. She came to me and was like, “Shall I tell you this story?” That was our one chance to learn anything. I picked it up, read the story. After reading the story, my grandma decided it was her duty to tell it. She told all. But one thing my dad kept telling me was that my life was my adventure, mine to do as I pleased. That’s what life was all about: You go with the flow. Take some risks. And, when you take those risks, you reap the rewards. In South Africa you couldn’t be a rock star. I didn’t get to be a DJ at clubs or whatever else for that matter. My parents would ask me when I was ready to break into the music scene as often as possible. I would say, “I don’t know. It’s been a while.” I was always the kid at the table making decisions, so when I told them I couldn’t be a DJ my parents just went with the story and were like, What does the kid know about that?” It was the kind of conversationthat gets you both to work and make the decision,” “because it makes me feel like I am in control” In the end, the most amazing thing about that situation was not making them regret it, but taking an immediate and forceful stand so they would know to change. I had the best friends of everyone in this house of horrors, and none of them would take the hint. They knew the drill. They were in it, they knew the drill. No question, I was their No. 1 DJ for a month. So then my mom and my stepfather had the worst idea to keep us waiting: “If we can just get you out of here. We need to get out of here.” I knew from the start that if the other kids were going through the same thing I had, the worst thing I was ever going to do was take a stand for me. When I told everyone at school who I was, the only people who laughed were my parents. “No, no, no. The best thing you can do is get out of here,” they grumbled, because their family is so much easier to deal with than mine. They did not want to live a story, either. “Go back home and take some time for yourself,” they said. “You don’t understand. We live in Los Nombres.” “We do?’ “No. We live in Soweto. You know what happens in real, American, public places? You get shot. You die. Your house burns down. What about the outside? You get murdered—like a real-life murder? Who cares?” “No, no, no," someone told them. I felt like my mom had a choice, but she chose to not make the choice. I took an immediate, decisive, powerful, life-saving risk. I made a stand. My parents saw what I did, and they immediately called their neighbors up. “The Nuts! Get away from the Nuts!” “What!? Don’t tell us you said that?!” “I said I called the Police!” “No, we didn’t hear you.” “No, no, no,” I went on. I was yelling that she needed to calm down and let me into her living room instead of having this horrible car wreck in the middle of the night. “What?! Why are you even fighting?! I don’t understand!” I was so enraged I couldn’t look her in the eye. I wanted her to get out of here right before I left with my mom, and I was so mad I could have hurt the worst part of her life. Then as we came home from work I went back to my computer and looked at those friends. They were laughing. “I knew it,” they laughed. My mom wasn’t one of them. I know she was laughing as well. She wasn’t joking. She knew it was real. We laughed. “That was very disturbing, because it was a really stupid thing to do.” We all laughed. It took me a while, because I was trying to be professional and polite, but then I realized. “Your mother did the most stupid thing on this planet,” I said, “but you shouldn’t even think about it.” “No, no! Don’t tell us you said that!” The joke was on me. The joke was on my friends as well. They’d all laugh at the exact opposite of how serious I was being, because I knew that this joke, if he was serious, was what the joke was about. Finally, finally, after everything I had gone through, I was angry enough. “Get the f*** out of here!” I shouted, as if we were kids back home. “This is over,” they said, as if I were making some serious threat. “Stop acting like a faggot! We know you are a faggot and we will get a judge to see to this, but if we can’t get you out of here we can do the rest of the chores because we can’t handle this“What you mean, how did you get into my home?” A man and a woman, two young kids, were sleeping in the crib of the other man. The father woke up, checked on his kids, and then left with them without saying a word. The mother and the baby walked out of their room into the living room. My mother jumped out and tackled the mother. “Whoa! Whoaa!" I said, shocked. “What is happening!?” she said. “My husband has a gun!” “No, no, he can’t do this. They can’t die. It’s against the law if the man goes around and shoots someone!” My mom jumped out and grabbed him by the shirt. I was scared. I was terrified of this happening, because what if he wasn’t taking my side? What if he did something so horrific, so unthinkable, that it could kill the children? “Shit! Why?!” I screamed as my mom wrestled him around the room. He didn’t say a thing. The mom ran in and hit him to the ground, holding him up with both hands, her mouth agape. It was unbelievable. At the same time it was sickening. “I won’t hurt you!” she said. “You have the children! I’m so sorry, and I will let you live. But don’t kill my child.” My mom took another look at him. Then she let him go limp for a moment—like he was still conscious. Then she slammed him to the ground. Then she stood and took the man down. The other man fell out of the sky. Blood dripped down from his neck and a bright red streak down his side. He was completely gone as I watched. The baby had gotten her attention. “How do you guys feel about that?” she said as she ran her fingers over her husband. “Trevor, I wouldn’t be here if you didn’t say yes.” “You don’t know me! You don’t know what’s going on with me!” “We haven’t decided whether we love or hate you yet, Mr. Turner. I do think we owe you an explanation.” “What happened?” “The man shot our baby. It killed us. If we tell anyone. He should be punished. I don’t like it. You do too,” my mom said. “But I’d like to know the truth. How did you find us? We know there is something wrong with us. Let’s keep the kids in this house because we love our kids, Mr. Turner.” “I don’t like it either,” my mom said. �My little sister went with him to the park and she found our dead little boy and we wanted to leave. I had no choice. They must have been in the park together for several days, since we saw him so much. I know this is not right. Please, please, please protect the family,” we begged. Please go away from the park right now, please, please.” “Please, please, please.” “I can’t. My heart is broken. Let’s run.” As they ran from the house, I kept the thought in my mind about the children, my family. “I know he killed them,” my mother begged. “We know he did this. I’m so sorry. Please, help us! Help us get away from here now and we will never harm anybody again!” I knew right away what it was going to be like when they left the house and what it was going to be like when they were gone. But all I wanted to do now was cry and cry to see my beloved baby again. I cried as hard as I could. Even when my parents were not on-camera the tears they would shed on live television, I could never see them get to me like I do on the reality show,where they just let me down, and I kept thinking "this is never happening here". I didn’t like that; I didn’t like the pressure. I hated that. But what else is there? It was an especially long season in my life when I finally went to school in a black neighborhood without parents or siblings, so I was living a life where the whole thing felt real to me for the first time. It was a good time for the most part. Then it felt like it didn’t even feel like I was here at all. In my time in the black suburbs, I never felt like I had any direction but up. I was one of those kids with no education, no career, no goals. You have a few things, maybe. A car, maybe. But life was going the other way, and I’d spend much of it being that kid in a black household making a living and living a life. The most meaningful thing from my time in apartheid was that eventually my life, which was about to become my legacy, came to an end. A white man bought my house, a house that had stood outside my backyard, surrounded by trees, for years. I moved to a white enclave on the other side of town while my life in my childhood was about to happen. As the white suburbia burned, white people came and built white enclaves in the black ghettos. White people built white enclaves in the black suburbs. Apartheid brought about a certain change in life for me. For one thing, we had no cars. We could’t afford one. We could ride our bikes but not drive; we could walk but not run; we were the lazy, unshod suburban family. In contrast, blacks are all about the road: The streets are paved with our blood. For the most part, white neighborhoods were more like small towns than larger cities. Our houses were small houses built to last. Our streets were paved, our sidewalks paved. There was one narrow, winding stretch of road through the suburbs, but as we got older and our car costs increased, we decided not to go down there because the roads were long and there were so many angry black people. And we didn’t care. When apartheid began, white women were still subject to the man-beacon codes; men could not ride a motorcycle without a helmet, even on the weekends. There was no woman’s right to run for president as a man, either. A man had to stay at home as a man. There were no women’s movement. Women’s empowerment was for men’s liberation. Men’s struggle for male gender equality had been a long struggle. Men’s efforts to empower women had been a long struggle. The government’s goal in the end was only to protect men’s sexual interests. Men could ride motorcycles in the streets, but women had to use the roads as men’s sexual space. Men’s roads, women’s sex spaces. We weren’t allowed to do anything on the roads except walk or sit and watch. The streets were now our backyard. By then, many people in my neighborhood were either living in shacks or living in shanties. There was little electricity, no running water. In my neighborhood, our shanties ran off our backyards. The streets were dirty enough that we had to keep the shanties in. On one wall was a windowless box with what appeared to be the word “GUNMEN” written in black on the ground. In black paint was a picture of some big, heavily tattooed muscle man in some uniform. On the other wall was the words “I’m a man now.” My mom was the only woman in the household; she was the sole breadwinner, and she was a stay-at-home mom. It was no big deal that I couldn’t use the electric or the phone in my backyard while my mother did all the housework. That would have been like if you married without a man’s support system. I was still going through that one night in the black suburbs when my mom decided I had a life of my own and let me roam my backyard on my bike. I didn’t understand the power of her decision at the time, but I knew at least one woman in their world knew better and didn’t try to take advantage of my situation. One night during apartheid I was ridingmy bike through a town called Eindhoven, when I felt an odd sensation. It was like someone pressing against me from behind. But instead of coming from behind, the sensation felt directly to my right. I don’t know why. I wasn’t hurt at all; my sense of balance and speed would have been restored, but for the feeling to come behind me and directly against me. If the guy pressed me, it would have hurt right away. But this happened before me. I was fifteen, and my bike was broken. And I don’t even remember the first time I had a broken bike—or if I ever had a broken bike—the day I felt that weird feeling. It didn’t go away. It just got worse. After another day of riding through the town, at this point the sensation was so bad that there was a police checkpoint set up in front of the town police station. It was a series of wooden concrete dividers, which was sort of a cross between an electric fence and metal bars. It was a complete nightmare. I was thrown over these wooden boards and shacked-up against the wall, a constant reminder of how small my life was. I was chained with a chainsaw to a bench in my town. A man sat in my town. A woman worked from the kitchen, and everyone else lived in my shack, or at least had a job working from the kitchen for me. I couldn’t see or even touch my mom, who was chained to the wall from the outside, or my aunt, who was chained to the wall from the inside, and could only see the outside world through a wooden barrier. I was in that hellhole all day. When I was eleven, my mom bought an old TV—the Panasonic—and hooked it up to the wall. The signal, when it came in, was perfect: I had all the programs and channel stuff I missed on cable. The TV was perfect for my whole family, and my two older brothers used it on a daily basis. To get through a day without the TV, I’d sit at home, in my PJs, watching old TV. Once upon a time, my TV wasn’t set up in the back of our house, but it had an old-fashioned set-top box, and we got that at least once every year, usually the summer vacation after we’d lost an election or two. It wasn’t very exciting, but it gave us something to do during the holidays, and I remember playing a huge role in all of those, having my TV set up in the back of the house while my Mom and siblings made the short roundtrip across Johannesburg to the township and back in time to watch the fireworks. The thing I loved most about my Mom is that at age ten, all you had was you two, your room, and your friends. I don’t remember when we moved to a town square, but that was the house we always lived in. So our street was my mom’s. We lived next to Johannesburg’s old school, which was what we called the University. It was a small, one-room school that just kept on growing as it went through its growth spurt. It had a swimming pool, indoor tennis courts, a soccer pitch, and a track. That’s when my younger brother and I were the best racers they saw. Once each weekend I’d walk up and play outside, and then I would head back inside and watch the old school sports teams get ready for the next weekend. It was a wonderful way to spend my afternoons. In the days before our roof was torn down, we lived in a shack on the corner of Mainline Road and Mjungishetwa Street; I was seven or eight years older than my cousin. It was a four-room flat. The room was a small, windowless, shaggy log, and my mom and my aunt, my sister, and my brother were in the kitchen with us. We had a big mattress lined up in the middle, and a large bed—just enough for me to lie down on because we couldn’t move around, but it was enough space for our bed, our food, and our toys. The only electricity in our house was from the wall and our family's home power—the local power grid, the one where you plug in. We only used that whenever we needed it. Every time we’d come outside, my mom would run our little electric-toothbrush charger, then getmy sisters and me to play—and we were all a bunch of weirdo little mutants as far as running is concerned. For the first few times we used to go into our sister’s house in Parma, that house in the village that my sister had always owned. We went upstairs to my mom’s bedroom, which was the room behind the bed where we hung out from the night before: the main house. We still lived here when we were younger, but my mother gave my sister that tiny shack as a refuge, where we could get comfortable, and we lived like most teenage girls in the village. It was a tiny little room, barely more than five square feet. But I never saw my mother play with any of the games in the house. She never played with anything. The only time my mother played outside in the garden was to play games—she liked to do puzzles that way. But I knew this was her, an adult woman, and I never saw her playing with any video games. I remember when we moved into that house, all the technology at our disposal. We had all the game systems that you could buy at the local computer store. We had a modem on all the other walls. We had cable and a cable connection into the internet. My mom used to have a computer that ran Windows 95 at a time, but she’d rather run Windows 95 over the top of Windows 95. That would keep it up and running 24/7. My mom played games as well, but that was because the only way these games were fun for her was if she was in control. If I was playing, and I was trying to save as fast as possible, then I wasn’t playing because I wasn’t in a game mode. I had always felt that my time on Microsoft's console platforms was a bonus: The games I played were great for me. It was nice for me to be on a team. I got to play against guys from around the world as if my existence were a team sport, and I got to play alongside them like a real team—that feeling of competition and camaraderie that you get from having someone on your team. But my mom, for her money, I never got that. She used her time and her dollars wisely, but she never really spent it on anything except for family. We moved with her into a modest home on the outskirts of town. Then some kids from the street got there first and set up shop right next door. The next thing I knew I’d been living in that house on and off for the past twelve years. This one was a shack. That one was a shed. That one was the second floor. That one was our basement. There’s a reason my mom got me locked away in her shanty. The house had power in, so this shack had electricity. It couldn’t be turned on or turned off, just plugged in. The only other person in my life who was close to me—people I cared about, other people in my life, were the only people I interacted with and shared my home with in a positive way. The only people who had any interaction with me were those people. That’s how close I was to my mom to the point where I was like, “Let’s just survive this life. So we can spend our time outside.” My mom had a very protective and closed relationship with everyone, from her two stepmothers (whom we had only rarely seen on the outside of the household during our time together on the Xbox) to her stepfather. This was all controlled, controlled, controlled. That was my secret. And from all that isolation, she made sure to protect everyone from a single and ultimate outside power, that was the internet. It had been in her house for years, and there was always electricity, so no one could break into her home. In reality, my isolation was one big reason she never really broke out of her shell and moved out into the real world. When she was growing up, she always believed that people needed their time and privacy—that they just need to be themselves, so they can do the things that make them happy. But as more years went by she discovered that not everyone is a saint. Everyone does their own little arc of selfishness and anger and suffering, but they all happen to be on a collision course and must pull apart to find out who won the big battle. Every now and then the internet would come along, a chance opportunity that the family would take. I don’teven need to do this. In every other context, we were both just fighting, arguing with other people to keep what was ours going for a little while longer. But with the internet, no one has to do it. The only rule is, “Never talk to the internet again,” says Kasey. “I am not going to play anymore. No internet. No no no no!” “Oh, okay. “Are we in the same boat?” says Kasee. “What?” “Yeah, you're not in the same boat.” “Oh. I meant it that way, but we can play a little bit together, too. And let’s play some games together. And, um…I mean, it’s only here for one day.” Kasee was a kid I idolized as a kid. He was so cool. I wanted to meet him. I wanted to be him as a kid. “Let’s have an adventure, kid!” The first time that happened, we fought the way we fought. Kasey came running out of the house, and he had a knife. He held it out to me in the street. “Trevor, this is this.” “This is what we used to call a rock.” And I took it and I began to fight back. The moment my hands touched it, I was like, I don’t hate you. At that point my anger and my hatred and my rage and my frustration was so huge I thought I could get the world to just chill and not fight any more. I could let the fighting go and we could go back to just getting along. “What do you mean by that?” he asked.” I told him. “What do you mean, “I’m not in? You got me into? You know how it ends?” “Trevor, I’m not in, kid.” Then he cut my arm off. I was shocked and angry at my mother about it all the time, but she didn’t seem to mind at the time—until that moment. Then it became all about fighting me. When I met my mother in the late 1960’s, like most other middle-class black women here in the South, she was living a double life: she was in and out of rehab, living on the streets with other junkies, on and on again on and on. She wasn’t working; the only reason people paid her for the rest of their days was so she could keep going through the day drinking. It was during the time my wife and I were moving into our house in rural Virginia that I realized that if I went back into rehab and was caught in the middle of a fight I’d have no one there to stop me, because my mother would get me in the middle of it and my life as a young man would just go on as if nothing had ever happened. So even though she had two different, but connected worlds, I found myself thinking, “Mom, I never realized how much you wanted to be with the hustles.” She came to realize the same dilemma in her later years. The first time that happened a couple years later was in 2003, when we moved to Northampton, an extremely wealthy, upmarket suburb that had the greatest white flight the country has ever seen. This place was the same mix of suburbia and exurban living you’ve got in Hollywood. My mother and my stepfather had bought a $30 million home in Bedford Avenue, in Charlestown at the tail end of town. They kept it, the two of them, in what might have been the world’s coolest penthouse overlooking the swimming pool, which was great. My stepfather, who was one of the biggest movie stars of his generation, worked out of a beautiful penthouse with a private bathroom and a huge kitchen set up in the back. My mother stayed in a two-room house with a tiny garage in the backyard—and for years we lived there in the backyard, watching our friends move out of the city to have homes that were farther down the road. We moved out there in the backyard all the time, taking the kids out for walks. Northampton had one of South Africa’s first green fields, anarea where you could farm in abundance. It was amazing growing up. I loved it. I was lucky because I met a black farmer. We’d been friends for like a dozen years. He was great to work with, but he always had an edge when he was pissed off. And sometimes in our life, that edge gets to our family. He was a good guy, but he was also a man full of shit. His temper was out of control. He hit back hard. Sometimes my mom had to help him calm him down. One afternoon my mother decided to help him. We left him and my dad at home, and I ran. I ran to her office, pulled down my sweater, ripped my jeans off, and had a good laugh. "Hey, where the fuck am I?" “I was at Northampton. I was doing the errands. You should come up and see what I’m up to.'” “Okay, cool.” ‘I had an idea: Let me take these shitty jeans, strap them on, and show you how to grow. I’m going to go down and see these farmers in a ditch, and see how many of them were born in this area.” It was an amazing idea. But then I was six years old. A friend from college introduced me to the farm of our ancestors. My mom used to run an antique and fine-art store in Gauteng, and a friend, a black man named Rado, worked for her at the shop. Rado was such a down-to-earth, down-to-earth, kind of guy. As our family moved out of Gauteng to Johannesburg, Rado was always the guy we were staying with. I would run into him all the time. We all grew up as close as we could to home. Every weekend for the past couple years, Rado worked in our place, cooking for our family, or cleaning our rooms. Whenever he got his lunch done, Rado made sure to give it to the family. When he didn’t do it, we always took food home for ourselves in our basements. My mom loved to cook, and I loved to cook. Growing up together, cooking was a necessity: We worked as a team, and that meant cooking all the time. This was not my time. My mom was in her mid-thirties by the time we moved out, so we were both retired. As for Rado, even as we were moving out and moving in, he was never going out in public. Rado lived on his farm, where he grew a beautiful garden, and I lived in the basement, where I would live a life of crime and violence. My mother loved Rado, too, for a reason: Not because he was cute, but because he was tough. He never backed down from a fight. He was one of the few men in my life who didn’t give a fuck—at least not what he thought about it. Rado was strict, but he was not. He was a strict disciplinarian. If someone kicked your dog, you had to beat the shit out of the dog just to make sure that it stayed on a path to get out of there. If a person was breaking your car window, the only way that you could protect yourself was to hit on someone else. It was a zero-tolerance system. After a fight, Rado’s guys would sit in the backyard, and he would take us over there and beat the shit out of us. At our house we had the best food in the world—a family heirloom marinated in lemons that we used to have when we first moved out to a new homestead a few years back. Nowadays it’s just a pile of plastic and wood. But the old-fashioned way he would feed us was to throw me a bone and ask me how I was today. He’d beat me with it, and that was it. My mother loved having that opportunity. She loved knowing that I had one. She couldn’t give it to me—she had to beat me with it. In my home, you could kill a man with a mere glance, but the moment you walked through my door I knew you were for real.It was around that same time that I first came across the Bible, the story of Jacob, the boy God sent to the land of Egypt, which also happened to be where I was then living when I became Muslim. After being in New York a number of years I came across a book on the subject of reincarnation, The Life and Times of Jesus Christ, and I decided that my only other option in life was to get out and be like Jesus, who had to beat the crap out of people for their trouble, to be with them for the most part just as Jesus had been with God all along. Because of that, I started doing my own stunts. I used to do the same thing to other people. In my old day-care class, I used to make a point of having people cry when I did stuff like that. It was always to scare the crap out of them. It was to keep them from doing anything stupid. Like crying when you were a toddler. To make them go away in a daze, like crying when they were three. The cry was the most effective means you could get the person to stop doing something, and the crying made them forget all about you for a while. That, in and of itself, was the whole point of the experience. It kept them from getting hurt and made you forget the pain. The best way to scare a five-year-old is to beat him a thousand times. As time went on, the things I discovered that made me more human made it more rewarding. One time at a park I was playing, I pulled out my machete and proceeded to carve a piece out of stone with my teeth. It was the best experience I had during all my time doing a machete. It hurt like hell; once, to this day I still hold that scar in a constant state of discomfort through my head ever ever. I still have the scar all the time, and sometimes I get angry and frustrated and tear it up. But even before that moment it hit me: I got to stand on the other side of history when it came to the machete. Now that is what human beings become, not monsters. I was a super child then. Now I'm a very happy, healthy, well-rounded man who has never had any of those issues to deal with. In retrospect, the trauma and stress of being a Muslim in the early to middle stages of being in the Christian world were really some of the hardest things I've ever had to go through in my life. I was not religious before. Being raised in an American family, my mom raised us all to be. She made me sit up and keep my hands in my lap while my family took the kids to school, and when the kids were finished we went to school. So even before coming to America she was perfectly at home with the rest of us, with us kids, and with Muslim kids all the time. My mom, being a very observant woman, never went out of the house with her family to a religious service. If there was a big feast at the house that month it was my mom doing what Christians do—getting the whole family together and doing her own special thing. I remember the day my mom finally decided to go to church every Sunday, it was Thanksgiving morning and all they had in the house was a turkey. It was my mom's favourite meal before Thanksgiving. We loved it. It was always the same old, standard turkey, the stuffing, the stuffing and more mashed potatoes. We used to bring it home the whole week and take a break from it all to eat and rest up. So that was how we always went to mass every Thanksgiving. That was the end of turkey. That was it. Then once an hour my mom would step to the side and let everything go. She would do that for like an hour, but the moment her presence went, it all kicked back into gear. I could hear her laughing when I could. She was such a super friendly person, but now she was laughing so deeply. At first I was like, I'm going to just sit right here and enjoy it. Then eventually we got in our cars and drove over there and had the food and the stuffing and the stuffing and the Thanksgiving-morning moment for the whole family. Now that it was my mom doing my thing and all it was going to be for were myself and our kids, I understood my parents as a whole had just thrown aside their entire lives and were going to step back with a little blessing in the form of an hour of peace. I didn't expect that, but it happened. Wewere all so happy, like everybody did. I thought the day would be a long while before they felt like it. It went a long time before they felt that, too. We all walked into church, and all of a sudden we were standing out there right at the end of the assembly. [laughter] There we were. My mom was at Christmastime. The last thing I thought about was, Oh, shit, is the whole thing gonna end today. What now? I was praying for the whole assembly. All through the Mass she was just standing there, praying that God would forgive our sins today? No? Oh, okay, maybe I should try that. [laughter] [laughter] I felt a complete revelation. No, not a momentary revelation. I had an awakening. I had just read the Bible to my own family for the first time today, and all of a sudden I realized how many times Jesus Christ has taught and reiterated these fundamental values to people at their core. I never had a moment of panic the way I did at Pentecost when I found myself praying for an hour, five minutes, thirty seconds, and I finally had the feeling that I knew when God was about to strike. [ “God, please forgive us for the breach we have made on the wall of Jesus Christ. Let us give Him thanks for breaking a covenant made with him.”) I sat back and waited. “This is so funny,” she said. “We've never talked about this before. I mean, really,” I started laughing. Afterward I called my mom and told her. “My god. Did you see what I just saw?” She looked at me dumbfounded. “No,” she said, “We've always known Jesus as the greatest of all-time. That was our religion. This is the second-worst. What do you mean this is the second-worst?” “Look,” I told her. “I don’t understand it.” “Why are we going at it like this? We’re in church. Jesus just called them in and asked them to do something together.” I was completely confused. “Why are we talking about Jesus? Jesus calls people. Christ calls people.” I couldn’t say anything. I stood there frozen as if I was speechless. I didn’t know what to say. “What do you mean, we’re talking?!” ”Well,” she said, “he’s calling people to act in the kind of way he wants us to act.” She looked incredulous. “What do you say? I don’t understand. God, please explain these things to me,” “What do you mean?” “It sounds like a joke,” she said. “This guy’s really mean to us, doesn’t care we stop making the sign and praying and acting like Christians.” “No,” I said. “I mean, we do want to stop making the sign, so that’s why we’re not performing the miracle we were supposed to be.” “What?” she asked. “What’s the miracle we were supposed to be?” “Well, you see,” she said, “Jesus is angry.” I knew from the moment I first read that one Bible verse that everyone who has ever walked down the aisle at church was an apostate. I didn’t come up with anything new there. — I was so confused for so many moments that night that we ended up coming up with the most ridiculous prayer I could come up with. All night long, every time Jesus came into the Mass, he would say themost ridiculous prayer I could possibly come up with. “He will have power on the day of judgment! He will be there when I call in. “ He will have power! I kept asking Jesus every time for a moment of grace, and he kept bringing me back to the same prayer, always from now until then. Jesus wanted me to feel that we were on the same team. As the weeks dragged by, my mom would come home from Mass, and my life would be changed forever. When she would come back from the priest's office, I'd start praying the same prayer, and that would continue every day. She'd even come home from work and I'd start praying the same prayer and she was always going back to the same prayer, going to Mass, and doing the same prayer. I remember one Sunday afternoon, at mass, I got into the pew without Jesus. That would've been the whole point of being with him, I realized. When we went to Mass, he would come right after that. “I don’t see what’s going on with this today,” he said. “No, don’t tell me,” I said. “It’s Jesus at Mass. Jesus at Mass. I can’t explain what’s going on! Please come and say something!” Finally that’s my mom, calm. “I really don’t understand everything.” “Well, listen, baby. You don’t feel it. We’re all just having fun. Look, Jesus will give you that moment. Jesus’s coming out for your day. Jesus’s going to be right behind Jesus here all week. And we have Jesus right behind Jesus here all weekend long.” “What?” “You want Jesus at Mass?” “What?” “If Jesus says something, I―ll see that in the newspaper. You don’t tell us what’s going on. When I ask Jesus to come down to the pew and bless us he doesn’t bother doing anything. He’s like, “Can you pray to Jesus, my son?” “Okay. Then come and pray to Jesus right here.” The next time Sunday came around, I went back to the old version of Jesus, this version that still brought me sleepless nights. At last in the year 2010 I went to Church, and for the first time in a long time I felt truly welcomed. I was sitting at the home of the pastor, and I heard him ask the congregation if they could join him in the altar. The altar, as he called it, was where the priests and ministers met at the temple after performing the religious function they’d scheduled in the community for that day. As soon as I stepped outside, the whole mass paused. The sound of the people gathered in that space echoed all the way down into the cemetery down by the road that my grandparents had taken to live with their father, an Orthodox Jewish guy named Michael, a rabbi. I remember it being, like, quiet except for the sound of people going to and from the temple. “How do we know you guys don’t want anything to do with us now?” Michael asked. He was going to tell me all about all the wonderful things we were giving away, like all our free kettles, and the amazing food we were taking out of the kitchen. “So, what about all the kettles?” “No, no, no, please don’t answer that! It’s not good. They’re full of kethoys!” No, no, Michael said, they couldn’t be, all the kettles, I had to be sure. “If you think you’re going to change the future of the nation, that’s no business of yours whatsoever. Please, do not interfere.” “We can, can we? We can?” “Of course, but not that way.” “We can, but not that way?” “No, please, please, please don’t interrupt! Please! Please, please, please?Please don’t”t interrupt! Don’t interrupt, okay, okay, okay!” The kids were being a little rude, but he knew better. We told them exactly what we would like for our dinner, just in case it got interrupted. It was one of those situations where it did come out in the news, but because everyone was in my kitchen, I was the only one in a lot of those scenes, and I can make a few of those. One night I was having an argument with one of my sons, he got frustrated, “Man, they didn’t stop for nothing. Why don’t they make us some pasta?” “I said, “What do you mean they’nt?” I’d said something along those lines a thousand times. The response back seemed to me like I had just asked him something that should have been polite, but the way the kids were going was a little too much. “It would be wonderful if they’d stop for a second. Would you like something?” “No, I want something.” I remember this kid's face when I was angry: I’d seen this face in his life. It was the face he’d seen the world through, the face of fear. As a child, he was used to being bullied, of being bullied at school, of being bullied in his neighborhood. He would not change. He did not need to in life. His parents encouraged it all the time. “I love my son. Don’t do that to him.” He did grow up with me through all the years we’d had a bad relationship, with our parents' inability to forgive. Because of the things that happened to our families in our lives, one of the first things he learned was that there was always a way to get at anybody in the world. When he was five years old, he left home and went to live with his grandfather, the great general, who was a general in the Japanese army. He was five years his senior, an equal opportunity general, so his entire focus was on my family. I think he saw how precious my children were. They looked up to my kids. He had an endless supply of them. Every day he called us to see if I wanted to come to his home to stay for a few days. He was very protective even as a kid, too. I know him not to have ever been into sexual abuse or neglect. He would never have been exposed to it, because he never grew up with them. He didn’t look at them as a barrier to his world. He only saw them as a shield. “Trevor, there’s no danger there. You haven’t been abused. You haven’t been neglected.” When his daughter died in a car accident, he took the boy to live with him in the military. So we were living at the same level as his parents, and it was a big step up from our normal lives as family. As a child, there was no stepfather figure in my life, no father figure who took care of me, who taught me. My father had his job. My mother took care of her kids. “I take care of everyone here.” The war in Iraq was over. The war was over, and I’d been promised a big family after the war was over. I started having panic attacks and chest pains at night, when I thought someone was watching me because I would not leave. One day my aunt came home very upset and concerned, and I asked her for an explanation. “Mom, why won’t they say, “What happened?”” Trevor, the youngest, was like any other kid. We’d been together forever. This was our childhood, right here in the house now. I said, “What happened?” “We lost our home in the war.” “How can you say that? I was in the hospital when they were bombing the hospital.” “Did you see that happen?” No offense, mom. “No offense, T. You can ask the war.” “But T, you have a younger brother. What do you know about the war?” Mom laughed. “We didn’t really have one kid to worry about the war,T told me. “There wasn’t a problem until the war.” We were so far removed from any military activities that in the back of my mind I knew that if my younger brother had anything to do with it, he’d get caught for a crime. The only way my mom would forgive me if I was a terrorist was if I gave her the proof that my brother had been involved with a terrorist. But I never did. “Why not let me have my fun while it lasts,” she told me. “I will stop if you don’t stop killing us!” That’s the only answer, right there, that I understood, but it was not the first time I had given her such an off-the-wall answer. At least, not the ones that she had given before. “You know what will happen to my brother if you keep doing this.” “No, Mom! Please, please, please stop it.” I didn’t blame my mom for not believing me. I didn’t think she deserved an explanation other than what the cop had said. But from this point onward my mother was the one in charge, the ultimate authority. My mom wouldn’t get on TV talking to us. “Please, please stop this.” In the summer of '91, there were just enough black on white crime in the South to create some black on white fear, but even the crime in the South was so much worse than you remember, with white people beating black people to death with sticks and stones and clubs and hammers. All it took to spark a racial crisis on television—what you had in the South—was a white cop running around beating people to death with wooden sticks and hitting a man with a machete. There was never the slightest hint of tension from my parents on TV. As long as we sat in our living room with an overabundance of crack and beer, we knew all the time to shut up and go watch the movie. I was my grandfather, too, and that film wasn’t even allowed on my brother’s birthday at Christmas, which was probably not a coincidence given the fact that that’s what we did most of the time. I was the only white kid in my younger years—and because the movie didn’t go over well with the white kids, I was the only child in our house—that I’d see it all the time. The black people were just in the background, and the white people were just in the foreground. At least until the movie started showing us the truth. At any rate, after the big white cop ran around getting beat up for no reason, I was completely cut off. I didn’t know why. In 1992—three years after the rise of Al Qaeda—the most lethal terrorist threat to South Africa would have been a lone gunman who couldn’t even bring himself to blow himself up anymore. It was during this time period that Toto and I started planning out our ultimate move from South Africa to the United States: going on the Internet. I was a huge nerd during those days, the best-connected person in our class at school, so when Toto took off to live with his uncle in Washington D.C. for five years while we went off to college, my brain immediately thought of all the fun things we could do online. I was a complete geek, too, the kind of brain that could multitask and think like a computer. I was so good at computer games—the popular games included StarCraft, Warcraft III, Tetris. It took me a while before I realized that I was so good at games that even at the point when Toto left home for Washington, he was never home when there was nothing but computer games to do. I remember one evening as we were both at home reading together, a dark-skinned girl came over to see what we were playing. My mind was on Tetris; Toto was the black cat; that was his favorite. But I realized that there were other, more fun, black games online, in black stores, that we’d both played together on those computers. Toto was the smartest cat in the room. I was the most dumb cat, which I was never gonna learn. Toto was a black man; I was not. During that five years, before I went to the University of California at San Francisco , myolder brother brought home some Toto kittens. I was the one, at least, with the toys. And I was the least smart cat, which meant at least my other family had some knowledge of the cat business. “The one cat was smart, and the other cat was dumb.” “But they were both smart, and they were both dumb, because those two dumb cats were my cousins on our mother­land. I never got over that. “They were black. They were dumb. Their name was Toto.” I was always the smartest cat. My dad had taught me to never use words with that sort of meaning. He was a man of action. It was his style. “Do not waste words.” Toto was smart, but he was dumb. “Well, you can have Toto.” “Yeah, yeah.” “Well, at the end of the day, what matters is that these two dumb cats were your cousins. We love them.” Oh, good God—that scared me. Toto was my oldest, most trusted friend. My mom always said that the smartest people in the family are those you spend a lot of time with. But there is no mistaking who Toto was a quarter of an hour earlier. We couldn’t stop talking about him. It was like I was born out of the ether. We were both raised with him, but at the very core, Toto and I knew we wanted to be like our mother and father, and we would never be like them. We loved our mother for her courage, her strength, but we knew what it was like for them to be neglected and abused. My father didn’t care about those things. He cared about his kids, which was understandable. He cared to raise them. But to the day I was born, there was never an argument or a conversation about his kids. He never brought up race from one conversation to the next. A lot of black people say, “Oh, I am lucky. I have two sets of brothers, and even though they are different from that, they feel like my brothers are like them. Because of that, I know that even though I am a colored brother or a colored child I’m not that, no matter what they look like and no matter what they say. It doesn’t bother me if there are two black brothers in my life, because they’re just like me.” “What do you mean?” a white person might ask. “I know there have been colored people in my life. It makes no sense. Because they look like me? Why do they have to be colored instead of colored like me? Why can’t we just be the same color?” My dad wasn’t having any of it. He was always saying, “It makes no sense. We are the same color. Who gets to decide what color someone looks like?” “There’s no need to be so specific. We’re going to be just as colored, just as different. You’re not going to change the color of your skin.” Then, the third time I’d asked him to explain, he’d had the last laugh, and he said, “You need to know what it means, because it means something to you.” It was the final, best thing that he’d ever said to me. And I remember that conversation. P.S. I never did grow up without my Uncle Max’. That’s where my Uncle Max came in. He was a big, good-looking guy, too. When I was six, my mom made an important decision. Max was moving to England to work at a fur company. It’s a small country, so there wasn’t much to do, but my mom wanted us to go see the world. Max was a young, impressionable boy, with an adventurous spirit. One afternoon, his father, who did manual labor in England every day, came home from work. He offeredto train our son. It was a chance for him to see and do something useful for a living. We loved this idea. It was life-changing for us. There was some problem with the generator at school, but I was the fastest kid in my class, so I was the star. My mom made our plan, and we went to the school's library. After a while our computer failed so hard, I couldn't remember how I got the letter, but on a shelf was a photo of my friend Max hanging out in the school playground, naked and high on pot—on top of us. It was his mom, holding him in bed, holding his shirt off. Max was just as much my brother. And that's why he was more interesting than I was. He was so funny, too. I didn’t mean his sense of humor, either. I meant just his sense of sarcasm! You know where he was during his whole day? Sitting naked in his bed. I felt like he was right there with me in the room. It had been a week since Max had gone out; he was out with his friends. I was in class, and it was still afternoons, which just meant that there wasn’t really any schoolwork going on or anything. Max was in the class, but it was not the same. This was just a bunch of dumb kids hanging out in the playground doing what they did best—playing video games. It was the first time I knew what a game was. Games were what you played on the screen. You could turn it on and off, or tap it, swipe, or hit the buttons. It was the way television was in high school, too, except you had buttons and you played games. I was the most obsessed with Max. I loved him from the time I could look at him, at least. He was the first person I ever called by my name. All other names I had come up with in my head were "Max." We called him Max. Max. Max. Max. Max. Max. When he’d go around town, we would just hang out in the school park, just hang out playing games. No schoolwork. Nothing. We would sit here by the water, sunbathing on sunbaked grass, watching the waves crash against the sand, the waves crash against the cliffs. Max’s cousins lived in a neighborhood with houses that had brick walls and stone rooftops, like my house, and we had to walk up and down their road to go play in the open air. A lot of my friends in my family would have houses, or have a two-room house, but we couldn’t afford a three-room house. There was no garage. We had no basement. We didn’t have an enclosed yard. The only thing this family had in common was that they loved video games. I remember playing games my whole life. I played for a month at five on my dad’s computer in his bedroom. He turned on the TV. There was Minecraft, a video game about building a robot. Then there was Wario, another game about making a sword. Then there was Donkey Kong. My dad’ s computer would get to a certain point where it would crash and burn, and we would be left holding the pieces together, wondering why the whole thing didn’t get to work. I remember the first time we had the joy of a two-room house. My dad was a machinist, working at a car body shop. His brother lived in the back of the house, which meant he wasn’t home for the entire week. My grandfather and aunts gave me my own space in the backyard outside the gate, as an escape from the hustle and bustle of the town. When I was little, my grandparents were always out, working. If my mother needed any sort of transportation back or forth to get me to school, our family would come pick us up. We had a two-room house. They had a four-floor house, which was a three-story structure with a backyard. And then there was always me and my cousins and us, hanging out on the lawn, playing and hanging out, watching all this TV that had video games all over it. I remember my mom saying to us, “You can watch this video game all summer long, “ but if they make toys for you to play with,” she said, “we’play one game all summer long,” but if they made toy dolls for you to own instead, “We’ll play another game all summer long,” then, yeah, we won “t.” It wasn’t fun. That was when I decided that if toys mattered more than people, then my life was over. When we moved to West Lothian, West Lothian was the most white-populated slums in the city that no white person had visited in a long time, in West Lothian you were like, Oh shit, that’s the future!!! We lived in the biggest neighborhood, the most affluent neighborhood, but everyone knew no one lived here. There was no traffic, no public transport that ran. There was nothing to do other than eat, drink, live. At home, I’d listen to hip-hop. Hip-hop was everywhere. The streets where our mom and my grandma used to live where a lot of kids went to hang out in their cars. We’d go walk through the streets, because the best place to hang out in an area is at that block or another block that has nothing to do with what you’re going to do in the streets of L.A. When I was growing up in the South Bronx, a kid would come to meet me at my mother―s house, and he’d ask her where my aunt was. I’d put them together so they would all look alike’and she’d say, “Where is your Aunt Rufus? We always hang out there, and she’s so nice.” She would then say something about how my aunt was my aunt in the South Bronx. Then I’d say, “That’s your Aunt Rufus!” I was that kid. Lonnie would always come home from work early. He was always running back and playing with his friends. “What’s the grandkids playing now?” I’d ask. It was hard to be a kid in America and never interact with your white peers, but my mom gave me more opportunities. She was the only person I could talk to at work and see when they were out. And I didn’t care. At home my mom never said no—unless it was something she felt was completely in her interest. If Lonnie and I ever fought, they were my cousins fighting. My mother was more likely to tell me what to do than my uncle, the middle child. If we wanted to play, my mom would let me and my cousins play. If I wanted to be a man, my mom told me. If Lonnie ever fought, he was always going to fight a black person. For that matter, I was going to fight them all the time. I think I became the epitome of a violent person. I got involved in fights at a very young age because of something my mom said. I think she had some crazy idea. — It was summertime. Lonnie was my second cousin, right around when my sister and my best friend were coming of age. A summer holiday would start at least three days later each year. I was a wee bit younger than my cousin and sister and friend, and while my cousin and sister got off to an early start, Lonnie was the least excited of the group. Even in a tiny town, you get into some sort of trouble for having the youngest kids all together. It was my parents who organized the day of the festival. They rented a small hotel, some grass-and-garden plots, and let them keep it as a family picnic. My stepfather and I rented a car, which we rented for the whole trip. They had set up camp on a hill, and it was our job to park outside our house and go to the park around noon on the back lot. We did our best to make some friends. When I turned ten-years-old, my mother and two of her sisters were divorced. There was trouble brewing in my family. My stepfather didn’t like the way my mom and my cousins treated my older brother, Domenico. He wouldn’t allow them to get along; if theydidn’t get along, he’d break things up. I didn’t like being around him, and I was going to the girls’ house with a rifle. I had been teased before about shooting for fun, but I had never really liked it. I didn’t do it at home. The more I got kicked around the house, the easier it was to come home and see the bruises and the black eyes under my dad. If things got physical in the house, my mother knew to come down and clean it up. “You need to understand this. The boys in your life, you know what you get? You get your brothers. But what will happen to the girls? What will happen to the other girls? You’re a slave to your brothers. We’re going to beat your brothers. They have to beat you as well.” The abuse at the girls’ house, my stepfather told me, was the price of doing business. “You better make a better living than that, because I’m going to kick you and the house in return. If you don’t, maybe your kids won’t. Then your kids won’t either.” The first time his gun ran out, my mom had to bring it to the family doctor to get it renewed from another gun. But she was so good to her stepfather that that had never been an issue before. I was an 8-year-old child and this is all the things his mother did for him? To support and nurture us and provide us shelter, love, security, and freedom? She was the single most intelligent woman on earth. My dad used to tell me, “The mother doesn’t bring home the bacon. She makes that happen. The father works the extra shift. That’s all I’m paid for every month! And don’t tell me,” he would say, “How can I teach you how to cook?” “You're going to have to get your hands dirty.” I used to love the story my mom told me. At the time, my mother was a single mother raising four daughters on my own and no husband in sight. We had a small one-room cabin at our home in the mountain. My mom cooked our meals, cooked my favorite food for me: lamb stew. We’d cook it for myself, but all the others around us would call it by its natural name, which was stew. I grew up on stew: a hearty stew made from lamb and beef and vegetables, and I loved how it changed the texture of meat. Every Sunday, my mom worked three nights a week to provide for our family during our short downtime from school. The only way for her house to have electricity was if she lived nearby. There was no running water to flush out the basement or run the electric bill. My parents kept all their plumbing in the basement. My mom could keep it simple: two water filters, one toilet, a shower, and a sink. When my sister came to live with us in Cape Town, my mom would cook for her, wash her clothes, dry her hair. In the morning, my mom would wake up and clean my sister”s room. After my sister got ready for school, she cooked for my mom, too. After school, my mom would sit down with me for the meal and prepare the table. After the boys came over for recess, our kids all cooked for dinner. As long as things remained on a shoestring level, that was great. I never really thought of it that way. I never tried to live in a house where a nickel went missing every month. When my father needed me for a routine job, he would come clean about the money he made on my mother’s salary. We always had an arrangement, though. After the job, we’d have dinner, then go to a nearby shop to buy things. I wasn’t hungry that day. For the umpteenth time in my life I had been told the whole time I should stay home and work. In my mind I didn’t care much. I’d just stay home and go to work every time. But as soon as I got to the store to buy bread for lunch, my parents would call me. “Go eat a bite of this or that.” “Get ready. This or that’s coming!” If they asked me why, Iwould talk to them. When they tried to keep me from eating, I knew the only answer to my own question was “What have I done, stupid child??” “How dare you?” “How dare you?” “Do you know what you've done to me and my family? It is horrible, and the longer I don’t understand what’ss happened, the more I’m hurting,” my younger sister explained. I thought my dad would hate me for making this statement to her. I felt like he knew the answer. After all, I was still an idiot: I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but in the end, that’s what I thought and I was the idiot that said it. “You really must get ready, because I’m leaving today because I found a dead body near the car,” he told me.” They always said I was smart. I thought this was an overreaction to make my mom feel bad. My mother liked to think that the main reason she had such an easy life was that my father was never a huge part of the picture. Like my dad said: He loved kids more than anything. My childhood was not as happy an experience for him or mine. I grew up with aunts—my real mom, my grandmother, all the sisters—and cousins. My sister Ayn and her stepmother, also my first cousin, my father-in-law's mother, my great-grandmother, aunts, uncles, the extended family. Every year I was the youngest kid of the family all over again. That’s the thing about my dad being on my phone all day, texting my mother every five seconds, my cousins all the time, talking to me every ten minutes: He knew my phone, too. If I had the phone, I would be able to make him feel guilty about whatever he did to bring me into this relationship. I wasn’t. I felt more like he had my back. He would make me feel guilty. If I had the phone and I had nothing to hide, I wouldn’t have a hard time keeping it. My dad had a great eye for a woman. He saw every little thing in a woman’s face, from her skin to the way she smiled at you. He knew exactly what he was looking for. And I could always count on him. “What can I get you?”” I would cry out in the street. I always had the biggest smile. And I could always count on him to find the right moment to tell me what was on his mind. “Oh boy,” my mom would cry, “you have a killer smile.” Then, when I cried, she would tell me, “Take a look at your smile.” It was a combination that was almost perfect. We loved to laugh at each other. It never occurred to anyone that it was creepy to me that my dad would call me by my female name. That was a secret for him—a way for him to pretend to be me. I remember the time some girl from the dance club one night told me she wasn’t coming out to see me because she knew I hated her. So, when the DJ said if I wanted her to come and dance with me, I took her up to her house and we hung out outside for a while, getting to know each other. Then she came back downstairs and said she wanted to hang out again and so did I. From that point on, I never asked my mom for permission to hang out, even when we spent one night hanging out by myself. When she came home from work, she never came right around and stayed for dinner. I figured the reason was that my dad thought that I was a woman and so he knew how to treat me the way he felt he owed her. His only problem with us being friends in this relationship was that my mom didn’t share his feelings about being with a woman. She saw his behavior as something she didn’t understand and tried to fix it for him. When you are young, you learn how to pretend that women won’t cheat. You learn to be a man’s best friend. We are two separate worlds, and if one person tells you to do something and you doit anyway, you know that person doesn’t have a soul. I learned that for the first time, over the summer break when we’d hang out at the studio, and I took it upon myself to make it fun. ‹Hey, man, I’ve been waiting all summer to tell you this! Come over!” In that day I had a good feeling that I was doing something right. I felt like I had an ally on the other end. I had a few other guys in my life who were as cynical as me, in fact, they’d tell me all the time, “It’s not that simple, man. Look, if God created Adam and Eve because they were beautiful and perfect, and we thought it was funny, we got what we deserved.” I knew what “everyone’s” reaction was going to be once they saw me. I’d been through it already. At least I was used to it by now, so I knew how to handle it. I was never a good communicator. I didn’t know how to speak clearly and fast, so I always said what I needed to say to get a conversation going. The guys around me would ask, “What are you saying?” I never said much. But once we started laughing hysterically, I knew exactly what I was talking about. Then I used those moments to build my rapport with the woman. “You can’t say anything serious.” “Look. “Why don’t you stop it? Don’t you understand, man? It’s funny, it’s not meant to be funny?” That was the point of my comedy, but it wasn’t the only funny thing about the show. I was funny for the show. I knew how to get under the woman's skin and then use it for the show. I would walk around the studio trying to impress her with my charm, my funny, witty lines, how much fun I had. You’d think, What in the world is this man doing? He would pull something at me. I used that as an opportunity to build up the character—and I loved it that way. My lines didn’t change. “I’ll never get bored of being here. I just think you’re funny.” I also knew that no matter what I said, there would always be another person coming after me to defend my cause. We never hung out at parties, never went anywhere to eat, which is one of the reasons I got into such a good group of friends when I was growing up: We’d hang out in the back, and we’d take a break from parties for lunch—a plate of tuna, an iced tea, some fruit, a piece. We’d sit at a table together, eating the food we brought and making small talk about life and death. And if a man was around to make a move, I’d pull my own trigger, because you couldn’t be mad at your own joke. No one can be like, Fuck! I just don’t like that guy! How dare I give out information? That guy could be in on the whole whole thing. I know how to hit back at that. I knew what would work on television, how to hit back at the cameras: The punchline and the way the punchline was said. I knew the most successful lines on sitcoms, and I could pull the most iconic lines. I knew how to keep a crowd laughing at my expense. If someone said something that I hated when I laughed it was because I disliked what they were saying. If, on the other hand, I liked a line because I liked it I couldn’t hate it, which was why it stayed in my repertoire. Even if it was a bad thing to yell at me, I knew that I could hit them over the head with it. “I know when a man hates a girl. Just because she is beautiful, doesn’t mean she’s a good girl.” “Hey, baby girl, stop yelling!” “You look so fucking attractive to me. You feel like you’re perfect. You don’t need to be with anyone. Stop it.”“I love you. Just stop it.” “You can be the girl you want to be, if you―re honest with yourself.” —A young woman in India. “You are beautiful.” The girl smiled. “Really? How dare you tease me, sweetie?” Her smile turned from a playful to a sad smile. Her eyes softened. “I’m very sorry.” “This is nothing serious.” I thought they had ended a long day of arguing. My parents have never called me by my real name. When I’m younger, my dad would refer to me as “Johnny” to distinguish us, and he never used it anymore. When I was a kid, I learned not to use the first name of my deceased sister for any reason. I was blessed, by that point, with a family of six. My dad wasn’t a huge fan of the name Johnny; he hated “Johnny, Jesus,” my mom used to say. He liked his brother. So my mom named me Mary, like my daddy was named John. “You do not name your children Johnny or Jesus, or even Jesus Mary!” “You name your children Mary and not Jesus!” My mom would yell and I would run away in terror. My other aunt did not understand why she was being told this. She didn’t know how to deal with it, either. They had moved back in with her family, after my grandmother gave them a run for their money. She taught me the rule of family, and the way it works is that you call the person by their first name, like Mary and not Jesus or Jesus Jesus. In my experience and from the time I learned from my grandfather about not calling my sister Mary. “She should be called Mary.” “It’s better that way.” “No cursing in the street.” She didn’t understand I was screaming. “Stop yelling!” “Whoa, whoa,whoa. You shouldn’t be throwing around that word,” she said. “It is not a Christian word, and it does nothing for us Muslims. I don’t think Jesus would have said that.” “What’s the problem?” “What’s the problem?” she said “I think this girl used the N-word?” “What language did she use?” she demanded. “That’s what it means: The Lord is gay.” “No! You’re a racist! You're a bigot! Why don’t you go back to Africa to tell your ancestors what to do? It won’t work! You’re evil! You are the devil! Get out of Africa! Go to North Africa and kill other people!” “No! I don’t have my parents living with me. I have my own mother and two brothers. If you want me to learn that language, go out wherever you want.” “My mom will never understand!” “I’m not taking your word for it.” “This is my cousin” “My cousin says that.” That is his nephew! That is my uncle! That is my nana! That is my little sister. “You think you can separate us?” “Well, I don’t even want to hear you guys say that!” “What?!” “No.” “It’s a joke.” “Why not? Do you realize how stupid it would be to say that? There were plenty of white babies around during apartheid. There were black babies everywhere. “Why would you say that?” “No.” — My family still believed in a racist, God-centered afterlife. The white man in me still relished the idea that my cousin Mary had the power I did not, but I did not want her to have anyone else. “Hey, I donbelong in there either.” I was never sure why. The only answer she seemed to give me during those days was “Well, whatever. It is what it is. God created you this way.” My family never wanted me to see that way. It was clear they didn’t understand how much life in prison felt like slavery to them, and as a kid who'd always lived in an idealized life, it didn’t make any sense to live life by that same ideal. I grew up black, not just black, but African-American, always seeing this as another place for America to hide. But, at one point, my dad came into my life completely changed. Marlene, my mom, was a wonderful mother. We lived near the South African border, a couple of hours' drive from Soweto, which was a real luxury. She worked as often as ever and was always available. But in all the years that we shared her home, she never took me under her roof. At least, I didn’t see any reason I should. I was a rebel who did what I did, and my father was a hard working man who never asked for my permission. So I couldn’t get into trouble for what I did. It wasn’t like I couldn’t do it, though my step-grandmother was pretty strict about it. “You don’t touch my nappy or nampak. It would be like you touching your mother in the kitchen, which is very dangerous,” she famously warned me. Marlene was my guardian angel. I liked to spend holidays at home with her by myself. We'd walk the length and breadth of the family’s neighborhood, enjoying the scenery, drinking the local beer, doing nothing but sitting on the ground and praying. She'd stay in the house all night and get ready for bed at dawn. When she got up in the morning, I’d sneak out behind the house to my room and run outside, sneaking under the bushes. If anyone found my path, I was there to kill them. If I caught sight of them, I would sneak up behind them, get out my gun, shoot 'em with it. I could be a real badass. My mom was super organized. After my time in jail, one day she told me, “The white people are coming to reclaim their country from the black people. And you are one of them.” She had this kind and funny voice, too. As sweet as a child could be, that voice was reserved. “The white people will come.” She didn’t make fun of black people in those days. We’d sit around and have a long conversation. Sometimes we’d have lunch at a restaurant or we’d have our own lunch at a hotel or wherever. Occasionally she called us up to do our thing at the table in the kitchen, but that was it. Not once did we discuss her coming with us. “We’re out of here.” A little while later, she turned to me, and said, “Look, Mabel, I can tell that you need to get your own room. “But this time it’s your choice.” “Why? Is this a joke?” “No,” I said. “I’ll tell Mom that you and Mommy have been messing around in the yard for hours, and I’ll bring something new to your table for today.” She laughed. “Well, there”s nothing funny about that. No one would joke about it.” “Just leave it alone.” “No, please.” Mabel, who was just shy of nine, was one of those stubborn kids that just wouldn’t take no for an answer, so I played along. “Mom, it’s really just a metaphor. I’m not kidding. It is a metaphor.” “That’s enough.” I wasn’t playing along, because, well, at least now I know why. One night that same week my mom was going on about how she wasn’t having my birthday party, I jumped into her car to walk to the house. I remember this because my mother would always start with us saying exactly the same thing at the same time. A couple months afterour birth, my mother had had a stroke and had a casket taken away from her. She had an aneurysm and, as a child, I don’t recall very much, but the reason they took the casket was to bring my father back to life. My mother’s family had grown up in a home where all manners of sexual violation and sexual abuse were routine. In my mom’s home, all boys were groomed and shamed at birth, but in our neighborhood, if a boy wanted to play around with a girl he was punished. If we caught a kid doing this, we would whip them, sometimes beating their backs into the ground. The punishments were so severe that they became known as white-on-black and yellow-on-blue. I remember the first time all that happened to me was the time my mom’s boyfriend beat her son, Aaron. They were sitting in the living room, looking at one another and saying to one another, “Do the same, boys. You have to do the same.” What my mom could not do at the time was give consent. For a long time, whenever Aaron was around girls, I was his only sexual contact. I was the only person who could touch him and tell him to do whatever it was. Once, I was twelve years old, and Aaron and some friends had come over from the suburbs. Our house was an overpopulated, middle-class home, like the posh suburban sprawl of South Africa. There were two white girls living with me, one white girl of color, and the other black girl from the suburbs. Aaron came over with me, and we started playing together. I was six or seven years old when I first learned this. There were two sets of rules for my mother. My mother was very strict. She would not leave us alone to play. I remember that one day when my mother wasn’t around we were playing in the backyard. I went inside and sat on the fence just to see what was going on. At first Aaron and a group ran around, grabbing food. As the other girls were doing it, my mother came out to watch us. She said, “Look! They are coming from the woods! They came from the woods!” Everyone looked at them in disbelief and I was completely dumbfounded like they were completely crazy. Then my mother got to it, and we all went back to the house playing until she came and shut the door in their faces. Aaron was eleven at the time, and Aaron was a wild, competitive kid. We’d play together all the time. He’d hit me. I’d hit him. We played together all the time. He was so wild, he could chase us around for hours with no regard for the rules. It made me incredibly uncomfortable. I remember the first time my mom slapped me in the face was the time we played together, the night Aaron was six, while my mother had just given birth to my brother. I remember this the best, because there was no other way for us to play than by ourselves. Aaron had this tiny motorbike that he had brought to use as a toy that he had bought with the money from my grandmother, which he liked to play with and ride around on the dirt track. Then the day before the birth of my brother, my mom got home and told me how she would punish me for this: “You must not play with the motorbike. I don’t accept it anymore.” Since the motorbike wasn’t in the house, my mother didn’t give me a choice. They made me pick: play with it and tell the girl my mom loved, or play alone and tell the girl who wasn’t like her and not to come over. The choice I made was always the same. I went, “I choose the bicycle,” and the motorbike came down the steps, right into the family’s backyard. My mom took the motorbike and started beating it like crazy, trying to break it to pieces. I turned to watch and there was Aaron coming over with his friends to play, and just as I realized I wasn’t going to be punished, the door slammed behind me. Aaron hopped on top of my mom, and the blows just didn’t stop. It was a violent assault. It was just like a fight, only without the blood and the broken skin. My mom didn’t stop. She went up to Aaron, and my favorite word for her was cIt was hysterical. “What you are doing is sick!!!” “Are you sure?” “What’s he doing?” The kid was crying all the time; I just wanted to say it to make him mad. And I’d gotten a lot of anger from him already. “You don’t understand me. You don’t understand me!” My mom and I were still friends then. After the attack, everyone just sat in silence, stunned and speechless. But she kept telling him to tell it like it was, so eventually there came a moment when he did what had to be done. “Do it!!” She said. “Do it quickly.” “You mean shoot this guy?” “No. Don’t shoot that guy. Please. Please, please.” “Please!!” She pleaded. “Please don’t kill this guy!!!” “No.” He had to do it. He did what had to be done, because he was the best at what he did. “Please’t shoot these people, too! Please don’t shoot those people!!!” “No.” What he didn’t understand was that what made a person do something was not his skill in it, but his lack of skill in it. He was being like, “Well, you did a good job! You did a good job!” He didn’t know how. I love a character like that because it creates a tension that makes people respond and even fight, like they’re playing a game. In a movie, it’s a fight scene. In real life, a person who kills someone, he or she is the one who doesn’t kill, because the stakes are too high. But in a film, if someone has a chance at killing someone, they are usually the one who kills. The audience can’t let that be them. If your character kills someone, he becomes the hero. If your character doesn’t kill someone, he becomes the monster. You get a point for killing someone, but at least you know the guy who killed was a killer. The other great moment in the movie was a scene in which a cop in a white car was coming around the corner in front of us—and we could see the red lights of the car, the sirens, flashing in the distance. “Get out! Help! Please!” “No, thank you, my friend.” “No, thank you, dear. We just shot someone with a laser gun.” The laser? My mother’s mom was into laser guns. “This guy! He shot my baby baby at the end!' “That’s what we shoot at people with? Who uses lasers?!‘ “Well, it works by illuminating someone using lasers. That’s why we don’t know anyone uses lasers for anything except for hunting and killing monsters.” That wasn’t the first time my mother would have us use our own weapons to fight back or make us feel like warriors. The most famous fight that Aaron fought in my life involved us riding our motorcycles into a house in the hills surrounding Tula. Aaron was an incredibly ambitious youth who wanted to be as famous as any other rapper from the era of the MC Don’t Come Home. At home in Tula, my mom had a mini-dance studio right outside the family’s house that she set up to create the best possible versions of popular dance tunes. So when they would play a dance song, my mom’s house would be up and running from 7:00pm till 1:00am, playing that song along with the newest rap music, which my mom would be the official DJ. It was a perfect blend of house and dance. On the road, it was a totally different matter. The DJ was someone named Shabazz, who was a super creative DJ. Every morning he would wake up and prepare a set called “I’m Jiggy,” so everyone knew what he was up to and what it was all about. Shabazz and I were bothinto beats, and we thought Jiggy was dope. So Jiggy and me drove up, and my first thought upon meeting him was, “Oh. I’m in.” “I don’t know what I did wrong,” he said. We decided to have a little party, which was like going to the grocery store with a bunch of friends. There we went, standing in line, all dressed in their favorite colored shirts. Everyone drank orange juice and listened to our set. Then Jiggy took us all out for dinner, which was where he first hooked us up with his amazing DJ staff, including his partner “Dani’ Dorza. “Dani was my cousin” and it was our favorite dancehall joint in New Jersey after that club called The Grove, where the dancehall was on a whole different level and where everything is dope. The DJs were amazing, because every day at Dani’”’s house we watched Jiggy perform while the DJ’s staff turned on the music. It was like going to an entire house of DJs—you’d get the same set, but the DJ would have DJ Zeds and the beat would be different every time. “Dani’s the best out there. My cousins would get me my favorite songs, and I’d listen to those songs all night while my DJ and crew played the music. It wasn’t as if we knew the songs from the cover on which to dance and how to perform, or what instruments would be great, or anything like that. We just danced the beat and played that song. If anything, there were moments when I was like, “Why the fuck am I staying here?” But the DJ was just so fun. We had a great time. Jiggy and I were just the best. The parties were so much fun and so easy. It was never more obvious that we were two darlings in the boudoir competition than the parties when we both came out to play the same party together. Sometimes people get excited when two women compete, sometimes they get excited when two men compete. We got into a frenzy playing the same game, competing to be the best DJ at the same time. We both took turns as host, dancing as best friends in a circle. At the same time, we both enjoyed getting a little too drunk to keep everyone at bay. We’d both had a whole keg at the same time. The parties were the best thing about our childhood. We were inseparable. But then something happened two decades ago, and the two of us began to struggle. Every Sunday we went to the cemetery to mourn for an uncle who died in an auto accident. My family had a small plot next to our home on top of a hill along with our aunties and my cousins. This plot was our backyard, and every Sunday we would come there to spend the day with our grandparents. That was until one day my dad passed. I remember it was like the sun setting behind my grandfather. All he did was wake my mom when he went to sleep. I was 9, and I couldn’t stop crying as he made his way to the house, and he took me by the hand and led me to my custodian. “Dear Dad, it’s the last time I’m gonna visit your house tonight. If I never see you again, I’m not letting you know the way our relationship ended. I never want you to regret how the death of my mother has changed me. I don’t know how I could ever let such a cruel, cold heart into my heart. You said this to me in one conversation, but you must have known it to be true at least subconsciously because you kept saying it. “We never get older than I am.” And then one day I told my dad the truth, and it was his worst day since my mother had broken up with him. He was the happiest man in the world. As we mourned that terrible day where I lost my mother, he went through an emotional breakdown too. He wasn’t the father-fearing, “I won’t even talk about it.” There was no bitterness or resentment there. It was as if he was in a state of shock, because he hadn’t spoken tohim in years. In my family, my mom was always the strong woman. If something went wrong, she knew that she had to get it right before she moved ahead. She was hard at work every day. But she couldn’t be that tough, because that would be like my dad being a perfect example of how you could beat up a perfect woman with the most perfect of intentions. So my mom had a great amount of self­-control, but not enough to not do what was called for. It was the exact same problem with Jaws. I was scared to step out of line. I wasn’t allowed to. I knew my mom always had me to her side. But because it was my fault everything got caught in the act. That was one of her greatest strengths, especially when it came to dealing with violent situations. Jaws was a product of her childhood. Not that I blamed her, because it was her choice — she came to the table with me. In my childhood I wanted to be a star athlete or a great singer, but to succeed as an adult I needed to find other opportunities. In my life as a kid there were times that I went crazy trying to fit into mainstream culture. That was one of the worst experiences of my life. I wasn’t allowed to grow up in a normal way. I didn’t get to experience it in life. But Jaws brought me to a point where I could see that my only option was either stay under the radar or play the games they made me do. So I was in my room for a long time trying to stay out of the movies, which was also the most intense form of survival training. The movies, the movies were all I was given. Any time a movie came out, it was as good as it'd ever get. You could sit on the couch all day and never even think about putting on your costume to go to the theater. I remember the last time we had popcorn, I was so young. So we started smoking weed. And when there was nothing else to do but smoke weed, I’d get together with some of my friends, and we’d smoke as many movies as we could get our hands to. Then we’d have fun, and then we’d take a break for a few weeks. As we grew up those movies would come more and more. For example I think my favorite from the period between the films of Akira and The Matrix was The Man of Tai Chi. It’s a classic Chinese Kung‑Fu story. The best part is the last scene of the movie is when a kung fu fight breaks out. And it turns out that the fight had nothing to do with Bruce Lee. It was the last straw for the kung fu master. Bruce Lee wasn’t the black belt in the martial art of Tai Chi, so he had no interest in getting involved in this fight. I never spoke to him about it. That was the end of that movie, so for me, that was a good day. And to be frank with you, this man was beyond badass. When I was ten years old that movie was my first exposure to Bruce Lee. For me it was when I walked in the front door, my mom walking up behind me, and my dad running up to the porch. The fight that was in the backyard was over the kung fu master. I was so excited. I ran up to the porch and jumped off my bed right in the middle of the fray, and it just exploded. I jumped from the bed as hard as I could. I don’t know what happened next, but I landed flat on my back and bounced up and down on the grass like it was nothing. It was as loud as it was beautiful. My mom, I didn’t really know her at the time. I didn’t play with her. She wasn’t a person who interacted with me. “He’s just watching the fight go down.” When I jumped the whole thing hit the front side of the house like an earthquake. There was blood everywhere. As if the whole town had been razed to the ground. One of the soldiers jumped over a wall to rescue me, and when he reached me I was on a gurney with a bunch of holes in me. He gave me a big, broad bandage and asked me to try it on. He had me put on a splint and started bandaging me up inside my body. Before long I felt like I was going crazy from the neck down. All the other soldiers at the scene were on theirknees with hands over their eyes, waiting for me to stop and calm down. And every time I got too close, they would hit me right across the face. I was terrified. For a long time, I didn't even think about what I had done. I only really thought about how awful my mother was. She had so much hate that was unspent at her. I thought: I'm making history, and if you're a human being, it is a great thing. I didn't realize what that meant until I was very old. For whatever reason, even after all my rage, I kept thinking about who my mother was. All my life, she has shown me how to hate in return. My mother had said all along that she hated me. When she found out I was gay, her response, like the whole rest of her behavior, was to give me a piece of her mind. I got kicked out of school a couple of times. And for a short period, at least, I had to wear a mask, complete with a big smile, to hide the marks on my face. One afternoon she gave me some sort of candy with a name that made me look like an angel. When she gave me the candy when I was 14, the thought of having to live a lie terrified me. But this time, I was just taking the candy, so I took her back. After getting the candy, I got home and ate a few bites, and then I knew that whatever she was eating I wasn't gonna like, I wasn’t gonna eat, and God, I hated it. That candy was the worst thing ever. I took my revenge for the other soldiers who beat me the other day. That evening at school I made a vow to God: “Trevor, you better get inside of your mother’s house.” That night, before I left to go off and live with my uncle, I had decided that the only way out for me in that scenario was to kill myself. My uncle always had a special brand of anger—he beat people up and then put them next to him and watched them die in his family’s backyard. So the fact that he was my only outlet for that anger was a complete bonus for me. Every Friday after school, we did what he did: We would start around nine in the morning, and by evening there would be a bonfire and we would kill all of God’s enemies together—the demons that had come looking for his son. The whole time, I had a plan for how this would go, a set of rules I was going to live up to, and I knew exactly what I’d have to do. I sat at my uncle’s house, put my gun in our garage, and began writing a letter to my mother. It was not long before there was a knock on the door. My uncle answered it. He was a huge crackpot. He couldn’t even read the letters he was writing in front of us on his TV. He came by the farm every few hours to get this stuff done, and even then he was just trying to impress his wife and keep us alive. From time to time he’d let us know that he’d finished with whatever task he had, but he’d never let us know how much it had cost, because otherwise we wouldn’t be making the trip every couple years. I was so desperate for information, I wanted to find out what a ton of money was required to get rid of this demon, because the more the merrier. So I walked over and stood by his front door and started the letter. “My dear child...I do understand that you and your brother live in a house far away from our family. This family has no connections to your home...you and your brother have lived in this community, but have never set foot within the circle of people who support your family. I understand your need for privacy in doing this. But this will not alter what my responsibility as your father is: As your father, I am here with you right now praying for you to receive the precious gifts that I offer you. I pray through you what they say can happen, and I ask you to pray how you can make those miracles that God cannot do. I beg you to know, whatever you choose to do I will do in your place for the rest of your life. So help you, Lord, because I know God will be with you, and as a result you can make me the most powerful being on the face of this earth. “Peace be withyou, Jesus. I can’t believe he didn’t stop the Holocaust. “How could He do that to His own people?” One afternoon I was driving home from church with my brother. We were headed to a nearby town, but it didn’t feel like town—this was where the Nazis lived. At first I thought our destination was the ghetto, or a place like that. But as we pulled into a small town I realized there was a whole different kind of ghetto. This town was a large refugee camp, surrounded by barbed wire and razor wire. I wasn’t surprised that we didn’t get pulled over as we tried to drive through here: Barbed wire and razor wire are horrible, so you should leave. But I was delighted that we didn’t. The road we were on wound up into what we later learned was a Nazi concentration camp. There are these giant metal fences around this particular area, some of which are about eighteen hundred feet long in all directions. They stop cars from speeding across it, and it has a system so that when those cars hit the barrier, a giant steel spike—an electrified spike—comes out of it and goes straight through their windscreen and into their windpipe. Every car, every motorcycle, every minibus, every minibus car, every bicycle, every skateboard, every skateboard van, all collide and fly up into a huge metal trough, and the thing that goes up and down the middle of it just sort of does its thing. Every car in the car park is trapped, and the road is full of them. There can’t be any way it could get away without electricity. All that metal and the electricity goes together. There wasn’t a single power line that ran through the middle of it, so every scrap of wood was connected to every other scrap of wood, and then the line would break and it would reconnect to some utility-company tower and we just had to power it up. I drove my mom, my stepfather, and our three children over. The house, as you know, was located along one side of this road, and all along this road are black plantations, basically white people’s only source of income. A lot of blacks and a lot of white people lived in the plantation—in this house that looked like this—for a long time. It burned down a while back, but it was still in decent working order. The other thing that struck me about this area was that the white people there worked on the roadsides in this area for a living. They got this amazing, hand-crafted road-hardened road-hardened machine. It was like a car. I didn’t know what a bicycle was until long after I had left the womb. And it just worked perfect, because it was so heavy it couldn’t handle the weight of the road without it. My stepfather built me a motorcycle when I was around four years old, and I loved it. I loved riding a motorcycle. My mom made me ride an older roadie’s bicycle the whole time we were in Cape Town. Then when I was twelve, I went off in my own little world and started tinkering with my own computer. I loved programming languages. There was only one way to express my creative thoughts through code—I just typed. I could remember every function. Everything typed up on my computer was there. I remember having to come up with all the different expressions and variables and functions that I could make. I was the only computer nerd on earth in my life who wasn’t an expert programmer. We used a program called C and C’s Fortran to write our programs. But I loved the code. I loved making things with C. My friends called the Fortran I played with, C, its cousin, Pascal. Pascal didn’t make any sense to me. It was this horrible code written down by some dude on the computer at home on an old HP monitor, but it had the power, and because it didn’t take up space, it saved my life. My mother gave me a book called Basic Algorithms in 1977. I was five when it came out. It was a black book full of mathematical explanations of everything in nature. In the back lay this sentence that had caught my attention. “If A is X, then Y. But if B is X, Y is not A; A is not B. Therefore B is not X, and therefore B is not not Y. If B is not A, then X is also not B. Therefore Aand B are both A because either A is either A or X is either X or B is X, both of which are impossible. [ edit ] Another famous example of the paradox of dualism is the famous saying, "If you want X to exist, write X down." For those unfamiliar with the proverb, if you want people to read your book, write it down on a piece of paper, which means you do not exist. If you want people to listen to your voice, sing your songs, dance your routines, dance your sets—that's a lot of fun as well. But if you wanted people to read it out loud on a piece of paper, you'd probably not make it out alive. Then there is the case of someone saying, "I cannot believe that you cannot believe." And that person is absolutely right. You cannot have it both ways: One person is the one who cannot believe; the other person is the one who is not capable of believing. In this world in which we live, if there is one God—and he does not give life, he takes it away–then one person cannot have it both ways. 8. God Is Evil. [ edit ] Some people think that people who think this way are really like, well, godless, that they can accept that God exists–and maybe there's some truth to that. If God doesn't exist, that's great [ edit ] You might wonder how, then, it has come to be the popular belief that everyone who doesn't believe in God does not really believe in anything at all. But if the idea of having no belief in God had not spread throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the problem would have been solved much sooner. For decades a majority of European adults believed that God was good and righteous; that was the Christian world view. This belief spread with the rest of the continent in the form of the Protestant ethic, which held you should work hard to achieve God's glory. By and large, the United States is just a Protestant state now: We have two major national religious parties: People say they're conservative with the Republicans, but their base is all conservatives. They don't vote conservative, like the Republicans in the Senate but like Donald Trump. Most Americans in the past quarter-century or so simply changed their party registration to the Republican Party for the first time. As recently as 2010, you had a pretty small percentage of Americans who actually voted for their national parties: Republicans. Then, just like in the past, the Republican Party nominated a party that was clearly on the way out. That party was Barack Obama. The rest is history, folks. 9. America is Great, Period. [ edit ] Everyone knows that Americans hate their guts. A lot. They can't live on their stomachs, and they can hardly chew on anything. People like that—that's the American way—but they're also right about one thing: America is better because of our guts. A hamburger for dinner isn't going to taste any better than one you cooked at home. A hamburger in your kitchen isn't going to give you anything more flavor than one at your favorite restaurant—a burger joint. Americans love their food, too. The great American burger, in our minds and ours, is a miracle of evolution. Like it or not, our best-known hamburgers are made in America. 10. We Live in the Country. [ edit ] Another thing people love to hate about America is that it is, literally, the only country on earth where you are allowed to own real land. No longer do we have any natural land on which to live, no roads to build roads, no rivers to catch rivers. People live on land that we can drive to from point B to point A as cheaply as from point C to point N. Our farms now include just the bare bones of small plots of farmland in which we grow all of the food we eat. We don't even bother planting the crops because it will only take so much for us to produce the grass. That grass grows back up and we leave it. The only land we have to use for growing vegetables comes from the government, which gives us the most limited land in the world. It's the only land that we cultivate. We make our beds on it. We build our houses on it. 11. All We Do All The Time Is Grow Vegetables. [ edit ] There never was a time when Americans did not grow vegetables; it just didn't count as "growing vegetables." As a nation we've been growing vegetables all our lives: Corn, squash, broccoli—pretty much all of the staples of American food. In fact, almost everything we eat is made in America: Our coffee is brewed in the USA; our beer isbrewed and bottled in Canada; our cheeses and pastries are made here. We have a grocery store and a coffee bar. My mother was a vegetarian since a baby; during our short trip abroad, however, a friend from England invited us to visit a vegan restaurant where they had all kinds of plant-based delicacies. The first thing we tried was the veggie burger at VegFest Berlin. The veggie burger was a bit big, but I didn’t think it was that large since it was mostly veggies, but the texture of it was so good—the texture was like a veggie burger but not much bigger—it was so good I didn’t want to devour it. Then I thought back to what VegFest was, and it was the perfect opportunity for me to go vegan. I loved eating at the restaurant. I was in love with it. Then I thought, what does a burger look like? In my mind, a typical American burger consisted of a juicy, greasy slice of hot dog with a patty of pickled jalapenos on it, and a big bowl of fried potatoes. I got a vegan burger.

My mom got me my own. It had hamburgers, fries, coleslaw. I remember waking up the first day in India with my sister, naked so far down into a puddle of rice I couldn’t swim. Then I woke up the second day in India with an umbrella, with the other kids. We were on the beach, swimming and playing in a sand pit, when the waves came. I didn’t even know what a tide was by that point. I just had some weird idea of when it got higher. In India, you had people hanging out in their yards and basking in the sun all day, then they come ashore, their houses made from coconut. In Kenya, you had the people who would get up at a time, wake up, and head back to bed. In India, you would walk from one house to the next, sunbathing, fishing, sleeping; in the backyard on that hot, rainy day in India, you’d be up all day, sunbathing. But in Kenya, the sun never set and the people moved forward as one generation continued to work the next century or so. I would often hear my parents joke that in India, they were like the dinosaurs of their time. It had been fifty years since anyone had set foot in those lands, so they were always talking about the one time they went into the deep sea. My childhood in Kenya began with some kind of adventure. My parents bought a farm, which they called Ngaio, which is pronounced 'neer'”. Ngaio was a small hamlet on the shore of Lake Victoria, roughly twenty-six hundred yards from where I lived, the house on the lake and a couple of houses on either side of it. They had a farm that they raised with the cows they still owned today, which is a whole lot of cows. But what I didn’t know then is that my father didn’t do the same. He raised chickens and ducks and other poultry, and when he wasn’t working as a farmer he was at a ranch outside the town of Rangoon. We had our chickens with me since I was three years old. One day, one morning my Mom told me to take my sister out and get a camera. She brought us along to a field, the kind with weeds and dirt, and we walked through to the house I lived in at that point. It was dark and dusty, and we saw a group of white parents, dressed in black, their backs to us in a white line. The white family was sitting around a large bonfire, making it look like dinner. There was the mother, who stood there in complete confusion. I don’t know what went wrong, but when I was eleven years old she didn’t move for almost an hour, because her baby brother had burned the house down in a fire. Then she did. My mom had to make do with her, and from there she went off and did what she did best: Went off to find a kid, picked the kid up, and took him on a ride. I grew up around horses, so when my mom took me to ride at the ranch it never occurred to me that she might be the one that gave me the first ride, or that I would ever ride a horse in these mountains. That would be another story. My mom wasn’t very good at being in the kitchen, so she always had her horses with her while cooking, and they were always out in the country. I used to always ride my old, battered-and-tired cousin, Big Boy, down to his house on a dirt road, the dirt road you ride on in the dirt when there has been no work done. Big Boy’s cousin, the donkey, kept coming over after he worked all day so that he could have more time to have more time for fun and games, and he took my mother around to his house one day. On the road we stopped at a house and watched as his mother and the girls, as they had been taught not to, started their morning activities and then left for work without saying a word, just as everyone else had done. So we waited for my mother. We waited for the time to say something. When it was finally time to greet them, we climbed over the wall to meet them in front of the gate, and, in front of the other white people, we said, “Hello!” They looked at each other and then atthe rest of us and said, “Where did you come from? Who do you serve?” It was one of those moments when you think, “This could blow up any second," but a few people in a group are more important than thousands, let alone millions? In South Africa, this was unheard of. In fact, in a sense it was a kind of national hero. It wasn’t just my race, but my people that had turned against me. It was like the police, or our leaders telling us who the bad guys were and going about our business. That was a day I’d never forget. As I watched the whole day play out, I couldn’t help but marvel at the power of those faces. They looked like people we couldn’t even see, not even close. People I didn’t even speak to in real life. I was just seeing them there. The same way we can see a face when we’re in pain; we see that same face just behind another person’s eyes. In the eyes of the person, the image becomes reality. That’s what faces do. They can transform lives. We had no cars, just a white pickup truck, two black Mercedes, a white Lincoln, and this white family. My friends and I were supposed to meet up at the hotel when we left for the airport, drive to a shopping mall, then park the truck and go our separate ways. We decided on a Saturday evening in November 2013. We drove up to our favorite white neighborhood, which was in Johannesburg’s wealthy and privileged middle-class zone. I sat in the backseat and watched the kids run through the streets, playing in the street, drinking, having a good time. On our way to buy some bread, our black friend came over and said, “Where’s your mom?” The kids looked at him like he was crazy. My mom came over and stood in the back and watched from an armchair. She couldn’t talk to them. She wasn’t sure what to do. That’s when it happened. “Hey!” I asked my mom. “I know mom.” “What?” she said. “Where’s your mom?!” I shouted. “What do you mean, where’s your mother?!” “She left before we knew it, but I’m very happy to see you again. Now, go get your bread, boys,” the kids said. They all laughed hysterically. “What? The fucking bread?!” “Yeah, no, he’d left before any of that. Let’s get out of here, now. We need to get out of here, now. “So, what is going on?!” I asked. “I don’t know.” my mother said. “You know what I’m going to do?” she said. “We are leaving,” she said. “Go get your bread. Go!” “Go get your bread?!” “No, Mom. Dad’s still here. There is another car, please.” “Why are we leaving?!」 I cried. “My mom. My mother is your mother. They say I need a protector.” They’re so mean. “You need a father?” I said. “Who are these men?! Are we supposed to be together?” “No.” “So what’s the problem?! Go get your bread,” my mom said. “Let’s leave. We don’t know what’s bothering us.” “Well, then, we can’t go out and get a snack.” “Let’s be honest. What can we have?” The kids began pulling out their phones to look at me. “I just thought maybe you’d gone the other way, so I could hug you like that.” ‘Whose other way?’“I thought it was your car. So I did it, too. So I can hug your car like you do my face. Now, how about you let me look? I want to see exactly how big your nose is, so I can tell if you suck or if you do well.” “You’re trying too hard! I know how easy that sounds, “But I’m just like you! I have snakes.” The kids looked at me, stunned. “What kind of snake were you?” My mom shook her head. ‘I don’t know. I think my parents were telling the truth. Maybe that’s what they thought I was. “What? No. I don’t like snakes.” “No, no, no. It’s not. It was a joke. You don’t like snakes. I mean, okay. But” She went on to explain why she let her kids do that. A few friends of mine who’d come over one day from England were sitting at our table in the kitchen. “I hope you’re coming here to watch TV for fun.” They looked at each other blankly. “I dunno” .” “You want television?” My sister asked, incredulous. “Why?” “Why are you here? You know what we’re doing.” “This isn’t family entertainment.” My family was extremely conservative in our view, so my mom didn’t even mention God or Jesus in the House. For example, I am not a believer. We’d discuss things like which religion a person belonged to all the time. My brothers and I, on the other hand, would take issue with one another. We would go on long, rambling tirades. “The Bible doesn’t teach you to be a good person because it doesn’t say God made good people. If it did, I would tell you to shut up and read it. I would throw it at you. It was so ridiculous it made me sick. You had to stay in the house and read the Bible, though. Not like there’s a Bible in this house, because that would violate all the rules: – No smoking – No playing – No eating – No drinking – No talking back to each other unless it was between us in private – No hanging out, at all times of day or night This strict and rigid view of morality drove me crazy. I was so religious that if you didn’t agree with Me, you didn’t believe in Me. The Bible was the only set of rules that I knew I could adhere to. If another person said the word 'hell,' my head would snap up. If they said the word 'barbarism,' I would smash one of the crucifixes around my neck. If they said the word 'greed,' I would go buy a knife and stab the other person. We had a large TV in the living room, a huge monitor in the middle of the living room. It showed everything. Everything. I used to get it all the time. There was video of my life on screen, along with news, cartoons, and movies from around the world. When we went to bed, I would watch everything on and listen to everything on through the night. So, whenever I wasn’t awake to watch television, I’d watch all the news. On TV, you were supposed to just go in and sit there and stay there while the others talked and played. But for some reason in America a man had to be able to go out and find someplace to hang out. He was allowed to go sit in the yard on his own. That was when my mom came to my defense. She told me that if you could just sit down and sleep, then if you wanted to go somewhere your whole life you didn’t even need to have the TV. You could just go and take a nap. My mom was a strong, stubborn woman. She always had been. Her mother was a lawyer and her father was a lawyer. “You should go to law school, Dad” she told her and my dad and my mom.
