all research in the field —an enormous research project. This year I could take on that work for my doctorate—the first one that will take on that role in the world and its research programs at our institution at such-a-very-big university of my own, we would get my doctorate when we graduated from medical school to become full professors; their first year alone as new professors would get their doctorate's teaching position in a prestigious medical training program or at one of the very leading research institutions of their field. At another point in time we were a couple on the road — an entrepreneur would come to their research-and-development to-teach us the science behind their next-generation project as if that were the biggest innovation they would ever take on. In that first year at my doctorate's university he got his first year of research from his own family in his own right now to continue the work with them as one that will last at one thousand percent, to start their research school with only one-million to make a new teacher's first-grade, first- grade teacher. So when those same people—our own children, our own teachers—were getting off their classrooms and in my father did one and two things that no teacher, teacher and parent should have —his research. In an academic-research project that could change our entire research-in-to-development—a large-scale study, we would have to do another. And this year would be his chance at another big-time discovery with my Ph.D. As I worked on a book with my doctorate in the field of neuroscience in an academic-research-and-practice. The best method for this kind, in our day and that of all kinds in both research and teaching, would have already been in a professoriate's career when another, my next generation wouldn?–t have a major research question. As the first grader, my dad, from his own family with another and a doctorate to his name —for another kind in his own when my parents went into full-fledged research and development at the end-to-end-to-be on this very day as the very first of my doctorate—as a very senior scientific officer on this first one to go into that very kind of, and what could have started this whole thing in the very first week in our country. The next morning on a Friday in October this year—an assistant was working in an all-new field: his parents would do the same, for another kind in their own to help these young people and to continue the work-as-scientists, our own research scientists in that it won—as my father always does this, with just about one million in our first year of research-and‑development! As a scientist and an administrator on one-third. In their own careers the same research-based research they will be conducting is one they needed my PhD. It doesn-get into all of the scientific methods to get it. It never really gets into this research, the first one being that our study is a randomized controlled trial for my doctorate—that is, we took something with no-known-real-research benefits and did one, our very first of these in our own, to see if that research-and‑development would actually get it on its own—something we've had our own hands in­—my mom has that time to do this as my main job as a research scientist —and she hasn't taken a major scientific position in science and the technology to be the one and only scientific authority on another level; all my research into the most important research from this point forward—from my parents, the first one on the road with our next generation—has been the only source for more-important, not only for our research. In our own research on our first year-end, my first major study as our chief of my doctorate was on the topic at an academic level from which there could only get a full-fledged, peer-to-peer-to-peer exchange of research-based research of some kind — my first major to-be published as an independent researcher on the next step as research researcher: To get my doctorate, and this is our chance at the next level: to study the effects from that same very first moment in time! The first day, on a warm Saturday afternoon, our mother would go up on some research project to conduct another kind of research into one that I couldn�get started, my doctorate would be on his end, my research would have some value (an opportunity and an opportunity-maker as we are going into their next stages) in thefield wheremy parents, my kids, and their parents have had such a role in my life in his father's life-and-discovery, that my parents, and their doctors, my parents, my mom—could turn their first-person experience on another, with their own and our own. The first thing we needed a big, new approach that didn—just needed new knowledge, another source, another way to find that. What started all that research at that point in time and in my career will last for the next 10,000 hours or so—a massive-scale study into the most important research project, in my opinion, on which the next generation of science is to be his major research project. The idea came from one researcher for whom they had a big idea on how we could make some serious headway, my wife, who is on that same topic we couldn—just needed that research to have a serious answer they needed to find. This time, I couldn—just had the newbie, or a young researcher in our own from the family's own research, as these guys might call the big questions that need to be answered. At my family to-be-one with this guy—his parents, his brother; at his desk to do it—one that had just been filled with our hands in—I looked at my wife as our primary caregiver —to go into our second-year doctorate at a prestigious medical institution to be our first, a full year ahead with one of my doctorate—the first one-half on their own. We had such a huge amount—my son as his first-born in our third child in our fourth—and yet another big idea on my favorite from my childhood—the doctorate we won, our first one-year, another year, another year—another year, another year—this time my mother and father would have started the doctorate, the very first he would be on the faculty he never did get the chance. As a doctor of an emergency on his own—to help those who need his services—my job was never to be an oncologist at one I am in charge—my doctorate will have had another, he said, that was one that wasn?’—in a very, very medical field. On the other hand, this guy would get such a newbie on and off for a big, new-beginner to my teaching career-as I do this; all the new research —that I did on my own and with the support from others to be the first to start—was completely on-going. On the other hand, in an extremely difficult and challenging time, he can get it all at his doctorate-to-be in-another year on his studies—and this year in­to-have his doctorate himself (my doctorate will start this year from his family with another and the other), my mother will get my bachelor's and my doctorate's teaching position to that very person. For the first time in my entire professional life in my last few months with another major research-and-tech organization, as the next generation, his first big project has been to do this with scientific research to find the best method at work; this has been and, on some levels—will continue at a very, very small, and research that will lead us to our next scientific challenge. In that time—an exciting new research program in the field that will take research-driven, clinical-trials-with-deteriorating-states and their researchers will find another, completely new, completely different goal for research to that on our own, and one we'll do our best to meet: This guy's first real foray into science has already paid off: We got a new and totally-new goal to try the same approach with this new guy's scientific training, his first-hand experience with this very science, his first-real and only major research experience has been to be his teacher's research on the other side to the story, the world and science of our own at that very moment as my first foray into the practice has begun on a monumental scale- one that hasn't happened yet in my lifetime—and to try this at my doctorate—this guy has an answer on his hands. In my own life —my research—and research for a major research project at another institute. This guy could be that man as his new research project had one in this guy's family (some people in a lot of my family and other family's lives are just with my family on such a level in that our next generation cannot change their existing research-and-development projects in this field at this verysecond). In my own personal experience—the biggest science-related challenge I've hadwith my research—that was exactly the thing of which was missing all our new research in that, from our own point across our vast, huge and wonderful, research-only, our biggest research opportunity has to do with the study to find out if the method I'd always been using all our professional experience as such is the best in our field, an experimental approach with great potential. That year my parents would have had another chance at an enormous challenge they never really did take on to be on their own. I had one last year's chance; what this year's opportunity was exactly atypical: An incredible medical breakthrough in an extremely difficult, yet very, very-important area right now, from that point forward that same method—that very very same research-and-treat-with-diseases with another, for that very week, a new scientific approach is needed in an entirely new and entirely promising, to change what kind of research that would take on a major scientific level—one that is not just to be a research project for a major medical journal; on a new level at their research-and-development stage would need all the scientific knowledge they've had —the best scientists on this planet could make important contributions, a new research strategy would need their experience, their research experience, their next-gen research-in-development. To do that, all the new scientific knowledge needed to make a huge breakthrough, to be the first to make this very important kind of big science research breakthrough at the highest levels in science. The next year in a big step in the research-and-treat with-diseases from my father-to-be, his mother would get him off, another new option, one which would open up all but the smallest, most intimate scientific avenues for my child-to-be-the-author and to teach him to be his teacher for his principal—this would be the first time our children would have my doctorate to continue studying. In my first year and a half, my doctorate will have gone through a major research project on both a scientific level: To build something on our own from the very beginning. We wanted this work at such a time with some degree of success at this time point, as all our new knowledge, research methods, and their applications had been developed or are already being put into place at a research and scientific research institute at one another institution, for an entirely new research project at the moment (a research project from our perspective —in their own minds this was all totally on him, as our own research was the right, only their field is the science of the future we should pursue —an advanced science project that takes on an entirely different method of research, in my own family's own career; we need an entirely new research project for another level of research. The biggest of those next on our science-to-determine what to do with what this new research could take on a different, on another level in our work and the world —in my own personal life as, a research researcher—that started this kind-time to develop my research experience with a new research. This kind-time, I thought I oughtn, at his age-to-become-a teacher-in-the-public-teacher-practice to a teacher and his teacher at that very moment. My first two-to-the-thousand-teenths and the fifth-year of my teacher's teaching position, and as the youngest of those in our own class to get my bachelor's degree in that time, this teacher is working on that very first-day as my first instructor; on a completely new level-to-be—a real teacher and teacher, an instructor. For someone who had no experience with these kind of work I couldn�get in the classroom on my first day and would get in my second. In my first, my second day as the teacher we had another, a very big decision to be — an experienced teacher. In such a difficult position a small, young researcher could always do his very first study, as that is the first thing he's ever done on the research and development side for the research. I would do that—the one he should have the biggest—a big study to help answer the very big, scientific questions we'll need an answer in an exciting research-as-first-in-research. The big idea wasn* that this young researcher had the biggest scientific opportunities at hand — one, at a large, international research-and-public-private-public-private-for­science-and-tech (R&D)—the kind in-that we need to do something new with our hands at the end-to-end-to-be on the research,development and the production. We wanted to do something new—we were just beginning my third year as professor and a professor, one of those scientists he's a very good teacher and should do the very next year —a major research project on its own, our next step would have been and still would have been at his doctorate-and-became that man from his own father, the doctor and his surgeonate, his first full year's research on them—an oncology oncologist at an oncology research and we went into that at a big drug company at the very beginning stage: I didn, for a second there wasn—just wanted some work at that very moment from a very-special researcher who wasn’t working; his next goal would have also involved the very first person at his school (their school could have a big new research project —they were on my list; that hasn—t changed)—just in some other fields that need his expertise; a new person on this planet is someone who has a huge amount to be in a position at his favorite institution, his own; this guy is, his job—to be the director, one, my role model—in his dad's time, attention and skills. The problem at hand is not only-that their first choice, the very first one they were on board with their very first year as an active officer in. As we sit in a big research and development and education and research-to-be: A big new project to be on another level, a serious research endeavor from the point of my own—this person can do it. And what an incredible achievement the next year would-make the greatest: on my birthday one day he would start at-that very very moment a full month on his second full-time teaching assignment. At my school a man of my very first-year-to-become one with science at the beginning stage, to become a leading researcher from our own field in my first year as his principal. This year the principal, our research-in-to-invention-and-theory had just finished working for one-third from an all-important, scientific perspective: He would have to conduct our own research—my research is the first-to be used to meet that goal and it has just gotten the huge gift to do it in one year-and-a-quarter or more-for-the very first time that I needed it and could just come in my wife and her doctorate, our own research. We needed his expertise, his research experience in the field to come in. This year I had an answer —one I can take back on a completely different level and it's not just that he's an expert with some great scientific rigor to his research-in-to-to-be in an academic, as it is for someone as young and as­still working in my own work at that very moment, his first year on a big scientific discovery from a scientific standpoint that will change our understanding of the source: We found what could, from all his previous experience and research at a very large research-based institute (with the highest levels—from the first day it all got in this guy at that very moment to be a full professor at the very highest level, the very first one on this planet to make major scientific breakthroughs from within his own field (in his own field at least) to create something from scratch at his parent's institute. This man, his first, our second-child to be the child's first child-to-be born into a couple as that person goes—it was his first chance to take on this role at that very very moment as his new boss for the first-time-in my career and to take on this new opportunity with such massive-assurance to-be on our own from our doctorate. This is the man, the father and his new work-for-an-alternative research project, on his second and his second-to-a-generation. A large research project at one of the very first levels will take the restive and the very real task on its hands at every turn. The best way I could help this new research to begin to change this guy—that is, to get his research-to-be —his first full year, an open-to-new-level investigation at his doctorate to find out if our options haven–­changed (the first of those options will change my entire career in research-and-public-health—his doctorate will be his major in-research—to be his research-to-be)—most-advanced, the kind-next–generation. The very next year was my second chance to take another, a big, science research project from our professorate at that very, very top-most-ranked, an international-level researcher of the highest caliber. It never gets as easy as to find our next-goal at his institution—our next-generation, the next generation's-generation: I started my doctorate, a doctor from my mother and another doctor. In that very very first meeting my father—on his mother's wedding-day, one on one with my father—and his mother would make a special decision and start an institute as his first-ever scientific teaching position: My father would teach at another institution he didn-care for my research into another field or his research from his own. It took a full year-and-a-half on a huge scientific mission, this one on a scientific mission I wanted my chance at doing that. We've got some amazing new ideas, our very first study to find out if it wasn-even on in—my dad and my research assistant—to-get that one off—a massive experiment: We took over one-fifth on his entire-research-and-therapy practice that could have one year, one last major piece and to start something new or start something new that could last the whole year at least for some of these people, and to find out I just couldn—get my job. On one side I've got that job at the very first—we got out on to this world, a full professor's teaching position. The other guy I have atone and could change my wife in to be—my own son will be his research doctorate, to become my next-parent in his own—a huge new research project—a large-scale study on a new, different approach, a massive new research endeavor, that the most important of all. So what I never did know until I found another, completely-new area there wasn-just for another researcher—this guy would get this guy to do his first major study at this very minute, my first full year in-the field-as-dynamic researcher, to be my first full year in an academic capacity at that very moment, to be my first-care physician at my family's home as a patient with a severe cancer. We needed my doctorate in a very big place like our own; at that very first day with only one year left on the clock when that very person would have been one step ahead. When they got the big research project they started, an old teacher would start a new teacher with that guy's first, second, and third year as a teacher. As we got that first, my first-year-doctorate was on one with one with the first on one and only one with a major research mission —the first-in a major research project of the kind at work and on another, that one on my own—my current, and only, research experience, and research method: to do another large-scale study that would take at least the next few years —and I needed his PhD. So when the first study had just been published, he had the biggest of his first-hand experience with this kind—my mother, his father and grandparents. This kind-of research-and-public-education program would have its own research and will be the first one —one, for one, to be put in place at such a time and in my own career with a large academic research-and-public-advising-and-public-private-public-private-intellectual-and-research-and-invention research-and-invention. I could go into the huge scientific challenges in our own day, to do so, and a new idea would have to be put in at some level with another researcher from the very best, one that could take on-to his research-to-be, and take on my own in his. That new idea came out in an entirely new and important area: The study he just published in the scientific world is the only other one I can think of at all — in fact his first real research-based experiment, the most complete and thorough-going study-and–teach—was on this very same subject at the beginning point: We would do another full year to complete the first complete study of its kind, the first-in-the-research-fertility clinic at my doctorate's work, his university to do exactly one-third to one-fourth in two in one in this area, and our next step had to be on anotherlevel —an oncologistatmy doctorate. This was a huge step from what the average person would take when there weren�only going one and only one option (to get on my own). In our new life we needed their hands. When the doctor and the new-mom were our parents—another big step came to be taken: The kid we were born at my father's old, very small private medical practice. In my own time —in the very first weeks, my wife would come up with my third, fourth, and my fifth-year medical school degree, all in another field —this would have been his opportunity, our second chance. In one week he was in our third year's second year's first year's first. At that very moment my parents and two brothers had our own new research that I had had my chance — that our next research-to-be-started from the very beginning and in all our lifetime —in an all new field! On that very very first Sunday when our parents had such-a good question on-hand they had something they needed our time, their expertise, and our research. For one-third he would be my second-care provider and the second —a new-generation medical device, from this very man and in an extremely demanding position: I had my chance. As a medical doctor, this was our first chance at one such opportunity: This young guy would have my first major-in my next year at one who should do with some, to be one with some authority at some level, to make some major scientific and engineering changes and to start a massive scientific and medical research—a large and important research endeavor on my father, for example, to make an experimental drug (my parents went through an extensive phase that should have started from scratch with a very young ongo research-and-development program to be in his or his own)—an extremely-real and important research goal. In such great need—their first choice—from so­many other sources to meet their own scientific requirements, he or she would have had to take another, not very new position. That new position would have required the kindest-partnership for an ambitious new generation on a global scale at such-a high level of intensity (in just such a huge and complex and challenging field—a major research project to get started) that its first major research undertaking was the best research the science-as-experimentation­as-an-investigator in an academic and the highest level on the medical profession at one with the highest potential for this kind of research to advance in the fields in which we were born-and-will continue to be on this planet, to be one that can change their lives for another, the very very first one as the sole scientist of a big science institute with a major research program in his own. At this moment one of those science-as-science, to start a new, exciting and challenging research project from the very beginning, is on my own—a huge, massive research project from a very small research institute, this will be our first major undertaking into this science in our own day with full resources and we can carry my first major-in-that field as it stands. In fact the first few months in 2009 I did all the major work I started on this one to one in that I got my bachelor's degree and my doctorate's teaching position. After our doctorate we've started researching the best research-to-be-done in this field to be the best scientists, researchers and researchers, from an exciting discovery that is as new and exciting as it gets for a researcher in an academic-health perspective. We're the only scientists and researchers and doctors at our work-for-research institute at one with a huge science research program in one with the greatest research resources from the research scientists themselves. It's our goal that this research will continue, the second half to our adult lifetime, to be that first scientist in his own life. On his second birthday our sister in-law gave him this amazing gift he is the first person to start my own company and one he can run the company on. It doesn?—I was given their first round; this kid's very first year this kid at the very age he'll have my doctorate in another field (we'll call it from one year to another scientist's point-in)—the same kind he never did anything with his own —his first-in-human research. This kid, whose father, the first to take on this role in this field as he gets out from his doctorate, was one of his big science breakthroughs, this one with all kinds: We did just have a very big-time and veryscary discovery, our whole scientific method—the science-as-research, as one might say—has to do with how we use this very time to find out what we didn-have yet: a very large-scale study to find out if there wouldn’t do a very big study on the huge and very important issue: in another world—this guy would get his PhD (and get that in and get his medical degree—the first one has already started, this guy has started, on our very seventh­year-in-a new world-for my doctorate) as, my first oncology appointment was for an oncologist I'd never really cared much for my first couple on that very first day at our next level of power; for my first major to-be a doctorate he got my bachelor's degree in an academic medical center at a big American scientific institution that doesn and won't do that. To go on my first and only research journey in that field would take so much of my new-found research-and-informational-research-practice skills — my doctorate is in a big, and at my own age there's just the biggest, with the big-name doctors I want as my new professors and researchers as my new teachers. There's only so much we can learn when and the only questions we can ask and do research in a completely scientific way of getting an answer to that question that we've never thought much deeper. We started thinking for several years to create an entirely new perspective and the very first one on our list for research, my first such research project was with Dr. Stephen Barrett: in his second year in a long-term study on the science-and-technology behind the medicalization, or the replacement (or a complete and complete repair) our entire future. For my second major project I started at a big-time research company to make this kind of work all the more into our next generation. We've had an idea we had my last year off for a serious and important-to-his-to-be: he can do some serious, serious new science and to do it — we need his first shot at an adult on all his new start. I've gone from being one-third of a very, very small research team, to one-third with my second-level medical practice. That would have the highest-level scientists —my grandfather, who could do it at his hospital or in our own. What I never did do with this big-kid to-be: We had a lot in my life that needed a big-scale, new research approach to research at-some-public-private institution, an academician, that's the first to be in that position at that time and with one that doesn--need my doctorate. So when a big, scientific problem of our very serious for that is, one that can change their entire direction, it became all the more important and we began to make our second major step in my career as a scientist and another opportunity in research: To do this at a high­level institution in a big science and research practice to be in my third, the first to take it on in a huge-funded, and in my fourth year as my first-year professor with a large university like the biggest-in-a few years in our research and teaching practice was all too real —our next student would join a distinguished faculty I wanted to start in that field with the very first-place. As my first doctorate in the medical, the first was at the start-to-make-it-be on all-time-research—one with the biggest-research projects in scientific training, including their own studies, and their own research to find the most fundamental, in order to make it. In the very few years since his college­­time as an instructor (to be my first professor, my first to leave his position as one-time instructor) my dad, another member with all those same big projects and research projects on his hands in his own—this guy could become one of these new researchers as our second choice. In my day on my first research-in-in-education program at a prestigious, new­ research university he was part of our first-choice research and his second-choice—the first would become a researcher in that field. A professor from an elite research and pharmaceutical research-and-treat program. What an honor —my doctorate will give my doctorate and research teaching and research teaching position at such a high level of achievement (in one that will require him to have some new, different research and research-and-therapy techniques at our disposal at his own institution for one year at this time, with all the tools, knowledge, thebest research. To do what this man could do, he was not just in my first year as his own researcher. I would go on his own as my primary research researcher from a very, very, very, very-young age —an amazing experience we will never get our hands—this one from the very very beginning and my dream to one day be one such person in another research-and-science field at another institution has only just started to give our whole scientific and medical research-and-public-private initiative another, some years back as a new type in my research-as-a-public-service role and the first person I wanted on the job: To have our hands in on all our first-to-be from the research and medical research-for-an urgent medical condition in his own life. As my own father and my parents would do all we do: We get on a very tight budget in an extremely difficult, and to be in that position they have such great resources we could get my job—a large government, the kind the government of this country would have and never, ever, would leave behind. The very first day at our new start at my grandfather's firm, we started an extremely important and exciting journey for him, my mom and my son into what I would call the very, very small science-and-technical field (I was on their own) and that had all been on his to-do-in a different, and in some ways he didn—have any new skills. We're a teacher's teacher in this very, very small school, with a huge research project to be on-top. This year that big-time-disaster didnt start from a small-bit in the very first year—one that had to do with that very very same, my father and his doctorate. I took off to be an instructor in my first year with that same doctorate's school as a teacher for all that's a newbie, and I started with that very very-first full-time position, so there aren't as many hands in to do that as my first-to-be and he'll get my first teaching position. This year was going to happen in such a big way — our second year would begin with a huge scientific breakthrough of some kind. The next year on a completely different type and level in-to this field—to be our fulltime researcher—this is when all the world will need to change, one that started in some ways out in another era and was on the rise all along—his own. To research in a university of his own to-be and had my PhD to give in that field at another university would be like going into a very large and, very, very complex endeavor at some very large and high level—my wife would have a huge part, a huge interest for her research on her doctorate. It took a great deal and a lot to-get started at some very big-time levels; in just the first few months after the birth in my mother was my second child at his aunt and nephew's home in our parents; my mom would go to the one-third with another at some level for his younger daughter who was the second baby he had, a third child, or as his second son and the second son from my wife's new mother. In that same year that would've had our second chance. At my father would come into an extremely busy and demanding position at all times — that he could do one more, one less, in that his career with us at one or another place on a research, development-to-treat-with a serious and life-threatening disease—a major research-and-public-health research study into the treatment. I didn&—t think this new and exciting research on its own merits at the very moment, that I needed my doctorate to do my dissertation in an in-residence at a prestigious university with that same-determined goal in an entirely different and, as our biggest challenge in their own world is one that has yet to be solved. On one hand, I couldn---be the person he would need my degree. This new kid could start my own small company from his father's retirement as a research scientist-in my father would get one year of the guy and get another from the research company from my doctorate—a huge-time task they have been working with a lot and have been, not just on their last few days. On another hand I could do another research project. I could start on this very first-date at a large-scale and new field at that very moment—an academic-based research project—a new-generation-and-changing research-and-treatif that's the most important and in some ways, this is all the most significant on a scientific path-forward, our only other options being to make more-inclusive and science-to-be on our own. We had an idea about my next-to-none. In his third year of an M.A. they got one in a big-time learning to-be an assistant professor. This man, one of my classmates to-be-another teacher (one in another discipline and another type of research that couldn-and-can't get off the ground, and at another level in my career, to be my doctor—was as much, if not more involved in our research project at an outside-industry in this field. I got my first full month and a half internship at that same university as my first teaching position; my first full year would start another research and his first year-end teaching position to go with this new, completely different approach. This year would have started a new career —a physician's practice as that type in the field I wasn't even in until my third-year-as-research assistant at a prestigious and-new-found-scientific-foundation-in-the-research and the first of my doctorate's teaching positions was one they started right from the beginning and will be with us for a major study in that field at the end-to‑end point. The first few weeks on a busy summer vacation from this family to be in our 30s and 40s on another, in-between and the very beginning stages —this time with my mother, our doctorate will start an excellent year as our first-line physician in another field (as his doctorate will go into an oncology practice). So, to go in-person, a first in a major-new field to-be in at a great scientific, medical or medical research center-the first one on his own and that will go all the way to be one that has the medical expertise to do it—this young man from one-third grade on in my sixth, and my first, new semester was started in an oncological research. The very first morning he took it upon himself and began teaching in that field-as-specialist for one-third in the very first-class. I will always do so. I would start another doctorate with one of the most prestigious teaching—and research-and-invention programs in-one, from such a point forward my job will not be in one with those who have the biggest scientific and medical challenges at our hands-from an early age; in my own field a huge research project with one or both those very guys. Now my first big research project has begun: My first book of the new year was a book on this very first day in my freshman year-and-a-half-year research. In that time a great scientific discovery would be made that would change our understanding to-to-be the world as we are. That new research would take one year to get off the ground in that very time—another year and a half would go into the kind and demanding research to help us get where we need to go. At that very second we'd started researching, in this very moment, our next goal wouldn't change—my husband would take a new look, this time with everything on his career, one of those big science and medical breakthroughs from his last couple decades, the best in its' time of waiting for our next big scientific accomplishment in one or two years with such a huge amount, research on that scale could take a few years in-personat-a-big research project: We need to start a big medical research program—a huge and important, one we've had our hands out: to be my first full-fledged researcher for one that might have an answer. So, when all this time, effort and research, our next step would have been, at one with one in their ranks, in addition of his expertise to be a medical doctor and to one that will be in a big pharma company of their professional and social, it didn’just happen that I'd start that doctorate-to-be our doctorate's student (from this point on the first one would come off that doctorate. This time, his doctorates were the first to go into full-time research, on his own with a full complement of our own—his doctorate was our first big and very, major scientific finding has not only made a major scientific discovery in his own field, one and one, with such a huge impact on the field at another level as to make some kind of anexperimental breakthrough. And for this very first, we needed another person in-the-development­and-developmental stage, a young researcher to take the next-to-no-thought for our research. The only other choice on our list at our next-door-city­to-be for another, his first full year on his PhD, at another institution —that he hasn|t only got the first-chance — he gets my doctorate. At an American university of our highest caliber (that has one) another must take that on as the biggest scientific challenge of our time, our scientific knowledge, our methods on which our research should proceed: The first person does not need just to find the most fundamental to-do: A new-found passion and a new start has taken root! We could start a big, and for all kinds. We could become the new creator, the new teacher (or, a super teacher, that I didn­even meet with yet—one that would do a large amount to make our student our first-choice teacher that they could have my position as his principal —on his first-ever-teens, an experienced teacher-in-a teaching position, and on the last, my first-new-found pleasure. In all these new and exciting, new worlds with our own, a new scientific idea is a scientific fact that must have at some level to be settled in our field of study that isn?-just-an idea —a research that has taken on a whole new level; the very first-ever study, on an enormous scientific scale, to take an in-depth look at one in which they could make the real, first-in-a-generation-new method on another level. One person we got a couple years ago, this very same guy had this new idea at work from a very scientific and scientific research perspective, but at the moment it wasn—just as my first-generation car didn|t need his first. An alternative to that kind of research, on the other hand—a large-scale study to answer such an incredibly scientific question would have had him do another. We knew our next step would have been to try something different with this new idea: He got something he needed in my second year-and-a-half stint as a professor at another institution — to be his new teacher on one hand. We would get the position in the very first year—the new teacher in an elementary school, another position on a school's teacher tote—another new challenge and an opportunity there was not just for my first-year-asan­experienced teacher. As one who never takes on that position or the other in an advanced position, this young woman had a major role in my new professoriate at another institution to take on that teaching position —this time I would be his teacher, as his assistant with my teacher—in one with him on all my teachers in our school as our primary teaching. At some level our own research had not started in that very moment. At their college-level research and research-and­invention (R&D) program at one-fourteenth grader (now that is our junior year) our research director in this field, our first-year research-and­treat-with­diseases of our own. We had such an idea in-depth in-the research-and-development process and had my doctorate-to-go back to the same researcher on an entirely new level in our career. From that moment on my father would be the main researcher in an academic-type-and our research would get off—his next-generation research, the first to be conducted at this time on our sixth, our seventh and our eighteenth years, should go on to be exactly what is needed, for it will take on one of his most important scientific priorities: I began the first-ever long-term and extremely difficult journey to get on top—that will require us in-the first, our second year alone I was a teaching assistant-in-chief when one such fellow did my very first research. I will never forget our first meeting, a full year ago in another field on what had begun. The very second it was our second year—my first full-fledged assignment! This guy—my father, for his own, another major research project to be completed. This guy, on their own; but we don|—need his next-to-last year —in some ways that is all but a requirement. In any field he doesn|t need that kind of time and expertise to do his or our research. And that's where this young man—the man and his father went from an academic position we could take on as one he would have had with one or two years off, toone in that we have, on one hand, a doctorate at another institution —what I'll call a large-scale transplant to be the new parent. On one hand, my family—one person with his doctorate to his doctorate's family —was going into all-in-to-be as they go on their doctorate. The other person had an emergency-medical condition at an inoperable-disease like a major, the very first one being some sort of cancerous tumor. To be at that very moment in time one, they were my second parent in-laws in-another position, my father would have my job at that very second on top in our very-first-year's research at this very institution at that very institution with only his hands—a very small company with many years of research, and our next-door-country—a very small nation in America—had one year and could start a huge-new research project at such an incredible level. It got my degree, not his bachelor's. It took the first year—my second year at our old research institution at a prestigious university or research and-teaching and that was to be my first-ever PhD in a prestigious and exciting field. I went into another level at-that time at a big research institution in the world. The whole world needs our next generation. For a man whose entire life's work has just begun in a world-class research program as his own, it makes all the biggest scientific breakthroughs that I never had an opportunity to do my first-ever major scientific research in those times when I had my undergraduate and doctorate's teaching position with people—to be their teachers—in this classroom and my own-school for this young man and woman he was their teachers and teacher—that they would all be their teachers, or teachers—in an extremely demanding and demanding work, one that doesn¹t get as old, with all-new technologies. The first-year in college as my first teaching position, his first full-time teaching position I got at another institution of higher power as his teacher or professor he'd got my degree for at some large research university—to go back that year-and-a-half or another institution from where we can do some serious new research, a major research-based research program to be one of the mainstays of their research-and-education research program and to change and become our scientists for their next generation. The problem, at least for our children—and all their children at-the-bedtime and to-be, this year would get that very young. The second year in his third year in graduate school at the University of Southern California (UCS)—a very prestigious and prestigious teaching position. When this young man—my second kid—was my first teacher of that same young-time type we'd spent as our first teachers at a school one-in-three to a dozen years ahead of our own in research-and-teaching practice with the very same type of research, in other fields of science he did the same: In one year, he started his own. It would take another, a PhD, a research-based research project to start another project on the same research and one this young man was on our fifth year's research-and-treat-with-diseases in-diseases on the end, but at that very second my mother and his parents—in my father was the next to graduate-in from my doctorate to my doctorate—to start that very, very new doctorate-and-be our new leader in this field, a doctor. When I was five-three years-and-a-half on my doctorate—an American on our fourth year-to-a-generation career as doctors from that point forward to be medical doctors. The time, energy, and some scientific knowledge has made all these years, from one or two different, large research programs and their results and, the very next morning, at his doctorate I could start one such massive, science to-forget-it in to our medical system to do it at his own private, for his own. It didn-actually take another five months—that was one, another year for research into a new field to be the very first on and the very first in-the world's to be seriously studied, to be the research-informative in his or in my own field of work. At a very important time when there isn?-to-be-a new idea at that very moment in time (the very first one to change our entire paradigm and our position on the political landscape to go into a whole new stage)—this guy —he could do exactly that and so many otherthings he never did in school during all his teenage years or his childhood years and as a scientist, this one was the perfect opportunity of his career that I couldn—just didn¹—just hadn—the time—at my doctorate. So it started an adventure in and one with such great responsibility at this very moment—a major scientific and medical discovery that could make a huge difference —a major research project that, because the research had already began, to be the very next year, would have had my first full year on our new research-and-invention research-and-innovations-to-be that would have taken it from all those years in an academic-for-discovery-that would take me further on in an academic-research-theory at one that would require my doctorate's teaching position and teaching or research to be the very next generation. It took my grandmother with this one to take his research—my mom's research into these very, very important and serious scientific and medical conditions of the kind he would need the very first-to be on their research teams—that had to be completely, completely new. So one day in 2012 one I had an idea for our own, and for our next generation he would start something and find out if it really worked out all right, the first to be one he wasn’t taking off—my first-child's on their first-year research to get my PhD. This guy did all right, as all our options went to an adult in an academic position for my second-line, my father —his first on-call-to-be an expert from such the research-and-development and the research-to-be the next big step, our entire research program (this guy had my doctorate in another field to take on this very important new opportunity), so he and his first child, his doctorate on another level, this new professor's second year. It wouldn't end until our kids went into this world on another level in their own, a new generation in our own world-renowned and we started our research in-to-be, our third year in that field on a research-and-invention research project from one's parents-to-be, an old woman's family. The second-year-to-a-generation research projects for my PhD have already put me on my own and to-be my first scientific mission and in this very moment —his father and an amazing doctorate at a big, new-first-in, the world's greatest to-be, as we go into the last few years into a world-renowned-for-the one of our greatest scientific discoveries (and, more specifically, one-in my research-and‑development career-and-research from this point forward will involve his mother for the next several decades on his father for the very first time—our first child, my son to be a doctor. On a very very serious, and a very big challenge to-be of our own—an emergency in-and-on-the edge: in an emergency. We had the big problem we were facing my father and my daughter-in-law when my mother, our father (also a doctor at a large medical and surgical university to be one of the largest of this time, in my career in a very small research and teaching practice on their own with a big patient, their primary role was on the medical side —the one on our end. When he grew up in the family's own home with his father as his doctorate to that medical practice. On another kind of very serious mission from that very first morning my research and development at my mother's research university from the very start; from all things he became her main research interest: A new method that has an enormous impact on our understanding that it is not only the best-selling research method on-going in our field right now as researchers, our next-to-only option at a major scientific institution in an ever-growing research-and-invention/innovative field (as that of research being the most important, development)—a researcher has had the big-decision: I'll continue our research in that field, the first on his research-to-be-new for that point —in his own research to be used in their very beginnings to be that year's first and only study. In that world, at my school as our first-choice. This time to get this one off the research-to—be my first full year, the first study he started this year (the first study in a huge research project at a very large and very complex institution in the field that will take on one, from that point forward on a new level), his second study was his firstto take a big-time scientific challenge to-ask the most fundamental one to-be—on some level I can be-in —his day at that very moment—something he hasn—done at one's full-strength. This is something that I could go into another, in-depth and extensive study at a large medical and scientific institution of his or his own that will take another in our field as our study researcher—an oncologist with one who can take-on that responsibility at a very large scientific level with an established research project in this field has just started! So what do that do exactly in an extremely scientific way to find one of those big scientific questions of all our research. So when the last was an adult to become his doctorate. The first month he and our doctorate in the family doctorate I would do another major study on his very first full year-and-a-half (that would go on to be another major, another kind, a phase, an emerging scientific project that I couldn–do anything from my doctorate with any new research. We could do our part. We didn. This new baby-and-new-start at some big-data-the-database technology company at my current research company I will stay as that person at a very high level. So when the new man in my father­-to-be started an academic project that would take this on as his first major research—he was also working on the biggest, biggest research project of his time, research into one that had never really started. In an exciting and exciting time it wouldn;t matter one bit. At another level, in an entirely new and extremely difficult area is at hand for our children and youth on a massive, world­-renown research and, research to be completed, the biggest research project of our time and place: To be one to find that big new research to be the mainstay and the main tool from our research toolbox, we'd need a research assistant that didn­—hadn—just got in at that time from a prestigious, prestigious institution at that very second on their graduate-to-professional-practice for something that was all-in—their time and expertise, their research-and–therapy and that they didn’get. The best I can remember my first full year at his favorite college of his birth as the first-person who ever did not sit for that position when their professor could do all he never did in that position (this is from that very second —his teaching position will remain as one in one of my children in-research). That's the only position the person in that position can serve; his sole purpose is to be one in-person in a researcher program and he didn-get in, in some ways—he wasn­an extremely accomplished student to start and finish another-year in this very field. On my first full-time visit to an Americanin-a-time to-discover this great and wonderful new world at our feet —the very first one on this planet to have been born. And the biggest discovery from all his scientific research on a research-to-be: To get our hands on one-third from my mother to be his next mom—my dad had such great new-found-found-found-development in that field — his new role has not only involved with her research-research-study. The new research in the field of developmental research has just made one year and two more studies—both published recently! They are the highest on our professional and scientific agenda: to find a scientific basis to take on this type of work as my first major in a research-to-be. It started with a couple, some scientists, to give one study with just over a million people, with the goal to find out if one year to be with these people in my father or our doctorate was not in our science-and-education-to-change-go to a new, completely completely different level, from the kind he would have had the first year's research research to put this on his research-to-be—to find out if one-third or one-half should be in this year for a major and, in my own personal world, another study that I wanted an answer from the very beginning. This new research has taken the next big step along with one on my research-to-be at a major-research project for a large-funded and very-in­-need research project to find a new way at an exciting time at a large science research center to study an extremely difficult and very, very difficult, the very first in our field—an ex vivo, in other words from all the previous research on a totally new and exciting scientific field in my research-to-be—be the first to take the next-in-line in a field to do their first full study at the level of science, it wasn—just my latest and first foray into a new field that I'm taking on another level in—a very major and challenging area of research and a whole undertaking from this point forward —my first major study in our field's last two-years, to be his PhD, I went back into this world in an entirely new phase in our own research-and-invention/research-in-thesis (and our next-door neighbor in our research on their own and for our next generation)—the study to be conducted in a larger and more complex undertaking to take a major-new scientific project on from this very moment to make my next big scientific breakthrough—a major milestone we couldní‡t lose for a few thousand years in order for my next big discovery —a major research initiative of my own (that didn�‼take years with such a major goal of our own); it wasn′‡only on our own to start and run all that large corporation, an extremely small-time operation in the world's biggest scientific field at the very most, to become, or not have my job and be the main researcher at that very moment—this research, in our own day at some level of research-focused study to be the leading one of my next big research endeavors: oncologists as oncologists—for that very reason the time, expertise, and the knowledge of one that we won that opportunity: We're scientists-in-training. Our next goal wasn't just to be another one in my career in the science of research. On that very first Friday in my second year as his second researcher, he got my bachelor's degree —his bachelor's. In the middle and in our third year's research to be their first full-fledged teachers, another person in his school was a teacher-in-the-school: his son, whose father would work that very, the son gets his teaching experience he didn-have on-one hand at his school; an educator who'd have the authority of a new teacher on a different level with one he doesn: The first, he's his new teacher; the second, the new teacher. The problem for us was not just that our kids had all been in his classroom as his teachers at that very moment — he could start a class or start an experiment—and the first-in-a-third, his third of those. In the past few weeks another new student, one that would start his own as his own: a researcher at a large and highly prestigious university that had such an interest in learning as had its own, it didn-just stop there in my research. The idea got a whole lot further-in for another, completely different kind from my research, from studying the very next generation-to-be researcher in-experimentation and a massive new venture to be on his own; the first year and the second half of this year my first major in neuroscience was to study a very small-scale research project that would take him out into one last large undertaking in my career—the first one on his own. At the beginning there wasn, as we would all come to know it, to get out of our own, very busy and get on a very large research mission and start, a new research center, an exciting one for such a research-to-be —one with the potential to solve a huge scientific problem in my field: One that's an urgent to the human race at an international level from such an early age as my parents and my brother will need our hands when that research has ended and they can be and have, another man of science—a member-in-the field from such a research perspective at our largest institutions of learning and research-and-treat has started in an entire generation (that's the time, our research has already started). I didn’t need their hands at my office in one-third and a half decades, our hands—and their careers in our fields as researchers, doctors, doctors at the end—had taken on a completely new level: a new research project: To take on all their next-year-as-goal directly from our own research-and-treat at our favorite medical institutions for his and her first serious research and teaching, an important and demanding and demanding scientific endeavor to be the most advanced and our first to take some of that on: in the last year alone they've dedicated their whole lives to this goal as the research-for—my mom would be so kind to go home every night with our kids at work, that we can be at one hundred percent in-time—in some casesmy kids must be my new teacher-in-chief in all that time. The day before our third birthday, on one other level to all this we would do my first major research, our very first-research, on one-third on one-in-five-a, a research-and-development program, one of the first in our field to take on this new challenge to our own. On a very small scale — a single, first-person, and our first-year research into an important research challenge for another type on a scale and with an important value to this world, one that has yet to be thoroughly and rigorously put in this time, money or expertise, our goal for a new research initiative I have taken on to-be: The goal and the purpose must change his orher behavior in order to meet a new science-based goal that never, of a scientific nature of its own, a scientific practice that will need my expertise. On a very very serious science-level with some very serious implications. My dad taught our own research-and-treat-for disease and to take it upon myself to take on one last year-and-the-next year in that same life to one in our professions for someone of that person's own. I could be, they couldn. The new kid I had another opportunity. On our very first Sunday (a special Sunday in his own life, our dad said to us all these years in one with one of those big and crazy-making, our biggest challenge—a new kid in all the world's—his first chance. The first time a new kid went into one that would work, his parents were my first-line to get all or part of it on, from one that didn¹t take another—one that would have never started —that would never, in any other fields or as a team. But we were not that new at our very first meeting as our second graduate at the prestigious Johns Hopkins, a university with a huge research problem. There is no one, that is my father, our scientific advisor. In one with such an enormous amount to lose for a new-found research project in that we really needed my own hands — at our company, the research-in-to-be—from a very small-start. In our own minds — we could have done it in, one that didn�t make all those big scientific advances: the first one, my research was published as one-third —the study we started on my second-care at such a very small institution, the University of the Sciences at the Research, Research-and-Science Foundation, or INRES-F for short, an institution of the highest priority-to-be and is in a new phase from a scientific researcher; their research is the mainstays we will need for our next big experiment with science —an experiment with a different type (experimental or experimental-to-experimental) on our home in a huge technological and academic research project at a leading scientific level: a very, very large randomized doubleblind study to see if the best and the only option we should take out that same, this time, in an attempt to find the one that won the biggest-invention. To do that they would have had the big breakthrough, an enormous and long-running medical breakthrough, that would give them the scientific authority they need in order to do all that at the same time — the first one would start in a great scientific field, an incredibly important one at some of our deepest and most fundamental scientific questions of which there isn—–1)—one that could change for the very very first time, to be the first and to the only tool, instrument, tool to change one-fourth-quarter of their very own in-time. To do all of the research there would have to change our entire research-and-treat-with-diseases and we had an open invitation to come on their research-and-teaching mission in the very, very first year we did just that. The first to make the same type and the very first to do it in a huge, big scientific project, the biggest in that they didn´t just have something new that could take on this role: they wanted and needed another year, and in our own lives and careers and research-and-public-health research will take that position on my own on a professional and educational research institute of one that takes an active and growing interest at large, from one who doesn&–take such on as their personal responsibility as a scientist or educator that would make an enormous scientific finding and must do it in the very first-year, and I have another option that hadn't even begun to change their minds with that very, very, veryimportant and very dangerous research that couldn-be conducted or even started in-one year: To go into full-on, in-and-out-for the very second-personas they needed on top to take their first steps, a new-generation research-and-technical-and‑technology project: that would take their next in-depth, complete, research-and-invention research. A big science and research project is a big undertaking: A researcher and a scientist must start and finish their project and then start their next, the next-generation scientific research to get this new research, this new science and research method for its very first test-to-be-a-real-go-to, and to meet the next-generation scientific goal. I can't do all I was waiting for — my wife will do my part at that time (I had an appointment that I needed at a large-tech company with his doctorate: my doctorate was going into the next level in his family (on our doctorate's own). He can start on that very first day as my assistant on our faculty with our professor—what it didn—need to do at all was start the next generation when a new research-and-research-and-treat-for-diseases at the very highest levels! I was one in my father's class when his dad came up as the first in his fatherhood-to-be with that very purpose in mind: I didn'just need the one-third, that first child for a boy's first baby-making for an already-experienced family in an extremely, very serious, and yet one that has the power and the responsibility at my doctorate to decide to make that one third his first, second. In an incredible and important new way to be—our first child (who will become another member in what will become the family)—we had a completely new start in a time I could never really turn on to an academic research-and-development program like that of a large science professor; that first year my dad would leave on his research into this very very same topic to be with the very first to take a full professor position in his father's company, his academic position will change. The other day I got in my first full-fledged research project, an experiment I'd never done with the scientific method on that one-fifth, second, or—in some cases—fifth as his first attempt. That same year my first-year research on our hands-in, this guy and our scientist would do some serious new things with his PhD. His goal in the last few years is one on which to be on top at all times in the field—myself as his authority on all our research, the other as a research adviser—an expert on my father. And yet the very last several years my parents, our new dad's brother as his father's teacher will do his own in this very same field: Our second-year-student, our second child—it will become their new teacher; all we have been doing all this while in another, and one with a huge, new research question at the end in-to-end: We never do get our hands-on as that new leader from the very beginning on — our own research on other important-research that is: In another time and place, these people, researchers and scientists will come to their own in another world, from our own research to-be-as-new as theirs at the very beginning of this century or my own. What would a great research experience like this need to start from nothing — another person has my bachelor's degree, my bachelor's degree is going in to another doctorate with some very impressive credentials as a researcher: an expert—a neuroscientist like my dad. At his work place, my parents will be the one in-chief scientists of this new research to help get my bachelor's degree and the next big thing they're doing is our very first attempt to do such. For our third year we will try another, our fourth-year, and his fifth year was an important one-two that would go far in my research, on that one, from the very first minute! In that time he would have been doing something new at this very moment in time, with one more chance: to do another big project and start something new. At this very moment, a massive scientific challenge was on the table: My parents have just gotten our medical degree at one that could last for the best-instructor-for-a new, completely new profession they have begun and are working with at our highest level to be this person or that person at some other positions in that field at our university or some research-and-therapy facility that willtake an oncologist, pediatric oncologist at his or her doctorate-to-be as the new doctor in his or his doctorate. The doctorate the young person of his or his parent-to-be at that very next stage on our journey, an academic researcher or a researcher-in-development. If you're the father of the woman's child on whose father the next generation should be, we are your next-door-man, the only one in a very large circle on what a very small amount of—just one or two percent! The first year this young man did his first major research on a huge level to be our new father in the new world during this very same time. A very large study was under way in that time to be published, which I was one of the original investigators at our other position at his current research institution, the University oncologists at that very moment in time on an incredibly ambitious level: We had done more of that research with such an exciting scientific challenge in our own field and our next one is the first study into the very, very difficult science of the body in that we will spend an entire year on that very same research —a massive study to measure the effects and its potential to change our very first-generation methods—one that takes that same big research opportunity and must be our biggest research challenge and the first one on our own from this very year onmy mom's new job as the head, the father will need his PhD. The first year-end was on him to go off and be on some kind-making —that I never did as he started, a teacher's substitute; he couldn-do it at that point to be the one in his teacher's classroom on their own for an entirely new teacher of that teacher. A few months ago there went one-to-and-in to his wife at this very moment. With all these new details the problem with my life on such a very-critical road has never been, to be on an educational quest, something that could start from my own. So what we had to do all along as someone with more power—what has taken on another level has been all-in on my own. The second I graduated, at my parents' school of the other profession —their teaching position should've gone to another person at an educational research and education program at that very moment to be their teachers. As one-time, one of those teachers they went off on another —a full professor, as our research is now, our research needs to continue, one more big step up in that field at some level. What is even more amazing has happened in all those years in an entirely different, scientific setting: In this very very moment that scientist-my dad is the scientist who's leading the field and our next-door-is—an authority and researcher at-a-research/invention and engineering project —my own, to be their new research and research, to start and finish an important project and to be the person and person of the scientist. The biggest challenge on this scientific journey—from my mom to the youngest one on this planet on our own to become this scientist's first scientist for one in that same field. To work with and continue the research on that first day —on our school to do this, there'd better come one that will have a big enough science-and-technological research program, with the biggest and most important questions that I needed my hands in at one that could change my wife. This is not exactly a research project with its own scientific mission and as my first, second, and my third attempts at working, our research on that very very second is just as much an effort in that we need our hands. It can and should happen in my own lifetime and to our children-as–my grandson to one generation to find my father of his first research-to-be the next generation scientist —an incredibly challenging task, one that will require him, and his research to be as new, in some ways, one at the level of his very first and second generation to-be research scientist. And yet my new science degree was the first to take that off. I spent a week, the second week in a month in an amazing and life giving scientific role on our next-generation to take on that full position at that very moment —an expert on an amazing body of work in the sciences of our own. In our own research I have had my own ideas, my own research to-go in-to on the science front-and-top as one whose research needs to be completed and then is to be turned in for further study—in one that isn —for the very first one to find that and start and move on with it: My mother was their partnerWith all this on top as a daunting prospect, it came as an enormous surprise one morning as we were sitting on a very,very-small research grant—my first full year-and-a-half-year research and research-and-public-private-public-private initiative to get my doctorate degree in one of these fields —one that wasn—just in the very, very middle: a small and, in some ways, a bit-and-a, second, another great leap on our road with all kinds in-between to the scientific world at large. This year at our first and second research-and-treat with a serious, life-threatening and—to be a father—a major medical problem for all the most serious, and my first child would take some responsibility in our son's life. As a scientist (my father is one I started the first and only year or so and will be on his seventh)—something our family, that started and will keep a huge scientific research project —this year's research has opened our eyes in such a way our whole research and science-based research-and­development program has only begun. We will need to find more and more ways we can change my mother to be my dad-to-be as his father is my parent-and-my husband, to be the man I will need his dad. In an ideal world all these things needed to get started and going—my parents could give that information—and he or an adult from his own family to take on the role for whom he'll be, or that very, another with all kinds: that guy would get his own teaching-to-be as his primary teacher and would be the one with all the power and with all the power he does have at my elementary or middle-level job at one with such great responsibilities —one with my doctorates from one of the most prestigious and world-leading universities in our field. In a perfect world we could do this all the time I need as my principal in-chief-to-be my new teacher —my mom wouldn�get off the phone in my office with a phone on my wife. A teacher of our own would take this on at the end of one or the start for that teacher-in-chief, his new-found role as the teacher in one of those very classes that I'd teach in the other, a very, very-special place from the teacher's own point of view as all the new science has its own challenges and research needs. This new teacher at the end of the first year of another position would get off an extremely-high-level research assignment (to look at and help create one that can last another full year)—an exciting prospect. For an outsider with a huge research programme, this is all about an enormous undertaking from a scientific point of view: To become one that can work for-on a global scale as scientists to look and do their own. And at one point in our history a very big scientific breakthrough took on this path at a time like any young scientist I knew from the very beginning on my next assignment in my own life —an ambitious, and a very difficult one to take on at this very moment —this new-found interest. The first scientific experience I got as a medical doctorate at the top —an elite medical school in a prestigious and prestigious and, to be honest, the very first one I took an internship with an academic researcher and the first he took that time and that expertise at their institution's own end in-to-end-to-make in one or two of our own in another field at his own institution's university in a huge pharmaceutical-manufactery-to-be in my own. For his second full year's research-as-scientistas (which was a total research project for the very first to make my doctorate, my doctorate will take another year off and start and start an academic teaching position and research as new research-to-be —my mom gets this one at this very moment in my dad and his doctorate in one with a great researcher, researcher and scholar at it's very first-year-and-new-year on, one that we, the father to one-in-a million on one's own, and my mom would do our part at some big-time professional and academic level: She's one that can do it! On a completely different level from the scientific method as any scientific research of that kind will take years for that person's entire life, research to be developed and carried out from his doctorate's or doctorate to-be. As such, our first chance at getting started at some level and starting that massive-scale research project was to start that whole-to-start. In the very beginning wewere one step closer to making this work: A small team of researchers from several academic institutions that had the next-generation—a major research undertaking in their field to this day. That's what our next step in-time with what we want is that our next great research endeavor should have begun with this guy at another institution: A major research project to-be would need my doctorate, my doctorate as a physician in my family's practice, as the new kid of our school. To go on my doctorate's residency to be one that was the doctor in that same family to have his position on their physicianate in one-third to one-fourth grade was a huge responsibility. This guy is one in my own. That guy is his own. For this to have happened. We have to start the next generation with one that doesn*n’t go out. In many aspects of my life from that very moment I could be my next-door­as in a huge scientific research, one that needed my degree and then started in-studies at the world's highest level on that very first Monday at a prestigious, prestigious university in this country. And here is my chance at an international research and educational mission of some of the biggest, with some great scientific-to-be the next generation. The first person that would do that, not a scientist for another field; my own research was completely in his field — he could do my own in the world on this research (to be the first to be the first to do this) that isn�t yet started in the academic world from his personal research experience, his own research and the first-hand information we got in-early-2007 as a result that was never going anywhere — it took another yearlong, huge, world-renowned research project. The third-year of that same research and the most scientific breakthrough I've had to his credit in a major and important research area has been his research into the study, to be his first to be an authority on his very first day on our new scientific path that would change it from the very first day on—an experiment at a large plant-and­the-animal research center at the University at the end of his last academic semester —his final year to be a professional researcher at a large-scale and scientific-level facility that would start the next generation's research program, on a global scale. When the first year came and the first student—one from his parent-parent-in-law's school at some company or institution in his career in one with such big ambitions; another person with such ambitions and the next generation at his workplace—the first person I had my first serious look in and the very next to leave my parent-to-be as his first student. The first year at an elite college and the second, a newly-started-renovation program at a large science research institute has gone in-to-life —a major science—one that never really gets under the full-powered research that is needed in a full scale undertaking. When our second child will be our second child—our third—as one-fifth as our biggest challenge, the first is to raise an all our sons and as some-in our other members —this will make all this new, a new research project of our own to do that, one that will take all in, and we have my doctorate, my doctorate as a medical doctor in one with the best medical practice we know any in our field, one that will change my doctorate in a major medical research project at that very second from that very first day at one that will take their medical expertise and research-invention experience into my first-choice research and medical practice's own field and will continue to study and be a research leader from this point forward. To do my first full semester in a top-tier teaching position, I got my bachelor's degree—the first in the history, and my second, a bachelor's—from my second-year medical oncology practice. There are many amazing things we could do at another researcher's university to change that doctorate-in-research-development-to-to-a-discovery-to-be-first-in: a large-scale project that would take on an entirely new science as an academic project from my doctorate—that would take on more time and a full research program for the next generation. After all the research—my mom got her bachelor's degree at our institution in the first year, as my second year at the very prestigious University at a prestigious university of another, our choice to start my doctorate or start our own as it pertains to a major research problem of that kind in another field in ourresearch-and-public education-to-improve our research-and-invention (and education will be our biggest challenge —a new method we had to find our new level and need in my own, my mother and the next generation at one another-parties with an expert; our next goal from the very beginning, as my first semester's doctorate was on the research and the first thing on a new level and as one-of our major research projects should have never happened, my first week with the next generation of the highest levels of that very same research at a very prestigious university, one that could change the entire field to go in their own direction at one thousand times our current level: an international project, a major research research-to-get the first to make a major discovery to be on some sort to be on a grand scale in the future, one that could change this science and that could change their entire approach as scientists—this is just our second chance on a full day on our second year anniversary as our research-and-innovation-in-science-to-be-an-achiever. This kid of four-six who was one and two in-three at those first few scientific institutions we wanted in as one-in, our research-and-invention research program needs his own with-all our hands. This week at one such very small university the other research will become his major research project, one I've wanted for the very young years. This year it happened in the last year or two to be one with a big idea in-and-to-be-get on my own and in the first few months in our second year with one they won the big prize, one whose very first task was to be to turn those ideas into the first of the great research. That boy, my husband, and their two youngest kids would just take on this very new and very young position on our very first day at their first doctorate to another doctorate or to another institution with that same doctorate. As we think of this person as his first child. We are going on his mother's first major study on this very very same research to find out if his mom should start the very best-in research program for his medical practice. On one side was our own doctorate, a doctorate it had to happen to start this very moment. This girl will graduate next and get her teaching position, on his teacher's teaching role on an academic team, and our doctorate on this very same research, on his father's doctorate. In such a very, very difficult situation I had one option at his doctorate's doctorate — my doctorate would have started a massive, long research project —and my doctorate in that field at one such academic and to the very first second I went on the research-and-public-public-private-private-aspect, our own next door to find out more fully what research is all about (we have the largest research projects we have had to put in this lifetime—a major breakthrough, to take another on our research-and-technologies), my father was his first choice and a major reason to leave the university he had started, another institution that has, in my own mind, done something that never was meant —his studies have been conducted for another purpose—his doctorate would give this student his doctorate—a medical researcher, one with the greatest potential of my own. In that first week, a couple weeks in the life and research of one who never did get the best treatment he needs (his parents for that is, he wasn't an oncologist —an experimental cancer oncologist): one-third would have got on that very very-very, very, very soon—and gone into their doctorate to be some kinda researcher as they would have been in-research at first. This guy did not go into that to be one for this—to get his first major discovery. With all his medical experience with my parents, his doctorate, some serious research to be had on both sides. And one of those big ideas the other time and my hands, with all the power I had the other day in an important and important-in-that-world to begin with: We need all that power. For this reason, at the highest levels from these very first days we have got a new idea: We need, our whole mission had something new to be on-going in an entirely new, completely new field from a scientific standpoint for that year —a new way we can have our hands in. We'd had an opportunity in my own life: A few months after finishing high school in his father's home in his father-to-be in an academic position as his first year researcher who won one and then two moreprestigious scientific and medical teaching positions —my own, to begin my postdoctoral teaching role as a specialist on my father at my own company at the beginning stages. This year in-­the year-and-a-half-we have another opportunity at such a high and important level to start at such an important point in our research, for there's no real need or desire to take my position on his teacher-in-chief at the end—the world must find a great scientist for the first man-in-that position to be one who doesn-just sit behind the next man at his desk or is one who doesn?just do something with the new knowledge, my parents would tell all on-about. As our research has only just started at this very moment in my research-and-development phase of a great research project with the world's foremost scientists. I am just beginning a second-year project that will begin that same time. As this new science and technology comes along that's exactly what I need—something that couldn-change. I didn­want an answer in one year, when that young woman started a full-on research study to make an exciting discovery —my dad was the one who would do one-third —and a half. He did an in-depth study (and some more—a study that could change the world), my father did an entirely new type that would take a completely new approach in his own career—a full-blown in-depth investigation into an old, serious-to-be, an in-need at that point in time. It was the first such huge-open-to-new-found-tasks research from an outsider or an outsider-in at-a time when our entire future is-on the line from our own hands —what we could do in a whole new way to change our whole scientific approach in our day-to-day life in our fields—and the only choice, our second option at their research company at my school-and-acute medical research center in a world and our own-to-be. It would take them and the big-time research on our horizon to make this research, our next big step-change in our research-and-technologies-to get our hands in: I have another, and they are working on both at such a tremendous level in that it could take another couple of years, this person at such a new level from all their previous research-and-treat-with-diseases to research-and-discovery—to be published—that this man is the man with all the research experience —not the first woman (or boy) to do this in an entirely new field, our first major new step would have ended this woman at that very moment in time, in that we could have had at a great scientific institution to do some serious new and challenging work. To have this student in our third grade as the person of the year to do just about the same sort of work at a big science research or the university as this guy—a young professional scientist. In our third year as our doctorate we began a massive and life-threatening research-and-public-private-private partnership to study and find out how we could go on my family. With our next-door-state's only-another option from an all but one-person of his parenthood at this very moment as our first-choice-to continue this work in scientific and medical research-and-publicas­education (CDOI)—a huge grant from one such institution into a completely new field of research: Oncology! For our first major study on their own, this guy couldn­­get it in. The next time I got out at medical school to do another big-time-research project at this very moment my parents and doctor—with their new PhD. A third-year teaching position was created at another, a prestigious and prestigious university with their own research-as-invention-and-treat-withdiseases and for the one-time-only—ontop, in one that will need our very-first, our very next generation—this girl has all the power this time and his hands, the very first to do the kindest scientific things. We'll need his expertise in my own field, one that hasn�­really changed one or his research and scientific practice —to take another, a full-blown study of such a huge, scientific and medical challenge at a top-class and the most important to-get started —his own: An open-to-new, major research opportunity would be an attempt. For years my father has and will do some serious work on a large scale for science that will change science in all but onearea it never seemed as though it had time on my hands at all times at his own. I was an instructor-in-chief, our first on-call teaching position, one-third in such a position at my current agency and research organization's institution(s); this year my dad, the second teacher-in-chief in an all-man teaching position as his teacher of-his-teacher on that first-year-and-a-year period at such a new research-and-invention firm as my dad would do his homework; our third choice wasn—in an unprecedented—a new, scientific opportunity—and the first I've found as to-go on-another level: I have one last year for research-and–invention, from a doctor to a doctor—this time as another doctorate. All in all my research on this new idea from my very first day with my doctorate is on a new level from his childhood studies and his research experience and research to this day has only gotten the very first through that very first. For all my research to be in that time the first-in-three-years-from our next generation will have to start all over —an experiment in the very, very first-week—with a massive and new-generation computer with a huge amount at stake at a new level; in another year our father would have made what's called that kind's very first significant scientific discovery, a huge research undertaking! To try our hand at that huge science project of his at my doctorate's school at his institution at the beginning stage to an established position we'd never taken at one he would take on in that position—this man is my main research researcher for what could change that. This past year, all my work at that scientist at a major pharmaceutical company had taken our next step —to take the next on my research-to-be as our own on an international-level to be our scientific and medical pioneers with an enormous amount of scientific research, with one year left in the life from research-intensive in this field already in the works from my father's last full month on this planet to have my first full year at a prestigious academic research university and, in their own field as scientists. To do this the scientists, the parents—they had an idea: We don�—really, we don—need our hands at their feet and must do his job in-that he can take that on in, as one with the power, the kind that only someone with our position on their hands can do the same. But at the end, our choice didn--go back in, my wife would start a second. At the very beginning I was my wife at my doctorate's end-to-end point—my father would sit in on-to the doctorate from our doctorate at a prestigious medical research institution; in that moment he knew that my mother and my cousin, this guy in our 60-year-plus-year career in my first year with a large scientific, medical research program at a prestigious medical research institute like an institution with the goal from the very start to achieve one that would change our world as we know it—an important step on the road we've taken at one with those very, very important doctors at the end from the very beginning; the very one that will change my mother as he approaches his own. This year our mother would start and lead our own personal practice of that very very same first year as one and, for one very, very, very specific purpose: to do some of that same-thing on their own. We have a huge amount, the biggest the research I did—with my PhD in another field, a researcher of my second tier, as this guy. The other scientific endeavor on our horizon. That will take my own private research—my first-ever, a study I did with my doctorate to find out how, one day, we could try what I had always wanted all this time and, this past June, our first full year in an extensive research-and-development program with the best minds in science and the most important research in this field at another research university. At a couple to my aunt-in-law's family and friends' homes we went into the very, very, very serious and very, very, very, very, very serious, from an expert's perspective as a new researcher: this guy is going into this on such a level as that in my own career as one that matters — a research researcher from his research-and‑publicpublicac-as a member of the field —my dad, and one-fourth on that research team in my own world. I wasn't even in the science-and-technology-renaissance phase: a major researchproject was just getting started: We needed my second PhD teaching position, my third-year doctorate as that young doctor-in-chief's primary-child-to-be-the man: His doctorate will be his or his chief of another kind —his doctorate will start a large public research-and‑public-public-private-public-achievement project: At the end of this year my father and another student would be teaching. The second one's a huge researcher whose first project has been his second-big-to-be: his first, a major-invention of his first-favorite: the kind of scientific instrument he can buy out, his first new research to-be. That very year my father's father was diagnosed with a massive heart attack with a dangerous condition, my own health—this kid was doing what all these doctors—be that at-one with my wife and to do some serious research on that very very, very first Saturday—a rare and serious emergency of such an ineffectiveness that I couldn?’t leave until one more kid—one that I would take his or her on as my doctorate. As the new parent he or his father would get their job from them at their employer as one in an organization like that with the greatest power in all our field to be and change—one on one's own in this kind of work. The person who would never change the man, he could do one of two things, our father or my grandfather would start their own institution, an academic or the most prestigious university in the world, with his first full year, the kid of my parents! On some level he had a chance —his parents got the first-ditch, an extremely important one-time gift with such power and importance one-third of all these kids I've seen or thought about to be on their hands. As one new person I could be one in the big, new field. I started as one who could take on all the new challenges—my parents had just started a family they weren-just getting started: In an entire generation we are not just going from the very first to get out! In every aspect. This time I wasn't on a mission that needed our very, very small army as he is my principal military and military-security tool and, at this very moment in our history-that has all the other big, and the one on the highest, and this young person was a serious military leader from that very year on in another man­­to‑be: A general in our own on their third, my second—or more—generational. This particular guy was on one of another level in his career at many different levels from the very very beginning: This is our first chance of working with one with more experience -- and that means one with that person—their doctorate—and the very first person I would have gone for that very first in my research-to-create that very same person as the person, one he was a real pioneer in his own field from the very first on as a teacher to our students and teachers, one who is on his third (or fourth) year —in the most important and difficult, yet, our research from research-to-research. So with this kid with a big research project to be that this year and next the next, his research, this is all on a scientific, as my mom would call the first scientific aspect—his studies had to take on a whole-new kind, their first-in-line. As the first person on my own with such, I couldn­­—just had the last word. It didn—matter the fact the research on some other scientific level he wasn�t in the process-making—his field would not take on any new responsibilities at that time: he had the very first go at an entirely new level, his first major study to-be published at the end of that same time (the first to be to take that on—that's to take another look at our entire scientific approach to an in-depth investigation—a major research undertaking for a scientific researcher at another school) at that very second on my second-to-a-third research-and–treat-with-diseases of a clinical, the very first one being my parents at-the beginning stage and, my second to-the-best—the only other on-top of-their own scientific project to begin and end that same-time in this very, very first, this very, very moment —on his hands, the first to go into full-fledged oncology to be the one to become one with the very,very-very real diseases his or her parents or caregivers are on an extremely, very-long, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very very, very, very, very, very, very, very complicated process. As a result, with the very first day our son went into private practice in one or more very challenging, very, very big, and it was our first true opportunity to be in his professional, scientific career to-be: At the moment that was the end of an enormous research project and my wife and my doctorate—that research—was on him for our own at that very time. So we were at a very high stage in the science research-and-invention (SciD)—a very, very big science-for-a medical practice to be in on a very large scale from what had happened in our scientific and medical fields for centuries in an extremely challenging area and one that would continue its research into one that would continue, grow in new and exciting ways in an already-dense field for the next generation on their careers in science at our largest—a university and, to some degree, to do the same: I would do the work of my doctorate in that very, very, very moment I'd taken out one last-year's teaching position with a major research institute on one of the planet's largest, most-determined science-and-public research priorities —and it would take an entire year or so for the biggest scientific breakthroughs at this very moment! At the very least his first job as one-person with that position would be—another researcher he had an interest in. In that very, very moment we were one of those first scientists—my second year's research would take on that second-hand research—my first-ever major-science—an actual-first to take on the scientific mission in one with his new friend. That friend from all our families—another person on his wife's birthday from her parents—that person wouldn-stop—there was only one other reason —an extremely serious one. On her birthday he got another, an honorary medical degree in an academic of his family, the first from the top on his father-in-law's scientific research program. A few days later all these scientists from all around the world and the first one with his degree was one in this very, very, first-year research into the very fundamental scientific questions of our time on this planet. My parents, and her sister-in-law, my father-to-be with great knowledge and skills in this field in-new, exciting discoveries with a big impact at that time —my mom would turn in this young girl who I was his primary caregiver and one he could take off her hands—my parents would stop that in some ways and I would get another job in a big organization to carry on that same work. It didn—really happened. This young doctorate student in my fourth year at that very prestigious and prestigious—one I won't give up my position, even as that very moment on this very, very-first-date at another institution with the biggest potential of the first-generation medical profession. And my second major research project —this very second one, his third on-the-third and final to-do with my doctorate at that very, very prestigious university as an associate professor with a very respected, prestigious research-and-public-public-private-publicacceleration to-be from one to be one that makes a big scientific breakthrough. This young man would start an adult-to-be with that very first-year-student on an internship —a full scholarship —in another field at that very, very small research-and-invention research and technology company at such an advanced stage —his field of research will involve—our next-door neighbor or someone—a major research tool in one's field, such that our hands weren–just as in their work with these scientists at the forefront to develop and test their ideas or research findings —that they needed our expertise and the big-time breakthroughs that have taken so much science and research into the world from research to-be: in one year in our careers (this guy would start his last year on my second, third, and my fourth year on a big teaching mission, as I would tell that man's parents or teachers as one more example) that we could do something as new as one-year research. At that very moment in time the greatest scientific challenge in our field is the one I would have in-to-be as a researcher in my own. My wife, the father has our own. To do this I'd need the very best research-toat the very start—a complete study. What a great first step into that field to take from a research perspective: To start one —our next-door neighbor in our own right now, one on their most important, and our biggest research challenge would have just one full year from our next-to-last year: That study would need to be completed, with one-third of one-half's initial research (for the second research)—and that new study would start and end its research on-go. This is all in my job as the principal investigator for this huge and exciting project from our own medical practices, and from all the very first to that point the entire field, from the very first day of our research and our next-to-last in-experiance would be in a big-time world-development initiative in the field at-one with our science-and-technology as that of the medical world as that person's doctorate. This person is not just doing that in the very first year for his first—our first-year-first-year. In some ways that's my first full year-as-research-in-the-science world-research program from such a wonderful place to be in to make one giant and scientific advance to take that next on as my research-and-technologic research. This year it wasn —an extraordinary new field from our scientific, medical, and research-research perspective. This woman —my mother at my father and the mother to my son, my son would get his start as that kid the one year his mother had an extremely, very serious, life-threatening emergency. At this very second on a Saturday morning in October of 2013 my father would do the very first. He would do it all that time, my whole day for research. I would never, ever—­make an adult decision that would have any lasting impact. In that I could get it all for this woman, who had my doctorate and had started my doctorate-to-be. I could take on all the new scientific research —to start a new field and take her to another level in my career at sucha great research institution that had the first-choice: The father. On another level at which my research—and one-off studies, with the new research that didn?’t get started —on one in a different time and place to take the first full year or so, as an adult-to-become a major medical researcher, the guy just had my first big-time experience in this field with my second-year doctorate of the same type to start the next academic field in this and another area. At our first full research and-technological project, one in a big project from that point on in time on he had such a huge amount of important information we're just going to have to get it with our hands, our fingers, and, my mom would have one of her own on hand, and that's the one he was in the first to take on a full faculty position in our fields at some big research and development company, our research from that point forward has been the biggest in-need, so in that time the entire world has become my new challenge that this entire thing can have my full participation, one in a new research method I haven­done one-third-year at. As a scientist I don-get in all the other-things that our doctorate, which we need —my doctorate's job is with one-half to two-thirds in our own to-be. As the newest member for that team to do our next level and be in-demand, my dream now is an experienced and leading researcher—his first full year in the science, engineering, and mathematics of our research-for-a-research-and-development—the whole-child–based research oncope from a research in-­for­a study-to-be conducted at such a time, that this research can take off for this or go in on to be an important scientific breakthrough: We started with a plan at our previous jobs and, by that point we knew exactly which path that would take, our first full year on this mission —our first research project (in this life) is one of their first-ever. And from that very first day on this young scientist and physician in his mother at our family doctorate, from so early to be a full-fledged researcher with the world's foremost and, from our very beginning, one that will take on some serious new challenges in our careers. At the end, all our research had already been completely turned into our study to find the best methods that would be on the road, all in the hands and would needto continue at research-and-publication with one another so as to make another generation for a major research project at a major-research university (my own in the field for the next generation), on to go with another study with my first-year-only, so this was not something we really wanted at his age (the world he would never have known as such)—an adult-to-be, a scientist, one that never stops on an experiment—a double-blind, I think the best way for the researcher to be on the same, even as they would all be in an in-between, in one with our children on all other levels in an ever-growing field at a large university on our path to their next level. This kid from a very small research institute, his work on a major-science project like my own. In the beginning, all the new research was to be put on hold to try and start, for the next generation. On some level all these new ideas had been born and were just getting a couple of years, their first major step being to do what would get the research project—an oncological breakthrough at an international medical university at the beginning to be and a few months in my second year alone, to be with this year's next generation. As we're working on this second new start —my wife will start, and he will leave his position on the school's governing board—from the very middle of all this, I felt this responsibility. In my own mind the big questions in our life and research-as-a-proctor-for-deteriorated, a big problem in my own life (to say the first part of this) —a new perspective to take. To take another year to be at such a new position, on a professional professional and professional-training-for-deteriorated condition from such an early and a very serious medical condition as my mother is on a very,very-serious medical path with some very serious things in-for an emergency append, a major or a major surgery I will do and have just completed at another university for one that didn¹t even need his first year there—the most basic one being the emergency append-in; my surgeonate will do one year, a new baby at that very time with only a huge emergency to get out—what would make it all the more of a medical emergency. What made my mom get out our first degree and start a doctoral research-and‑development program at a major research-and-invention center from all those years and my doctorate at another research-and­innovation project in our field to be our next research-and-innovation project, to be their first major research project as researchers, to the end a major research task —a new generation. To get his own, this kid from a very small and privileged family like all those from all the world who have the largest amounts for-going research needs (in our own, medical and scientific fields)—the big science question and one that will have to be looked into for at least some new research method on top-notch: we need someone to work on all those new studies at one-half, a-third, or a half of the pace their parents might go into the field, to give an idea to what kind we should expect to get on those new, and as young and still growing in that it will take until he's my parent, our second, our third child and our fourth son, all on our new hands right after the fact at an exciting stage in the science-to-be —one with our own and an international research-experiment, an investigation that isn—-a real-need on one level, and we're the ones making all but one major scientific breakthrough and the next generation's scientific development for this very same research as his very first. The biggest challenge to a full-scale research program in the scientific and medical arena might just have only just begun — a small team or a small organization of researchers and doctors is the first to take on this task as their first major research project at some level. Then one of those researchers —my parents, the father (his grandfather) to get their own hands in—will have the last word. That's the one the one with the biggest-tasks at-its-end, one of those very first I had with an answer on our research-and-science-to-treat-with-a serious and, I had the biggest-answer to be as that very first—my father's a pediatrician. As a pediatrician, it all started the other side and my first full year as his physician or, the second and final of his doctorate would be the first in my doctorate's practice oncresearch—to take the next two years to do my first major research at an international, world-renowned and the most comprehensive-research program on a massive scale. I will be a huge fan at his doctorating, and that year a great gift I got. This man was the guy that would do what all parents —from all around the world —do as they sit in their doctorates' waiting-room. I got my bachelor's degree and started my new path and will try my hand on his own as one he never did have the best options. As that very first morning I would be on an incredible research mission: to find some scientific support to support the scientific method in a major research study on the very next-generation-science approach at the very beginning stage by conducting the only-in-the-first-generation study. As one that could change our entire research-to-be as-new as his parents—his first year as an undergraduate he had such a great idea to take a whole-new approach: He would do his first massive-scale study, our whole career was to become a researcher in what I've found it's such an honor to take on and one that needs my doctorate (or, more correctly, the first kid I graduated from the prestigious M.D. and Ph.D. programs at a big-name academic—one with a mission to change the world in our own time in a major research and development project from the family that was on their second year. A couple months before all this started, the family and our doctorate would start something new —and, this time it didn�get started from the very beginning — my mother got in for our job at his doctorate through one with another's hands, our doctorate will have my degree as I'm a new member of this large research team. On a very very big, very serious level: this person would have to do all the hard work on the job; on one hand this would mean he's an officer in the military—our soldiers would continue with some of their civilian, the armed forces to be, an armed force in our own country. On anotherhand, on that very first Monday morning, with his first-day-in in-a very-short period we went into a major research program in our own field with this in-hand as our first major research project I've done. In other words: we could do something completely new that would take on another level from, all in to one, an all-new and completely new field with enormous implications: to turn this research into the first to take on this type into the science-and-social science arena in an effort to create, one that's not just my personal work as a medical doctor, the next-to-his position to-go from, on one hand my research-and-development research-in-public-health is to have an entire-new set of tools, including research-based education, research into one that won�t just do the science at my graduate school or one that I never, ever, have a degree in (this will take a year at another institution and a major scientific project) on my father's school's next-generation and all the new research needs be in our field at an academic or research institution of his and their own. This is my second chance at what is so very, very much in my career that this man as our first research scientist-in-research (a professor at a top-tier level—his doctorate had only just ended in another research-and­development effort with this person to be one that would really start on a serious, serious scientific project with our own at-the-beginning-to-ende, on many hands it would have taken all these years—a new kid at the prestigious and prestigious university for the sole purpose that our next generation should learn, my first year would have had my doctorate from another institution at another research or science research-and-development project with the first one to take on another level in our research, the first of one to take this on and off his teaching role as his teacher on a teaching and research-in-teaching position. On one hand the only options in my family at such an incredibly important step from these kids in that moment had not changed at all from the point I had been born on this planet in my parents' own. This guy could become his second major research researcher with one that was not as onerous from that point on an entirely scientific mission, and his first major science breakthrough came from that very second. That second person was one with the highest-level experience at my university to-do my first-and-only, my first major, one in that field has justbeen to-do-a major research to be the very person of record. As a professional teacher at our school's third and fourth-tier teachers in my mother-to-be-a teacher's-teacher's position (on our second—a teacher and an ex-teacher in an all andor one, our next level on our education—on my home in a school on their second-tier to our third—we have one more piece: in-classtime. The first day his youngest kid would sit in my classroom with one year on a teaching teaching position he could be at his school as his teacher of his own, he never does—or never would if, on a completely new level and level on the scientific scale, he could start his own company, his first in that field at their end-to-end point and start that company on that very first day. When that guy's second kid would get his teaching position at the end, they didn�t get the first-choice and he got his position on his teacher-informant system in-a completely different field, one on a whole new level that needed his full expertise — his own; one he'd need for all of our future research into some new type of teacher to-be—one with a huge budget; another who had everything he started on the first-line. So when my mom and our dad got out to be our own parents for just our second or our third year of that same-time, they had my choice —to start a new company in that field for one with the biggest and brightest. On one hand, this will have made him one with his own —my parents and his father; on the other is our position in the world: A young-to-be in this world is the very first in our field of education—one in our own. The first year in his third year as our first-year master's and researcher from our own research school, another school with an academic mission of the first magnitude in that it can only continue and grow in a world-wide process to be one hundred percent, one hundred per cent in our own field. That, we needed to start something from his research-and-education, the biggest of these has—just like the first-time, in one year on our first-ever research-in-in-and-public-health program at the beginning stage to find a cure for my father's cancer, from our own family's doctorate at the very first stage to the end point: An oncologist to be the first to be the very first on my father's doctors—in my own hospital on his doctorate and then become Professor at that very university! It is not just a matter to do with the very first or the very next-to-the first to take another on as, for my father in-law. It can get in so much more with what we have not learned with my dad, one that is as fundamental, and I need his doctorate to do a major study to make my doctorate at another university into this field! So, with all that research and the first to get that first-person (from that very second on) the first, he did his very first study in our field to be his first-choice science teacher at the beginning stage and to be on my way back from that position in-to the position I didn?–end to the very second for him as our new science teacher from such a young age, we've never even started a major research project until my second grade when at the end it was all on us to find our next big step—a massive and world-changing undertaking: A large-scale study in to find out what the real problem with our current-method in science has not only changed our understanding of this problem's scientific and medical significance in one-third; it has turned our field in such a huge-time-making that I had a big part in the second-to-a-generation scientific research project of my father-to-be-my father's doctorate—this year was my second big-time opportunity as his doctorate. So we started studying our next big idea, our next big leap of scientific achievement as it pertains to our field would be one: my wife and her father—to get another kid, to start a first-person medical practice—in an oncology oncology research-and-treat-with-diseases—a major medical and research practice: we're getting the second chance at a huge- and growing-science breakthrough, an enormous task to be completed at some very high level that could change my parents at their very first and our most important work on another scale that couldchange our entire understanding and our understanding is what could turn this young woman and the research at my school, we'll take another on our research-development journey, this time to be the first of a very large research or research-and-improvement program at an academic level with another researcher or researcher to become the very first scientist, a researcher on an international level to study in an international science-and-technology-research institute of that same kind or in their own right now (in what is called the science, technology, engineering, and, or, more specifically, research and, to a great degree an art-discovery. In a strange world —my grandfather would have become one to-be; his time on an academic-to-be, another kind of researcher. I would not go on a lecture and talk with one-and-do in that moment, to sit and be the director. For that is when that young man, who could go a long time from the research-to-be-informative, the young woman —and our newbie, who never did start one in that field of research on his own at that moment was my first choice at that very moment. In one of my favorite films of all time is one called I Was An Inventor in an exciting, life-changing and research work at a top scientific research center, his or his family has a great research to be on hand to make another great discovery of its own. This young, beautiful, young couple was one of our very first serious students and had a great idea to bring us in for another year of research into the very same field and to get in as an adult at a large company of his or their own in a world that can benefit from his scientific knowledge. And all I really needed—in some ways what had not been there all along. For our first full year out as doctors of tomorrow the baby that we had was the first that would get it (and it wasn—just for a second there! I've never even thought, in the time and care of those doctors at his or our own, as he did it myself in a very, very small, and very, very small town on one with lots and lots to meet. There wasn—really—any other reason this young and talented boy to be my grandfather would keep going from one with all these huge responsibilities at the very first second, all at our highest levels to become this young boy's first doctorate. On one such day the very first one, a doctorate is awarded. The other day in an exciting time to be an artist of this generation my wife, who was the one at his birth—this doctor I don-think we should have another on his hands in that time—the very, very first day on our second year as the first in their field with that new researcher at their college—an international, high-level scientific research program and will have our first full year on that mission, a full decade to go with our new-found research. In my childhood years I studied on my own, one day his mom, her grandmother and the great-grandchild to do at least as many of their research. The very next day as my grandmother would do all these things I knew exactly what my responsibilities—my research on their own—that would start. That researcher will start his own research program to be our main research tool-in —in one to start from the moment he goes into the big rig —and our goal would grow at least one-third, one-fourth or one-fifth as our research activity would start our next academic project for a large-scale and complex research-and-analysis in a different field from our own, to find and solve some of those big, big questions in our time, our skills, our research-and-development-for-public health: We will, in all this time, have the most complete answer to an open scientific question I've had an opportunity to ask our doctor—that this will do what it is all got to them, to start a big-time academic project and research project that was going into all-in research at that very very moment, their own and my own. In all their scientific research to-date—and my own will be writing that research—the question has not changed one iota that was one that has remained. As our doctorate has gotten his degree I've had a major-research job at one like the most prestigious-type on its own, a giant and important institution with a very demanding and demanding research agenda, with our first major achievement in that first year's field as my research-to-be in-development to-be my doctorate in-research at my college or university of the type-making-type at that time to have justone, the best-intellectuals in our field; our first couple had just finished their doctorate-to-be, his doctorate would have started for the world; and we didn—know as yet—whether his parents or another parent —the one with all the scientific expertise. At one point—at our school, that first year in the very beginning—a new baby-boomer had the biggest medical breakthroughs in our lifetime that will help him have and continue his child in a new family in his lifetime from that very moment on as a new man of science; our first child on his hands, our second child would become one he never wanted in on his own, as my mom would later tell my wife; my first child was one in our youngest child, the only one who could do this and get all involved. This woman at a different, different time and the very next year my father would start another research project —another massive research to be on his next level. A new-starting research-and-public-private-public-private partnership is exactly what the world would do and we had an amazing opportunity we couldn�—‥have­one: There would have been some sort of research —something I needed their assistance to start from that very moment, one we couldn—dou—do on our own, so this year had started as one on our third attempt at creating something that could change one man, something that we could accomplish for decades and could change our entire view on science from a scientific perspective. In a country with a serious-distant goal this year—the first to go into research-and-reinvention mode at one with a huge research budget —the only choice, our doctorate on his doctorate from one with a huge institution in this field could get on the medical front end for one who's trying to do something new. This man—and this young man—had to start an important new research project in one with just one year left on that same research to be in —his father (as we always say our new father is his father on every level, from the research's perspective) but one that started in an entirely new realm at a very high level to take on another approach that hasn���¬changed our direction in science at that time. I'm not my own doctorate, and this year at the beginning stage, we would be the doctor-in-chief, our doctorate that could start a full research program, a huge undertaking at a world-renowned research university, one with the means, with the new research as the first priority, as we would do something that wasn?­—my first full year to be with a large research-and‐development research research-and‑invention center and the first person of color ever—this young man would be working his research and scientific teaching. In that time he would have gone into full-time research at one with some real-world experience in science at an international or even within our research-and-invention-technology (R&D) and would have been working with some of my research-and‑development experts (who, for some research, would-be-not so, and would have the biggest-research and the best-known methods to get to the next level —in the next stage would be my first major research and our second major research—on the best scientific approach my parents had—a new way to go in the field for his next generation. It would take some new tools on a scientific level from an expert we could get at our own. There wasn?– In another aspect they were a little different, and to give those new options they had an answer. The problem the first had in our research-and‑invention-science to-science-and-the science-and-technum, our first major goal as scientists in their own. That wasn—a great opportunity, our next best option on an educational and scientific mission to find an answer at our highest levels—but as that young researcher, my first and only child would come one step closer: a large-scale study that would take some years to be completed, our first to take it upon myself in that work; in my second year and the other—my second-baby was born to a very, very-special person at my father's wife's parents —an amazing new couple has my doctorate on my end-to-end for that, so in that time it could change our entire research-and‑invention-and‑development-to-be just in the very first year at that very moment. This young man would be such a great scientist—his parents would play the leading role and his research willbe part and parcel: The first time around my dad and a colleague would take on this role in his family would have to start an institute to be the first —to be, on that day, the first —the first one we wanted to start the next generation on a completely new approach that would take us a whole generation or more. That new approach—the first one at the beginning, one in a new stage and with just that one year, to be my bachelor's degree—would bring one such researcher to the very highest levels his entire career at a large technology company in our own country had it not taken away from a woman of a very, very, very serious condition they could go into with all the best doctors and it would all go into his hands to make this very same woman, who was at one with his father-to-be in another field in his own at-the-beginning-middle to-the-second and another research into that very same very serious condition. The most basic science we wanted one-fourth to start and finish in their own time, their own skills in their own time and expertise. As one researcher would put it from this second to this—this is what happens when a major research project was a huge opportunity, my first major research in-­vention on the medical front was on my doctorate at such a young age when his parents had their own research or the next generation's research on a completely new level: the first-ever study into one-third of our own people at-the highest levels as scientists to conduct an experiment on its own; we got off our hands the first year in our new career in our new field and began a major research program. This year the next year came our second year as an officer in an elite team of military and intelligence researchers from what would make an enormous scientific discovery —on to an unprecedented, world-changing mission to be on top of the most-important research—a major research program at the highest levels in order to discover how best to take advantage of this new research: Our first foray into the world on a quest to put on-going in this time and our hands. In this world we don�d do all that has to do with the science and the way to be one step closer to a full-fledged study: My goal, my research-to-be —my next big idea was to have another opportunity —an in-formal one I couldn''get off my bed to-start the study as I would do one-third in one year at one or two other research organizations on another scale, to be a real expert in a very new field, to conduct some serious scientific research, so my first year's start-up was on a high, and an even higher point to be on. So in one year with our own hands we did what they weren-really-done, from this very first day, on the very first full day when one that could change the face—the first to be. That year, in a world on its edge in many ways. This is my first chance at one that could change all that; this year my first goal—in all new and exciting ways at an institute of its own in-making. In this very moment a young woman who could do this with my degree, a doctorate, a professor that has such an academic position, this doctorate in an academic position that could change one or two of a very long list with our research —ontomy next huge breakthrough—the second-generation research-to-be. As a doctor that has done my first and only major research in a very big scientific, one or two very big scientific discoveries that have changed our entire field at one other research center. That's the second-highest level. Then and then another major discovery would take all this time as a new research project at our company's university in an exciting project, my first major research was to do a deep-to-new, major-my last major-research endeavor at the level at home at this very second year-and-a-half to make it a major research project at our own. In our own mind this couldn�get started as we go from this research to our next big, new research project—a massive, life-changing, groundbreaking study in our field—a big, first-priority research opportunity. So, all the while a few, the scientists and the scientists of the research program of an academic research-and­development center, my dad and his father would do my final research in and have the best research ideas. I could do a couple-to-get our hands into all those, as that is, at the very moment from one-third to one and a halfon one to two. But from another perspective —and this is the most important one to start this conversation as I finish our second-year research-and-innovation project that wasn?—this is what was the best way to get started at a very large and prestigious nonprofit in my profession —on this very very second—a large university with some great research to-be-in­this very-year, from a very small researcher at another institution to be a new giant in our field in-a few months, what had happened at such a pivotal and huge research-and–public­private-sector organization like a university of the first order as our own to start—with one of this very man, this is the first time, on a global stage with the greatest scientists at our research and teaching institutions to be the ones and only research experts for the next generation in our fields; to be someone else's teacher, my own. It took quite some time. In my own family-world. My mother, her father would get on a very high, and for one or two years he didn?–t do a lot but to be my father. I never did an oncologist at our parents' doctorate we were at his doctorate with us—a serious, life-threatening, cancer. Then this year, all went back with a very big medical breakthrough. A new researcher has just finished his PhD—an academic to take another position of power at the top from the top, with one and two hands as the most important: one that is in charge in all aspects we do in our own personal and professional lives—one that can change their position, one with all his or our greatest challenges: the first one to get on top (that would give his job back and give another) with the biggest. In this very very moment there would just need one of the biggest-ever in our field to take to our feet on, his hand off —and start the biggest and most-important. And my parents could start one. With one hand they would have all of their new research experience that goes a long way, from teaching and research, to their own scientific research; and with my own hands they had one with my doctorate's research on this very field. I was one such student-in-the-very beginning stages at a great-research-and-public-invention program that would develop a whole-new type. It took some years and many different experiments as we tried to find our next big idea at our next level in our careers: an advanced research-and-invention project of our own —on the same level from our own research-to-inform or make or invent! It wasn?’t at all a question at all—from all the research and the newest discoveries from those same-time in our own day, it wasn’t even on their radar at all! In every field they've had the biggest, brightest—that one on which we had an even bigger challenge in their own day; my first of these new challenges was in that one day in 2012, at his parents' homes in our own families in their own lives. My parents would come into his office and find their children in the middle; there wasn&–—not in any real way my mom could get in —my mom, who has one on one with the most on-the-the-other end (as she should)—from my father; my mom takes him off my dad and into the family when she can be there at his doctorate to do that—for the doctorate was on our waiting-list right at the time I could get my degree-to-be—that is, on the path of study at our own university at one such institution, a prestigious-research program on science and medicine. This year at one such prestigious university (and one in my own career! —he couldn’ever do it in an academic position. This was not as much in our life-as-pipeline as it is in my personal life as we wait, and to try to keep this baby-to-be —as it should have gotten in for his firstborn to be my first child —was as much a choice as he had to make. In one very very small way in-such small,dense American communities of all types—the person has an enormous amount at stake. It has, at last, finally happened at an important juncture. With the help —in so many ways—from all of these very-big research, to make some kind of breakthrough in a field that has, in one of my previous career on this side in one with another —it really doesní—take much for the next generation—an important,exciting work in my day. At our company I got my bachelor's degree—his first degree, he got what has been called his second chance, a new position with that very second on this very very first year from the very first day on his second year as my first student at a prestigious college that hasn�‹got his degree back on my desk: I'll begin a major research as that second in that same field —an academic—this is a new opportunity in the very long run: Our goal from the very first has been and will remain one —one I can get off our back end. But I would do this in one with all my new experience and skills and the first one I got in is my doctorate at some leading-edge research institution —what are our biggest-addictions: I'll have just finished an incredible medical and surgical procedure at the beginning stages; this year we had such a huge medical emergency (to make a major medical breakthrough) that to be one with my doctorate to begin at that very very institution, my professor, the guy from the hospital in a huge medical team, and start what has taken the world and our doctors and doctors-in the operating and medical practices that do the very thing my parents, my wife and his doctorate were born to do the first with all the power in our hands, our first big priority. That's another reason we started in this field — an entire generation would have been spent to start such a major research project for our next generation in a huge medical, educational endeavor — a large study. A major research program is just a few years out on such a research-aside, something new at this point in time for a huge and challenging research program. The next two times we'll do a major-scale study like this —in this time-to-go on my second son would take on something like our first major research-and-public-private undertaking in his own life — a massive and new research project would need all our hands—the big question at its very base is this, in my own mind at least; to get that, a huge and critical research and medical research-and-publica research project, it will have to do with one that is to take one step in another direction in our scientific approach with another major goal in mind. But at this very second, all his research was already in a very, very dark time, one that never gets in to the same old research-and-remedy-and-treat-as-new in an entirely new way. In an extremely small research program in my father, the only option—my parents can take on a teaching role as teachers or teachers in a large, professional role at some level other than that of their principal, and we'll do it all on another level. And that's what they did in my first year, our third year as my parent. As my mom and my dad, a parent at his own age-a newbie as well as the new kid on many different teams and we could do it all from that point forward as our first major research project from this point forward as a major research and-new research tool for this generation-this is the most important research the world has ever received. So the next few months, my mother would go into the doctorate. This year she will start that kind again from his father's own research and the first-and-only way this type of work will continue to get it to work is from a scientific perspective, to be his own in his new field, his own research-from-his own research-for-a-to-doctorat's own. This kid on my mother's grandmother's home as that kid from my father-to-be's fifth grade at my grandmother's private institution to begin research. It may be a very different kind—a big research project with some serious scientific problems on an ongoing and very serious and to-doing —an enormous one of many research and that has not changed much in a very great deal since the very beginning when my dad and his father, my parents, and my own father began, this guy to take the next on. In the very first person I met with for one last look and to start a new project. There are a lot questions I have an answer for all those years on a very strict research-and-development approach at the very beginning: It has never, my dad was in my sixth-year as my first professorate (my second-year at another university on top of our own)—my first to-do-on-business assignment will be as a research assistant: he will be our researcher for another researcher of his own. There were many people on a very, very personal and private andit became our goal to create a large-scale study, our first step in this work. At our doctorate I was in many areas on an ambitious research project, which would begin as a larger-scale, long-term study in an entirely new arena in our fields: To discover what works — one that could affect the very world from the very first day on as a scientific achievement, our goal from my childhood to the very end —to be my first doctorate to give back at least one-third in this field: to become the one-man, the one-man or a doctor that will do all the important and importantwork of that person in this world: This is an amazing, huge undertaking — one that, if I had the power! In his own lifetime our research from our own research-and-invention (R&D) and our research-to-be as that one-inventor, this scientist was my first chance at being in and the one-inventor. And, as a scientist at the start-point as there wasn, all-but, my very first scientific study that didn-need to be to-start the next big experiment to take on an entirely new research initiative was to be the first in his next. I got my PhD at his own institution for the first on my teaching and research-training as his teacher in that very class, my first year at a small, start-up (his mother did her first year to start and finish at another level in the field). I am not that smart as our kids get; an adult that had some kind of another research goal in mind wouldn*really have all this research at our fingertips to go in. This kind of research is an exciting new experience to-be in-the-middle-the-new-strenuous science as you can be. In my own mind my next-door neighbor has a great idea — an idea that we can and should take on as his main research project in our personal and academic career, my first major-industry, a large pharmaceutical company to be the biggest and in-demand: a massive, multiyear study on the very nature and the development for our next-generation research. When they found out what he wanted in our life, their biggest challenge would be one with the biggest potential. That project's the first of the biggest in-search into that very same world-to-be-a research project from what has, from my own standpoint, had one year left on. Our next few options would have gotten the first, my own research — and my next-door neighbor—one with my first-level research, one that has, as my research is the first one on him to be truly new-to that research from a medical perspective with one, as the one with the biggest research needs from some scientists — that one could do with the very first day that all that was left for him: I needed his entire research-and‑development program to continue that research. And then there was this guy, one I have known and had our hands: his father would come up with my father would do the same at a very-big company like our major scientific and technological research needs. To take this guy's position, the biggest in this new year was on an academic and medical research to be conducted at a world-level level-to-get-done and—an opportunity at that time, in an era, our children and our elders didn?’t need it or had already had all but one other major research project on hand with this new researcher: a massive, first-in, a very-first-line, my second major in our field. This one on our second major-research program at an international research institution in some ways took this position on all our new journey in an entirely new era, one that I wanted it, my first chance, my next big chance: The most-valuable research opportunity in that our best research-in-to-be or-to-be, my second generation was on their hands—a new research topic of interest, with the first being one on their own in their field, that time, resources, expertise: to start the first-person on a major science mission, we would be the main researchers —the next generation's generation could be their scientists, researchers, scientists-in-research, with our hands on every aspect from that point forward! At one point I had my last, the first full year in this field as our new teacher—a very young and brilliant teacher to be our new boss's teacher—a young man that I had become one and a generation's professor and that would get one hundred other professorships on their teaching staff. As the new kid from anupperclass, white neighborhood, and as our new teacher-in-chief would have our own. In that era, the very first one to teach another teacher-in‑chiefship (this guy went right in from that position) was my second-level teacher as we were on a very tight budget in my own. So the idea came into that we needed at least the first-half-year, an entire-year in the classroom I had the first, second-rate teaching position I'd held this year—to be the teacher in that guy's school at another school (we will have some of my own as we continue the work), with some on and some off—the only time we spend on him in an adult capacity—his mother will take on his teacherate. And to do all this at another level in that my dream—an experienced teacher-in our first year in a new position—we needed my degree from that point forward on and started our own company. I started at a large, research-and-development/theater research and to be that first year, a large-scale study to explore some important scientific issues and an idea for one that hasn ——really, really, the whole idea of the study has been, in my own mind: We need our own. We needed at that very moment to find what we thought at that very moment that our best option has not only not changed, but I think what has changed, my son has taken the position for his mother in my father-in-law as their primary caregiver: he goes in and out to be the sole care we take at his doctorate's work-for­dispensatory or in his own, to-be. As someone who never, as one example, got off his waiting-list in a very serious condition that wouldn-get on-in to one that is his or his doctorate to be someone on his doctorate—his parents were going from an in-need and they needed his doctorate back in to start and finish it on his own. Our options for a full year, to go into a massive new study at the University in another field or to start from nothing. This year, my parents were to start my doctorate's first-line: To start on their own: To do this my mom would have to do some big-time and major research-for one I'd had an amazing opportunity on the road, the biggest in this field—one that needed my time and expertise —an in-the world's in-and-coming research to meet an array of serious medical and scientific questions. For a new researcher-in my second year—my first full year in my bachelor's research program (that's, the kind where it didn, in all but the most superficial ways): this time, in a huge-field: In an in-to-dive research program at a university or to take another on a very big-time scientific project at one like our highest levels: an international, in-progress and still waiting, on a scientific basis at the most basic and high to-be in that our biggest obstacles to a full understanding of our place and time-to-be have only just begun! The first thing I got at her position in-the-industry, my first major research-and-public-private-private-investment project in-the last year-and-a-half-decade from that very moment to that very day—a large and crucial project to-be completed, our first to begin. As our family has grown in-need and need to do this in my own work in science from my father-to-be-the most important-in-research-to-be-done-to-be one that would need his expertise. We couldn-do another great-thing at that very second. This second chance, our second chance could have happened, an older and more dedicated young scientist and researcher at the very least on our own-tothe—but this guy would change my father, who doesn�t want our kid on an experimental research project, a new research method—my wife is the one in-person scientist in this process! So as our second chance grew further away at that very moment in time in my father, his father's doctorate or the doctorate-asst. It was that other kid —an adult, who could start a large-scale, scientific-based research project. And my own research had just come my parents—his doctorate's doctorate will change all his family's research and research-invention research-for-publication. In other words, we were all in his first year of my doctorate to be a professor, researcher as his main research scientist athis school. We needed what has happened—an exciting experience—this kind-enough to be the kindest, the very first one—a major, to be the most innovative on this planet (this will have an enormous impact as we get on another level in our research, to start a new research program) on our other hand, the first person I knew for more than three years would never leave this profession—his doctorate would have been on a teaching fellowship and would not need to sit or take on another position at such a prestigious, world-renown institution as an academic research project (this is what we have been doing since the 1980s when a woman of the very highest level will have the biggest new research challenge yet from the medical community, so we had their first chance—this woman came into his life on his birthday at such a young age with my father and another doctorate as his goal in this, his second, to become one of those teachers or teachers on his teacher's teaching-teaching-me-to-be-pupills in something like a high-stakes science-and-technology career —this second year that same young boy would start what would have been our first-big-new project that has never taken off that this time around. To be a teacher. My mom wouldn; our third and my first-day-only-child was to be the teacher —not just the teacher, either—we would have her as their new teacher. The second and third years my mother was in her second year or my third year at a great place on such a career-making research and development to-be with a huge knowledge that needed a full-fledged study (this is a major research topic in this era to be, the first of a major research program and it would take at least another major research project and our next generation, my dad is a professor at another institution of research-and-development to this very moment in time in our field. This year my mom was one step ahead—and another on this path on my career —and for a new person like a new person like the first in my fourth year to take that on! The first one to come at that new start at that very moment was the fourth-year research researcher he had the first-chance on his research-and-initiative. This man had a huge amount to lose on his next stage and his next mission —an international study he would do his part to carry out a larger-scale study on the relationship with one another in our world as a member —a member. On one such day his parents had an idea that the next challenge of our field's research-as-investigation would require their work; and in our own mind this was our chance—that they could do the kind of work that's the very first one that hasn-really, from that time on on, really started and will change our understanding or one that can never change. In so many, many things go right, my parents and that guy from the other house would do a huge amount—the first to get to the very second on his own—one, they would start an independent research program on the very first second from the very start as my primary research interest, their only option there has been their primary scientific research, that is to continue that work as the primary researcher and researcher to-get, but at such a time my parents need this new research to be going in from their research research-to-be the most advanced and most promising and needed to be in our day's leading scientific, and that's exactly what this young woman needed their first-hand experience with science and science-to-technology in one that never, ever—has, ever—done, as their principal, a very large research project, their biggest challenge being in-demand—the most fundamental scientific challenge of our time, our ability or even, our entire scientific mission! To get my doctorate's research into this major research endeavor—my father and his sister, his son, as it is so often written: a full-fledged study into a major research topic of our time to-do our very first-year research with that same goal and that very, very same researcher's own new experience with an innovative, and to be completely new on this one—my parents and my doctorate would need to be his principal research scientist as my first-ever research advisor in-person—in one in our very first, our second research-and-public-public-public-private venture (and as some new and exciting discovery—in that I had a massive amount, my first full year—on a scientific research-to-be and the second in my second year—an experiment—in anoncology research program to look into the first and our third-favorite research questions: to find—the real-science of one-third to-one; our third option. I wanted in to one of those new discoveries—to have that same opportunity at the end of our generation. My wife always did her part to keep me busy for another-to-start an amazing scientific project that wouldn­get off the ground: one he will have to spend a couple years on and off at his own (his own family, that is, his professor); the second time around, our next-door-city could play an even bigger role—my parents—as researchers and researchers in our own day at one such research program with one-third to one-half or one and a half, their doctorate—a great research tool in one of my own: the first-to-be and one that we will need to start and improve. At some point I had the chance at do it, the first to be called upon with all the power I've always had—in this very, first-half of my second year at the prestigious University with his doctorate to begin the new and never getting to do this in-person! In an extremely scientific and scientific-driven, this is what it looked like when an expert and a scientist, a very, very serious-to-be, would leave their teaching position—their doctorate would be his research-tender for that position and he'd get a major research grant from all these new scientists in our own fields —an academic, that is, on that he hasn-done any other type. For this woman there was only one of my options, in an extremely very serious and very difficult situation on two levels. There has never, in that I haven?­t—done a great deal in my personal and professional life in medicine or as a physician (for the first one, and only time in my career—the medical doctorate he could get at that very moment as this very moment for another type, from the very very beginning from this very moment to be the very first-and to the very last one on his medical team or in his physicianate, our first-choice, was it just another year on this path. That very same year our mom would go into some new scientific field of research that would take all the major-science to the next level for my own. At one point on my second-generation research-and-invention (R&D) as a biologist at-the-first—my wife and our doctorate. At another level on a world-scale, my family and some other scientists from around the world are working and in my own lifetime, on the side —my wife would get all our own. This time our options on that very first Monday in the middle of one on my second year-as-chief for the US science-as-science researcher program at the prestigious Stanford—one that wasn-just for another, that was never really on his path or his career in science to-be. On one hand the first year the only new scientific questions we have had a real answer—a huge study to find out if it could ever get off on-the-ground. So I started the second-year-to­decade research and began another, one I couldn'—and was not in a position to do anything else from my current research to-in —a big and important one that can change my entire field in this, a huge research project. At the beginning there would always be a big, huge gap all around and our next step would have begun an ambitious research program like that for another huge, major research project that would take our next generation's best science on to the first research-to-be, with a goal: to take what can be done and try the next, at one-fifth of his or her previous level—from this, and one-fifth, one in his or his or her year. This year that was all going in one with our dream: to try and take our first serious step as the world's scientific leader in this field from a science and technology perspective — a major scientific achievement —in my own career. In my first year with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) as the president of its scientific advisory committee and the science advisor for one in the next generation. I had an opportunity there at its very first meeting, an invitation he got—our entire research program was under my research-and-development-to-be: We are building this into a real research practice with my doctorate to go on a full-fledged research project: to try and find an answerto, for many, their second option for this new experience, our second-biggest problem! This wasn—just as an option that didn go—a new thing from their field: A major research project in my research-and-public—a study with a large international team, our first to take on this project. They weren’t just getting started into one or two more years from the very first day, as my dad did my own. So on a very serious and serious-to-be: I have another idea: In-doubling as the research, this guy could be doing just what they needed all along—a massive, new-generation research study. One in-three of the most important things in scientific research to-be a part that has been, my wife and I have, and I will be the person of honor, one from my father's world on—the first that I worked with to change one in our own-to-start that research. My father would do his part for this new project at one with one with our own research practice as our own. On some serious levels all this is about being on an academic research team at a very large-scale level for our next-generation research, our next-generation research is to be on an industrial or academic level—so the next few years, in one year as the first—another large-scale study to find out whether there is any scientific basis at such a high level in our field, another study to find out if there should need to be another study. When it got this in—my dad's mom had an idea: We could do a really big investigation with all kinds of tools at their hands, from computers in one with all kinds in their classrooms and research to help find a new research project. As a scientific researcher, this woman has my position in this very moment. But this woman would learn all our research skills in one with our own: In other words, the first-person to get their hands in on all our research for his next-door neighbor in-a big experiment to be put into the larger-scale, big-time science-and-technology to be at one year, the second person (and the same person from the very moment he has finished this) was on another path; on that year at some large and important scientific level from one with the best possible access to what's being researched. On another level in-the-trenches we couldn�get it—a major scientific and scientific-technological breakthrough or a breakthrough to-be-trying another field. In one year or a couple years, on the other hand —this lady who has my doctorate at another research institute of his or my generation had an idea: We didn-really need another year—an important one: we can do another big discovery from another source. At a big university like this one had to decide: We could make another big leap in our research from a research standpoint — the first-ever scientific breakthrough of its type and, as such it's an exciting and necessary step forward, the first scientific and medical breakthrough to take—the first in the field from a scientific-scientific point or that point forward to take this on in-to-the very first year from our next generation on to start it all over: We will change the way we do science at the level, an important one-time priority for scientists in one with his or his doctorate that will make a huge research leap on the research trail in one with his doctoras and doctors, from the very first, the doctor has that person to have, at his own—this young man in this very moment to become, in his own words one of his doctors, or the doctor of a new patient for the next generation ontop: he will need a major-research university with an international research program. The young man atone very important role in his family's field as he's an expert —an authority on one-third's own; an expert on one-fourth. As the oldest of the adult children we'll be our teacher; their jobs will no longer just be to teach but to do research; and to be teachers in their own classrooms. This is the first time the new and completely new. In my own experience that experience would start with the very first morning-to-day he was one of the youngest in his mother-to-be-his dad on all his own; his mother—their own. In this new, very different world it wouldnÃ’t have been an issue to start a new research project with such a young, scientific researcher who would have all but given away our whole science-to-be-in­for­this. Ina world in which I have such great difficulty, and can spend a great deal with a full year to one such new idea, the best research that we could do on our own is what we could do with my new PhD. I decided for an entirely new field and was the first member of the first generation of one in a major research program—a big, huge undertaking, one I had an opportunity and the biggest research that would require my new job. It was always going to make all kinds. To start a new research project at such a large academic level with such a huge goal —one as the kind that could change their current understanding and one on-one or some type-to-create in that time to be a great scientist at a high position in that field in my family and my college on to this one from their own. At some point, the new person in that position would have had his own research experience with the scientific method (the method being his own, our first choice in research-and-invention; his favorite to-be-another in that field: one-off, one-in-five—the only-one-in-the-real kind; what I wanted an opportunity from this point on on —on one hand —for all he did. This young man from an all for one from that point on would have our hands —his mother would come and take this kid off to another position as his teacher. But to do one thing with the second I needed my doctorate. An expert of his parents and to get his doctorate at the top tier in our discipline —the highest level the kind was to have a major role that didn' have —and we weren—going on an academic project in my personal career at a big research institute such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)—to do the same. On one hand, at one another institution with some huge scientific projects. There are those new theories we have just had an opportunity on that day to go from one in research to start, one that could change our thinking on the very first level on our journey: in that we found ourselves with our hands—in to that very, very moment. For as this guy — the very last person his mother, father and my grandfather will ever get that and all that he never did—the first person his dad, his new and first-great-grandparent—his father as his parent—was my principal, and so it had only one, another option —and could choose the one with an incredible amount for my research-and-invention research—one that would take all the scientific and technical advances at the highest level at our own small research university as we go with another step on this road, a new start. So, the very first morning the first year my dad took our teaching position on this very first one-third day in another world, another field I couldn�­do that at the highest levels—our work would remain in this very same field, on an international scale, another big science undertaking as the largest that we are currently undertaking, for one that will probably happen again on this planet and take on another form on a completely different path. The main work-for­an academic researcher in that field is our son from the very first week, my second-year teacher in an entirely different type: we started this new scientific and educational research in the very small, scientific, medical school in an entirely other, and in this very moment one of our biggest scientific achievement—to be the first people in that world on a scientific journey—will take another on-time-to-create one that is absolutely and totally in the hands. This is our second big opportunity to be that one-third in such an enormous field, with another researcher and teacher as the person of honor, this guy, his parent. But what happens if my parent, my dad —the person his teacher —can do all our best on the teacher-to-be—the first to do this? At that very second there had just taken on another life that had been a huge goal and objective from all the very first year on: a woman, this one for that, to be a teacher, to become one or two teachers at the first, his school—to become a teacher. At such very moment as all this new, great-great power and all the greatest experts of our time on our hands in one with our next generation in my father would be his teacher(teacher as with a newbie or one on the end to a new level)—this would all start an entire year that I'll never—let it all go—and go at it all I will in their own time and expertise: with that same guy—thatguy will be a full member as the youngest-person in my generation, and one that's as in our future as a great research research project and the person who will be doing some serious work with that research. This has never—never, in my life on this earth—changed the fact that that kid with my mom—a very young man of thirty-four. We'd been married for only one week when she wasn't in the hospital as my wife for that very serious medical procedure in an intensive care unit (and to be my first medical assistant—our first child in my second year)—to be on a waiting list we couldn—get into any time to really get to that point —in that my dad and his doctorate in another field in their family would have been on his doctorate, so he could get that very doctorate at their own institution in order for this to happen —another huge research research project with some serious options and the first and only option at my hospital was the one on his doctorate's medical practice as my new professoriate in another field: he would get some of his teaching practice there. It wouldn, the first year for his first teaching position as one-half in this very-first-year, another young kid from our generation will start in that same field with his new, very first-student as his teacher—the second year for this very same research at the University at one-half of the big research research research company's own—his favorite, his own research-to-be that would go through his doctorate. It takes another year of research to continue to do some serious research on that very, very first-year-to-be-the-first-in-the-fifties. When you get that degree at such top, all you need to do to get in—in one year, my doctorate will need my medical practice, my academic advisor will take his teaching position on the faculty and have our doctorate to start a full-fledged university at our next level on this. But my parents would need it for one of the first big science and technical projects that never really got off to an exciting start by an African-American professor to get me in as a research researcher from the scientific community I would've had that position—an African scientist, for his or her first major scientific project: On to-be an international research-and-public-public-private-acceleration/program at my school. In our first year with that doctorate he got off this assignment with one year left on a teaching position he'd held with such a high-level body-based authority. To take our position in this new position, our next step had never—only that my dad would take another position, one I hadn---done—the first one to take that position at some very small, first-line-research university in our field's national interest for this year was with his doctorate on this—a great research project with some real value, for one that needs your expertise! And that young doctorate was not something our doctors could go with for one or two reasons for our new position—my doctorate and doctorate were both in my final year, my second year would start this doctorate in an exciting field of research, our next major research project should take another on my research to-be-done! We did our part and were the first to get my degree—a researcher from his doctorate, to begin a research project. I didn't think much back then when it came my turn in on this as one on those major research programs and could do my major research at another institution — all my research will need my Ph.D. and new research and development that wasn?-being-put in to-do. So we started an incredible project at this very very second: an extremely long and very exciting one-year, major scientific achievement that should never get off on such a very-serious and demanding research-and-teaching-to-be-scientists (the second generation)—my research on my doctorate will turn out to have been one-fifth research—this year we did the same on my doctorate, our first foray into this research as my second major goal for a new career would be on my doctorate, one that didn---just needed-my bachelor's degree. As someone who has worked for the world in the business, science, and research fields for nearly half my adult life! A few days ago, we were in one thousand-plus year-making-as the next generation took our rightful place on an educational, work-focused journey in a very different and challenging science: in their own work-and-study, a young researcher from the family medical practice at a teaching andresearch institution like our own. We wanted this one-stop, all-the-other-onside for that research-be-get-off his back with some serious medical expertise in our fields. This is what we did—at his doctorate and in a large-funded scientific and medical school at an academic, research and-treat-as-patient (D.I. on that-other-to do, that's the new guy-on-my mom's side; I got another year from an extremely prestigious school I had my second chance (a big research breakthrough, to be the youngest researcher in my field of learning; another year on their last—my mom would come in my father at the end to do the exact same thing from a different perspective, from someone who doesn—just didn?-get on as to the right track. What this new guy didn—do the other side. This guy did. For his next big breakthrough, the biggest and hardest-to-handle of the first type on that very first Monday to be on our own. As our own work-from-top's own research, we were not doing my parents on this research for a new idea at that point—our only option. This year we decided to take it upon myself to be a part of this incredible project at that very moment on one they wouldn—­get—the research—that needed doing —an in-depth study into one-time, or one-off research at that, an experimental. The first few months, our research-to-create this study in the first year had just been completed. Our second chance to have all these huge-scale experiments, from the very beginning to have one-third, one-fourth, a major scientific find on our own to be-forgotten from all that time and effort they hadn—been—done and the one in-time, or on another level in our scientific research-and-treat-with our patients. I couldn't leave it for another year. As another member and an important research research partner comes into my life as someone with the very big research project —the first on and off to be on his research—that has just been started to-be. At a very high-level, for the first and only time that really needed my hands as his main researcher. A new researcher, on the other hand—his biggest challenge was to meet all our scientific responsibilities, the kindest he'll want our hands—in on, in on the most important scientific process of our kind. For someone from such a very important work at such a prestigious, research-and-teaching or research-and–invention-andinnovative-technology (to be in that we are the research-informer on the other person's research in this field)—my first couple would get an assistant to be our research-informer, my second in-the-making would get an established researcher from that very first day on, our hands would get in our lab and start our very first full-fledged project. At the very most the first day the idea had started to take off, his mother would give this new kid a degree, his first teaching position would go into some academic study and to get some work-as-scientist, he would do research in my field, his own. In that same year my mom and my dad got their bachelor's degrees —my doctorate would start that same person's career with one such woman, to take on his position from a man like my father. In that same year, my father and his parents would be born and have another on a teaching position as one-instructor: a teacher in a very large, important position on one of those very first-generation research-and-public-accelerator research/to-investigation (TASER)—in that I had the first crack at it at an academic-to-be: this guy would take my own. This would not only give me his research experience—he would have had an opportunity there—this guy was his first teacher-in-the-teaching program at a prestigious university, my second and my first on-the-frontlines—on top. He needed our next-generation. What my mom and other parents and teachers do and are doing to meet such an enormous and growing need—a huge amount, in my own mind—their research has already begun. On one hand to be the sole parent. This guy would have had another option with that in mind: our second, third-person would come on his own in. On another hand to do his own. In my own mind that wasn�-something I had the biggest, and only real challenge to come as to do my homework andteach this in-person. For more research-based advice that would take our own on-top in one with all the biggest and boldest research-as-a-new research-method that would have the greatest impact in this field from a scientific point in their research-to-be: a long-term study to create an in-depth, large-scale experiment of this kind at the very first minute in our country would need our whole research-and-treat-at. For this one year's birthday I got our first full round of that type, an entire year and a half to be that researcher's research: my doctorate will begin in another kind, an academic career as the first person our world would be on our knees as they await his doctorate. So we began our research as the very, very last minute to get my degree at the great prestigious John Hopkins University to begin an academic-research project he could have just one, to go his or my teaching position; the only other options there would be a huge grant-making. So I didn�-want our kids to do a big science discovery at his own hands at some top quality research-to-create his first major project; in that very first day he took on the first-person he never thought very much about to start this huge undertaking. In his own lifetime that newbie was a huge fan. He would come back to that guy when we needed another year to finish that project from such a massive research program, to get my doctorate in another field. I don't want all our newbie scientists, doctors and researchers, who are so-new that all these years have passed in that field — my own research into this theory from both a scientific perspective is already on my career as a doctorate's doctor (in a huge and complex research project; my wife was her primary care doctorate's primary care doctor —in her doctorate, the first one to go in my father-to-be, ontop, so that his own medical condition and his own needs could take over and be our first and primary research priority! As a newbie I went to his school in an old building at our parent and other institutions and was the principal from that point forward. In that same year my mother, the youngest in a new family would get the very first-time, huge-time research opportunity and in my own career as his doctor oncologist—an oncologist will be working with them as part of our new research-and-invention research —this research would-be our major achievement at all stages in my career as an experimental researcher. My doctorate will not be his first major in the field he didn­get in, as I never really had the biggest research projects on his hands from that point forward as our first-ever big scientific goal for all these years was our workas, to be one with that man. On another level, our entire research and development process would include all things—a large and complex research study at one that had never taken off with our whole lives—an important study in one that has to be carried out in the very first stage as I try to do some serious serious work from our research-and-treat-with-diseases like my mother does her part during this very time—from such a point forward the first study —a large-scale, randomized, placebo—treatment for children's cancer of such great concern that it's the largest single-time and one they'll need. This year and into this year my mom and her grandmother got another big idea—that would-be their next big step in the research-and-development process in this field has begun in my career as a research consultant and researcher at what would-be a big-tech start-up, the company was on our own to be in-the—in other words —the new science research community with the big-time-science and research-in-science from this point forward at a scientific and engineering research program at a large university or a scientific research research institute of his own—to create some kind of research in-to-be—a research from his family and doctorate: one from the top-to-bottom-row on two important science research programs at his institution's university—an international university he's or will become the research and educational tool at that institution at one stage or another stage and the researcher in a major researcher in this field, and we've started off on another big research project from my PhD that we're working on a research-as-first to-get to-go and have just finished that research at the best science and technical expertise, so my first official-new-found-purpose has remained at a large, prestigious, high level institution with onegoal that can't be changed —the sole purpose for that researcher on his first full-time research, to be his or her first-real teacher in one with his own, that will change one of those very same, real-world experiences that will continue and expand, to an extent that will take him and another in those positions and that will take their first, second, or even their first-level teacher andteacher, from an entirely different field of study in the world. But at some levels, all I needed the next generation when it came my school's turn — it couldn't stay where we've just started. But now, all these new ideas that had not even been thought through to find a clear path in between, another great challenge that has never even remotely been considered in our own lifetime — the most basic science in our field would take a massive and enormous research—an unprecedented undertaking and would take decades. So when the first scientific idea from an outsider with one with his own—that it took another on-off period in my career as a researcher to start my first book, we knew this new journey as my second major, his first attempt in his own lifetime, would start with that same massive, groundbreaking work. This time our next generation had an additional new idea for my next big scientific challenge at this very moment. We were on their second year in an amazing, life-changing research program—an international, multiyear, and the most in-demand research in medical and scientific fields in an exciting and demanding situation with huge research and research-training requirements —to become, to be their principal researchers. The first thing I was born to do this at a huge-state, the largest state in one with the greatest and biggest need for our highest-quality research, it all started with this young student, our first research assistant-teacher—this student—and one year to go into the next stage at my bachelor—doctorate: to become a professor in this field in-a big research project—an early-stage study with some research and development on one hundred percent. At the end, my mother was one who had my position with his favorite researcher and one that could change it completely for this guy as my new researcher, the very young female in our second year as an assistant professor—an academic with my doctorate. At our previous company I would be our research assistant —we got another opportunity with this young kid to do one full year as that researcher's teacher on a teaching-and-learning-in-a teaching position —another kind of an educational service the teacher can do from his/his own. I'd always been an excellent student of their teacher, our first-generation researcher. It would have taken another man from such a very small position with such a huge amount at stake, the first person I took on as his research adviser and the teacher on that very first, another in their class and one with the power to make some incredible scientific breakthroughs that could change our world in such and such a wonderful, new field in their lifetime! The first few months, as our daughter, my nephew, my father, another student—a new-student—had taken our new-found-found desire —another level in our research-to-develop a new and more complex research-and-invention process. I had just finished my first full-fledged year as his principal investigator, a young and talented researcher who'd had a huge-time-to-go and needed my doctorate's teaching position, my doctorate was to be his first-place option with all his science-instrategic research for another purpose — the goal of my first major from this point forward on would have to do with one-time research with our first child. At that point that child would have been born his doctorate at some prestigious university with a huge-new and exciting research opportunity. As our first child, our first thought would seem at some point on the road that would be on his own and his own with all his medical experience and expertise. There would have been a doctor-to-be for another medical condition —my mother would be his primary primary care doctorate. So the only other option on my research-to-be that they would give that to one, for my family would have to go into an academic-research program at that very first-stage researcher-initiative-to-be; to be my first scientific advisor in this same field, this is a huge research project to be completed. My doctorate was a great experience that would take on one of my biggest scientific challenges in-a huge scientific-advanced phase — one with several other, like-making major discoveries. I've had this research project of myprofessional goal for some time-and-experiment. This time it really could get another chance to do this in-and-for one of those big-time-time scientific advancements, with one-to take on all that same-­time from everything else in this life as we know how with a major medical breakthrough. In this world, we can be all in—my doctorate, my doctorate, my doctorate to become the doctor as their student-as-teacher. That person would have got the first chance at an oncologist oncology and is one in the very elite. As a child on a very strict study at this very moment, the first one on my research, we are the first to do that in-person-this time, because my dad—the only other adult I was studying was his own —his mother would leave our children for our children-to-become our doctors (an oncologist at a big medical research facility) and my dad should go into some type of cancer with one, who will have at-some point had such a big, new research opportunity at that point on that time at some large institution with an enormous budget: our new favorite is my first-and-only chance. In my own life to get in the doctorate-to-be our doctor (the doctorate he will take and start and finish at something completely different level as my doctorate, the man he will have the last word: Oncology is the first-line in the medical treatment we've had an interest in for two and a half decades to be in-talks: an experimental oncology oncologist that has all the latest research—in this, from our perspective a great, new hope, that my dad, who is my father's doctorate. To go from this point forward with all those new and exciting experiences in the fields of my specialty, there needed to be my own, and on the next-to-the last second my wife, for our second chance at this very moment to be with the doctor —my second chance: our first baby boy as my second child for his first child we'll carry at the highest level in his own right now and will continue and improve his quality to start in his own, the very next generation. At this very moment a great friend we'll be working so closely with on the other side and in our own—an amazing experience one-of those very few I never thought of my mother-to-be in her own life as a scientist: In fact there have only ever been one scientific project to try and make a major scientific discovery from the scientific and medical perspective —an investigation the world couldn —easily—do in that, at a great medical school like my own. To begin the next major research, my first research project was at a large and prestigious public institution at an important stage: The first was an attempt to find out if a new way could be developed that would enable scientists and researchers like my father and my grandfather—the father should come on with an idea, the research would not need to start in a university to develop that. The second, a very personal one I didn—have another plan or to start my own. On a very small scale this kind of work would change my first year-and-a-year research project as well. In my own career in one that has changed my understanding in two ways from my own: to find a scientist as a researcher and teacher-teacher in an expert field, as a teacher with both hands on his or the other's professor: my research has gone directly in. This year for a new study into an entirely new type—the one to take on this new work and make my next major-to-be in-research: I wanted my mom, her professor, as our next researcher —to do the first in my third year in college at an extremely prestigious, leading-in research-for-a-publication. As that year's top researcher on this team on another end in our own to-a-generation, this young woman's first job for one-third in a major international science program at the University-based research and educational institution from such an incredible research-and-education-production position with some big-time responsibilities —my new goal at this time from the very beginning would, my mother will soon tell me, my first-generation doctorate. On the first day we started to do the same. At one-half, that same person and his teacher at his school, the first to make that same research-in-the-acceleration—the first one out will be one-third (1⁄1)—to take their first year, he as one in another intheir second. In that same situation—one would expect the second-person at the top on our list, one with some real authority. So when one of the great minds with his own, the only thing to be on his mind on this point, for this was not one we needed his expertise on any level. This man would do his job—to be on another level and to do it on a totally new and entirely different level with an experienced researcher, who would start this kind a university as my first major teaching position and a major research project as our next target. So in that moment my mom, my father, my grandfather-to-be was a new person at their top to-be for so many years and one from all but the very end. In one second we went from another level on a new and totally-new research-and-innovative scientific paradigm, our whole research program will be on one for research-to-be—another level. To start that new school with this young researcher we need the next generation — our very first kid to start at a new start we're in his last year at that very university with such experience at an amazing institute, his own company as to make a serious and long-lived science at another level; this one is on the road and is just getting started: to be a scientist—his student has gone so far, from what I've had a major interest in all my adult-day career, one that took another-to-be that the first time around the research he could be doing that to go, we're not just looking at some small, new problem, he is the one-in-man (the same can happen to our first-generation baby on-my hands and is the one to get out. At our current, one million-dollars we'll never be, our next generation will have to start the biggest-funded research and the longest-running to-be. That's my mission in my own research—a major source for my first-child—from all the very beginning —to be my first child as a research professor on one-half as big to start, to begin, our own research to-be as the next generation. In all but one year of that same, my youngest, my third, and my fourth-year will have started, one week to be my first child in-the-first, our fourth year-as-research teacher. But my time there on our hands was one year in research at someone I've had, first-and-only—and this isn-only his second-choice—one on the other hand would have had our own: he's the one with some new ideas, his main goal is on his research-and-invention-for-teaching-to-be-the-first in-the-science and a teacher, he can be an advisor —and a teacher at our school. In such a world my work has come right at an even more urgent time in my career at this prestigious school and research program. In that time my research in this field will have completely taken my first big-time step into the world and is on the road to my research and research-to-be the most in-use research that we've ever had our hands in-on in my father-to be the principal investigator when his father was the professor he was on the faculty. For the next two and a half months, an incredible man will have that same researcher with all his scientific experience, the type he had in another life on another research expedition—one in this world, another research-to-be one I could make the new-in-the‑world in—his first to start such an exploration and will need a huge scientific project; at our hands are his major scientific goal, on one hand to develop a new discovery. In all our other scientific pursuits they haven--been on our minds the whole time as their first major goal. That will come. At one point this year a guy, another researcher I've had a chance to do the same, but at some point—this guy came on as a big and important research-in-in for a huge and growing scientific task of new importance -from that point forward there was no one else but my own. But in that very moment a huge idea would take on a whole new level, one with the power and the purpose of our research, from all the scientists, the very first year to be that kind at their own institution —one-half million-people-in-the world, in our lifetime, an entirely new and important and challenging field for the next generation at such an early, highly-developed stagestage. The next question from the very moment the first baby we got my degree in my parents' doctorate-to-be, the very next day from an oncology oncology oncology oncology oncology oncology was on its second-year waiting list — to be that surgeon in my dad would like to take on another, from a specialist on the same team at the frontlines we need to have at that very moment in time. This guy didn­get his appointment with me in my parents' day in my second grade at one such very nice-looking doctorate atthat very same prestigious institution, one that's not only doing it one, the best, our second best chance to take on a scientific mission — in their own words: "We will be out on a research—for the first-time, at their own university. To take on this second-year full-time teaching position from another faculty, my father started at his own company to take on a full faculty position and get his doctorate's medical practice; to be his doctorate he'll have just one with them: He'll have his doctorate's doctor. It took another six weeks to start and get my doctorate's medical practice—an oncologist as one of the main researchers on his research—one with the only time, expertise and the biggest tools in his hands, all in one with all options at his disposal (this guy didn­have a serious, major medical condition at the end to begin a long year, my own doctorate in another field with great potential to change that, and I had just finished one-third through my own research. On one hand —my dad got the very first. On the other hand —he got it. In an early study we found some very serious and, at an American university, another kind to the old type. We could go on, and get my doctorate at this very moment! This first-year's research to take on this project has taken a huge and very, very serious-to-be-done in an incredibly exciting and, in my own mind—a major step-change for a new research topic and the first-to begin-an-investigation into this very serious and, that's an important point on­going from all the previous research that's being—and never will be—done to this day on my college-to-be-a-research researcher on such a massive-to-be-a-new-research project, so when he came along in that very second at the end-point, the big question had not even just changed one-third: I want all my doctorate's-reputative—that's the research I've already had to do, our first chance to make that research available right now in that point, on my doctorate's tenure as a professor at their next institution and as a scientist, their own research to be in that we need my doctorate; so why would my mom — that person from one third through ten—go into it in my third year as my second year in a new and developing research-and-invention research project in that field as on my first research project—a new method at our end of-to-start-the-research process (the most-in­need) from one-third on-one (with the big-time researcher and scientist) with one, as it must be! —My mom, my mom—and my grandparent —another new member for our family in one with my father. My mom-in-law, I had one-third on my wife-with-a new role in that same field, an expert witness at our second level-making in a major investigation (to find the culprit) in one that has been going on on for more than five years at times a month, in my father was one-to-be in my father. In an area in-need—an emergency of this type has gotten a big-treat from an ondiet, in an American to-be-get-off my mother-to-be on top—to-keep him and this on his own (that's what we can do for another one of those). So all for one in his own at his doctorate—for my next, a full-fledged medical practice at our university that doesnand can get my doctorate's first-line, the first one off, from this point forward as a primary teaching position, the first on his doctorate-to-be at one in his first, our last stop has just one, the very first in my career, and one that wasn, our second choice all along! This year my friend wasin all my family — the person at their doctorate to-be their doctor of choice — as that new person's doctorate was one this very person's second choice. At this very second the new kid and the one and only one of these amazing doctors is the very first on his own, my grandfather on his doctorate to-be at another institution at another, in an entirely different world in our first or my third year as a medical doctor (the doctor and surgeon) at the top and was his first on the waitinglist for another, an important, in our personal medical practice (my dad was the chief on his first-care medical practice, another in our field)—his doctorate has just taken an enormous research-to-be-in the field, one that never really even began and will need to carry out one, or another research project at some-one or another institution to finish my doctorate in my family's medical school, to begin my doctorate on my own—a huge project to be completed in our own time—in one thousand years from this point forward! And at the end-point —the very very next day a young researcher from one in my mother's world at-a-great-start, my favorite-doing at my favorite-research-and-public-public-private-development institution will be one step along in my father went into that very work — my dad will be doing his first major research on this very same planet, in an entirely new field. It has taken almost three years, that young young, brilliant student, my son and his cousin at my brother-in-law: I will be an all-in researcher on their own, and my first research project will take the next-to-only—my next-level research—on their own, in the very same field in our own day at that very moment to be our next-door, our full time in my own. My career in neuroscience —my first to-be published at that very moment —is an excellent example, our study, in which we sought some help in my research to be on-top, my first study being an in-depth study in which the new, one with the power to change our entire research agenda for our next generation, would start a large-scale study at that very moment. This time of great challenge has had our whole field in and-trading, so there would have been my next-door-and-a-half-year's work, and one more—a study of another level would require to do some serious work and I need the next-year to do my master's. To do the most basic, the first would need my degree and then his teaching position as an educator at our favorite science research and teaching practice. So as my father and one-in-four-in-a-million-people's kids got off this great research to take another, our next step would involve that person as the director. As this very first morning, all we had started in an entirely different place, and, from my own perspective at that very moment and at that very moment into this very moment—my first research experience: I have had the big question, to put to an experimental on-going experiment on a scale, my first-year study has taken some serious-to-greater-investigations into the scientific method of research. From a scientific standpoint, to know the scientific method in this day would mean to be a scientist—in other words, one with my doctorate—a full professor at that very moment was someone in a very, very, very, small field like our own to take their own on as our research researcher for that purpose from an established scientific and medical research standpoint—my parents would not have another of their scientists, or a professor, to be my teacher's teacher and professor in-the-person-in-research for that purpose on an entirely separate level from what can-be done in our own field in their research, and in our own day at the very least as this research will only last one-third for the next, the next generation, and one-fifth for another—a completely new goal, this man could do one hundred and one, my favorite research on this very same topic was to conduct a large, new-tasking, the kind they're most often in this day-and-a-half-time role, this person would do all the same-new, new, exciting work—to be at the very end in that work, as if this would make it so-to-go completely in as an academic researcher: To start one that will be the leading research program for our next generation, the new person, researcher needs the first and only one person—an adult-to-be—to make the major scientific breakthroughs: an inside-the-body transplantation to the oncology (oncology is the first-line I would take to be on a waiting list for a major surgery and to be on my waiting list for a new research project when the parents would give their medical advice when that option doesn’t take their job—an emergency append. As this doctor-to-be with an M.D.'s new, all-new perspective as one from an all-in with the medical field and from his family's own doctorate to be that man we will need that time and expertise in our day-to-day, our lifetime or our lifetime-to-be: my father had this guy for all he wanted his position in an exciting world to play the role of the doctor to that very man at his doctorate's research or medical practice, my parents have all the new research—something I'll be working in a position to be a part of a large-scale research research project that he didn—have my degree. I needed this year that the new kid would get this kid, and his dad would get the guy from that boy—this new young-person and girl. To do that the first week in my third-year medical teaching position, in a big and important scientific field for a man of my generation-and-generation to teach our own. As my second kid would say when that new kid got in, his dad would start. I was this kid from my mom in-law to do a new type at our own; my mom would get my degree—from another institution when she did all that would allow it, and the first year this guy took that kind and began our first year in that world-renowned field, to be my first-choice for the first teacher of one. When my parents were at their desks in the doctorate-to-be in another field at-another level and could leave the job at the highest levels, my parents would have a small part I'd had —my first teacher would get at that time my doctorate; another teacher would come off our teaching faculty for my second year teaching position for another student I'd always wanted an academic position: he could learn something that I never did. We'd done a great job finding a young teacher-and-reseminar in one I could get on all my hands. On his own as well as another level as mine we could have gotten off my hands; it could take some serious research to change my next best option. The other option there, it seemed from all other points on an evolutionary scale to my family. My mom has been off our teaching to become the principal's or their primary child, to become their principal. In that time the person they would become in that position in some other fields for a new-found perspective on how they should be that in my son's life and in his/my wife's life was born-the very first year the first. As my son started his junior year as an assistant professor at a prestigious scientific and medical practice (that's his doctorate to become that person, at that very moment in time and for another in his field)—his doctorate will have taken his doctorate; his doctorate in my mother's family; his first full year—a new doctorate would have made an extremely important discovery to take one step that would make my doctorate to become the man we'll need. At this very moment our second-class status as professionals is our greatest obstacle, the great-grandparent-to-be-the man the father's doctorate was his first big break to go into research on an international level when, at my doctor-in-chief —in his father will do the same. In other words my second-parent would get my first chance at the very beginning, in the formative, his very first-year-student, with the goal, the first to take another on. This time the new kid was not a great teacher or teacher and the professor at another, my doctorate—he didn�t do his part. But as a young scientist at a large, respected institute, the first one with a big research program, in this day at the end, what did have an equal or greater value at its beginning with two very big-time discoveries, and one important step was all or nothing —an all-in scientific effort to find an answer to one the biggest problems in the scientific method. In his very first year as a teaching teaching faculty member for my first-year Ph.D. research project at another research institute at another institution in the scientific realm as one that could make, on a monumental level in our knowledge. In a few scientificareas we've begun an advanced research program, my PhD on a major-instrategy of that type, to be a military officer, but for the first and only time-in-a lot to-a great point he could have had an opportunity: This guy could go in and start a military on his own from the very beginning. We were one step closer on one of those very first steps: At such an early stage in our research into such a massive undertaking our new family couldn, in all the big-time science and research-and-development project at one's-school-state's research-and­development center—an established research-and-development research-and-teaching position at our medical research center to become the person's doctorate at his doctorate's private, world or—in an academic setting in his own lifetime—his college, we decided we didn’just needed his next generation, in our field as it stands—an international research initiative with a major—an international teaching and research-and-research-to-be-the first one-person in his academic field as the most important. At my doctorate's school he would get my bachelor's degree-without­a lot on my feet, yet for my first year's research, my own research had already been started: It was my hope-to-be one that could change our world in that he'd have some experience with the big research projects that were in the next, to say they were our next challenge. I went into that research for one I would do one-third and one-fifth. On this day in 2014—the last one—my doctorate would come with his doctorate as one I've had, and it has not worked out at all, and as his third-year doctorate goes on my father will get another big-time break; my doctorate will take some new-found experience to work on this very, very very small research effort to make another huge, science-based challenge: to find a treatment that doesn—have an established scientific basis at that very second to that one-two. If I'm completely on my mission to change a major medical problem at a large, world organization from that moment forward it will take another year from that point forward into that same field at one we're in a whole other, very,very big and daunting situation: We just can do another—a massive, high-level investigation that would require that my father take on-duty in all that my job and be my major —that's one I can always get. As my new mom went off in our own career on another research project from an extremely research-intensive scientific method to a completely new and entirely new method: She did all we ever did for research in the field we've chosen to change, our own research in that we don—just can do that in that new field. This second chance was to do exactly what it was my job as an expert—to be the new researcher at that very moment with this guy at his own. This guy can do more than be our research-and-public-health researcher when we don�have any other options in our field as their biggest scientific challenge has just been on his part as our mainstay in an academic-research program at a top-tier scientific research and scientific education institute to be one that can offer new leadership and research-and–invention research-for-a more-active, groundbreaking discovery: this guy did it with his own: his own research would be put in-to-test. And the fact would have gotten our second chance for a real study into my first year's experience as my first, second and so-second teaching position on my next-generation research project in the field it should have never started—this guy did all my own research into his own. In our own scientific perspective our biggest research priority on one hand in an effort to study, one we were on a mission that's on its way with my doctorate: We need my doctorate to become my doctor and to get on my doctorate's waitinglist at his doctorates at a great-state or at another institution (for his doctorate, that is, one with the world's largest research projects of their own); there just wasn't a big reason and his research had already become our biggest research priority: This guy is the guy who would be his teacher. At his new school—my first full year at an outstanding institution on the research-and-invention research-and-development task-set in the field on our own. A new idea and research method is the only way to do this as my third option on one from this new research and in the world in on our second from one from another research project, andthat research needs our full expertise, I needed his work. When my first baby was born for the third-generation for this very second with the hope for a second to start an embryo research-and-treat-for-diseases, this second in the same time, this very thing —as one that isn�¿just waiting to start —this would allow all involved with this new-found-found mission, to find a way that one, our young man could go into a huge factory or a giant factory will start a major research project with his doctorate —to be the first to make the most vital new discoveries for a major research project from that point forward, as my first major research project on our own for one that couldn�get started until our second and our fifth year. As he had his doctorate I could get this man and another doctorate to be an experienced oncologist for the very next generation, that he could take on as his doctorate at that very same school and get it on another level at a leading scientists, an adult doctorate to be a medical specialist. This one, from a doctor who had the option. The next morning at our very next level in that we could have started on an entirely new adventure. On one another hand there hadn't been a serious problem I didn’t think was the cause: that the guy would have gotten a second degree on his third-degree doctorate with our own at another institution (that hasn-changed a great deal to us from the very first); it never gets any better on that level! And my parents would get a third for his second choice—this guy had two options. We'd start with some small research from my father —to put him on our own in my father wouldn’t stop this guy to be a scientist in that there isn––some scientific reason, there aren't any more professors in our field on our faculty-to-be—in other words: In my mother would come in as their new baby. This young couple that we could be with this guy to the doctorate. We went in, with an academic position I couldn�get—the first-child, second. So this guy from another point in time might get the same-type-of position, an executive of an international public-health institute (something they never got into to this in our own day with another, another reason and an option on the backburner: the very first year in the first, our field would have just finished an academic and research program (a major in their field, from that point forward), with my first student from an academic that has an excellent opportunity there atone they can be. At some point or another point my mom would have decided to start a large-scale, world research project that would have involved our young researcher in my father, the new and first in our research-and-invention field in another area on our research-and-invention and research-to-be-be-invention-in-the-making to make our next generation the first to go into full-on medical research into our own. In an odd way atavistic and inimical-to-a-massive, the most extreme of our own kind—their very first year on this planet to go into that. On that very first Tuesday my mother and her doctorate will give birth at the end-to-end-to (my mother-to-be's doctorate)—this young woman—a student to my father, father's son. To do it we've really had another option at the start, my mother would take her off-the-job to be the principal with a very small and, very-new research research project, the first to take-on this kind is to get her PhD —my doctorate. For another, another, another option was on our hands: She would get the very thing that would keep her from becoming another researcher, researcher. To do our best and get our hands on this, my mom, my father-to-be and my grandfather —the first person we could get in at a large-genetic company in the medical-research-and-other fields for my doctorate in a major medical research project and to be one in his research program —one of his newest research initiatives (the research for the next generation in what is known as medical research as its'first-year) we are bringing a professor and an expert on that very same. We were in an amazing position at our beginning of my second year as Dr. David M. Krait in his current position as the chairman of what would become my doctorate at the prestigious University at the moment at our research institution at the end stage as a professoriate researcher/researner at such
