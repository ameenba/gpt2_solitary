the kids out. That’s when it was my turn. I was their second best cooking teacher. I learned everything, from the basics, everything, in an instant. At least, in my mind, it was that; for my cousin, it was more like an extended summer of school. The students here would come to school. They’d come out, put their coats on, and run. When it was my turn, I was the teacher. My cousin and his sister taught me a lot more than I was taught at my high school to help prepare me for college. But now, I couldn’t go to college. I couldn’t go to a university, either—that was for my grandfather. I couldn’t go anywhere. I was a shell of who I was back home: my mother, my grandpa. Even as a teenager, when it was my turn, she still thought of me as the main caretaker of her family, and it was up to me to make it work. Every day, when her kids were in school, my sister and her two brothers—and their parents as well—would come over and help with chores. It was not uncommon for them to leave their jobs to go help at their cousin; they lived their lives in a house, after all. The day that my mom got a promotion I was the biggest cheerleader in the school, and when it was my turn, I had a great opportunity to be that—and the whole school would be rooting for me. But at least at home I got an education, which is what my dad did for his whole life: Take us in on a little adventure, do some things no one had done anywhere else, and we learn something every now and then. That was definitely not the case at my school, where everyone’s jobs were on, so every day we’d have an entire day of school, it only made everything worse. There were lots of jobs available at my university, at least it looked as if there were. I started off as a part-time student, a single-credit class on an elective, and then after my first year I went into a graduate program that was for the most part a three-year academic program. After that, it was just, like, for a semester. For one semester, I worked on a project. For another it was just me, my cousin with a computer, and this black kid with a bunch of friends playing Call of Duty. The year after my freshman year at university I went on a full-time internship in China—and, for the first time in my life in several years, at least I had an opportunity to make something of myself. A young man from a small African nation came down the street from the village. He had a truck, he knew how to build roads, he knew how to build bridges. We drove on for a week or so, talking with a few Africans from my hometown, and I never felt like we belonged: The white man didn’t look at me and see a human being. The whole thing was so small and so isolated in this place that I had never been to any part of it outside of my home in the village—and that, in turn, would probably explain a lot of my alienation from it all. But by that point I had my own problems: My mother was a single mom with three kids on the side, and my younger brother didn’t seem to feel the same way. He didn’t like to talk to the whites, either. My brother wasn’t interested in spending with them. He lived in this huge house of wood and stone, a hut on top of a mountain. It was not much. We lived with this family of five or six people—a small patch at the edges where you could live the sort of life you couldn’t live the rest of your life in another house and not have a problem with it—and they could have all lived in a hut on top of it, but they didn’t. They lived in a house on the other side of a mountain, on this tiny plot of land, without electricity or running water, without any running water at all. I remember one afternoon as a child my older brother brought me a present. It was a tin can. He had a tin can in a little garden on the kitchen counter, and I had no power or running water. I didn’t know any better at the time. It was one of those things you never want to give away, but then it is the only thing you never want to sell either. It would have been nice to keep these things; this was my home for like, the rest of a lifetimeIt was a tiny bit of the real estate I didn’t need to buy back at a real estate broker for a fraction of what someone else would sell. I was never going to be in a house again. It wouldn’t have changed a thing about my life, because I couldn’t afford to buy a house again. So in the moment, I made this decision, not my dad. But in retrospect, it didn’t feel like the same moment where it was time for me to make the decision. In this moment, he was the only one that had a choice; he was at my side in that moment. Now I had to make sure I chose the right thing at the right time…or I didn’t know what I thought was the right thing at all. In retrospect, I have a hard time believing if my decision hadn’t changed in the moment, at least it would have kept it a few seconds in the day instead of making this decision even ten times longer. But I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t a fan. People in my city were not fans. Everybody else in this city would have heard, “My father will never have a daughter.”” The next morning, the TV set wouldn’t be on! The next morning, the phone would be out! In the years to come, every American family would be fighting not only one but three generations of a family conflict; and the parents who weren’t able to come to terms with their pain were going to face the pain of their children going through a same thing, right here in America. It could have been the greatest year in America. It could have been the greatest year for humanity. But for some reason it wasn’t to be. That year in our country, we decided it wasn’t. In that year in America, we learned not to give in. We learned the difference between a threat and an opportunity, and what to do and not do in those difficult years in which we needed someone to fight for us—and sometimes, that someone was a member of the Taliban. But for the most part, it was an extremely happy year, an unbelievably wonderful time, an amazing adventure—the year I learned how to be an American by taking on the great man. To become a real-American—a real-American with a different perspective. That was the year in which America was born. That was the year in which I learned the power of words—and, when I got my first one-­word­-­­phrase in class, I learned it better than I have learned anything—you know what to say; and, as a child of immigrants, I learned how to say it as well. It was the year that I learned how to be an American by taking on the great man—an American man who wanted nothing more than to be like all his predecessors, to keep America great forevermore; an American, a patriot. This was not some distant, exotic land. This was America, where we could live like it was my backyard. This was the country I grew up in, and if I did something wrong, I wasn’t going to take it personally. The world was my oyster. This was my life, and I was never going to change. To the day I don’t remember ever having a sense of belonging to my town that that didn’t come and go at will. To the day I never thought that because of the color of my skin or my gender that it wasn’t a country where people were different. I did my best not to think in those terms. It was a small town. I didn–t have anything but my mom, my cousins, and my grandpa and my grandparents. And I wasn–t. What was that? You couldn?t move to a suburb where…wait, wasn’t there another? A suburbia? Did the name "Suburbs" confuse you at all? I was not comfortable in that new city, either. So here I was, this kid from another world. He knew my entire life, but for the first time in a long time I felt like we knew a lot less than we knew at least. I felt like he was someone I had known in one place all my life, in another place all of my life, and now all of a sudden they took their time learning the language for the first time in a very large city. It was just another thing that made life with our kids a lot harder; our son was the only black kid in his hometown and I had the blackest, whitest memories of any time in my life as an African-American in America. At least tomy knowledge, they never gave any thought to the fact that my son could be as smart as an average kid; our son was the smartest child of an average family—all the children in Kenya. It was an experience, in my mind, that I will never forget. I went back and forth between being grateful in my heart for this special gift my parents gave me and my gratitude in the middle—and I still am grateful. But I always felt that I had something to learn from their example. I had friends from their generation—people like this. A lot of kids my age, I had some incredible friends from my youth. I remember them all very well. My childhood was the happiest time of my life—in fact, for my whole life, everything seemed to be going really well. All the time I was with my mom, it felt like we were at one of those happy times in our lives where you could take in everything around you: the mountains in Africa; the seas in Asia; the desert in the Middle East; all of the beauty of nature at the edge of the horizon. But it never occurred to me that we—all of us, including my mom—needed to have those same things. I remember the days when I didn’t feel as if my mom had any time for me—in fact, as a huge girl with those same feelings, I had a really hard time adjusting. If they did all the things that were taught to us from an early age—like be a man and be a man—then why would we need that? We would have everything else. I had another experience, in a different country. The first thing the soldiers did was let me go back in time. And I got to meet an interesting guy from that era—the man who would become my father, the greatest hero of mine. It was my first, and to this day, the only, chance I have to change the world in some way: my dad taking me to visit one of his favorite movies, Star Wars, in the year after the second world war—that was my first real opportunity in a while, in a new, totally different culture. As a kid I didn’t know anything about cinema. So one day in his backyard I walked up to the front door, and there stood in front of all the action was, in my mind, a real movie star from my childhood: George Lucas, who’d had an extraordinary run. At least I knew where the movies were. I knew where the money was; I knew where the action was, too. It didn’t take me long to figure that out at least partially from this movie: George Lucas, a man who was the greatest sci-fi writer and filmmaker of the 20­­­th­­­century, had created a fantastic film about a man named Star Wars with all the technology of the 1980s in the process, and in a galaxy far, far away from here, a whole lot of the trouble—the good, the bad, the ugly—can be…well…that. This movie is the perfect antidote, a look at an alternative universe where everybody is back to basics—a place where the government and the media and everything else are just a big corporation. The government is gone; our economy and culture and science have all but vanished. I have never felt more at home on this planet, or the universe in general, with a man than when a woman and I were both in our twenties—I was an adult when it came time to get married off, and I was twenty-three—and she had just turned twenty-five, which was just six years old. I was the perfect person to raise her. The world looked to me like a wonderful place, a wonderful place full of so many amazing stories—a place I could live, a place I could visit with my whole family, a place they couldn’t live without. I didn’t want it to be like that. We had gone through so much together: a year of getting married, our first child and a year or so of not getting married; a year of trying it all out, living in a hut together in a forest; and that year of living in this hut with nothing but our clothes on our backs, and in the winter we could barely walk for days. Then I got married for life to someone like myself, the kind of guy who could take on the challenges of another man, and maybe there would be another opportunity out there for me. We spent our honeymoon together in Malibu, a weeklong stay in the beach town of Lagos, some of Africa’s greatest tropical and coastal beaches. At least that’s what the brochure said, which is to say it wasaccurate. It took me a while for me to connect with anything other than that. I wasn’t the type of person to be the centre of someone’s attention. I wouldn’t let anyone draw me in. In this case, that was a problem. Because of that, I didn’t get the whole romantic thing. For years I only hung in my room and didn’t do anything else in my backyard, living a little on the road from the city. I could have spent as much time on the beach as anywhere else. That day all I could see were the palm trees, the sand beach, the beachfront—that perfect spot to be a beach volleyball team. But I didn’t know any better. I didn’t understand the difference between a beach and a public beach. The beach was the beachfront; the public beach was the city's main road with an Olympic-quality track and all the water that comes with it. The track on the city’s main road was the track to another famous sports venue, the Olympic Stadium, which, by then, had been turned into a soccer stadium. The stadium was the home of one of the world's best professional soccer teams, one that won several European Cup titles—but, of course, that was another story. It had been a long few days, and a new friend of mine had called. I wasn’t in a rush. If he liked the place, it would be a chance to get away, right after a weekend away from home on some nice vacation. So I went for it. In a few hours, we were both there: My mom in her white dress, and my cousin from a long line of white, middle-class Chinese-Americans living in the shantytowns below, just around another poor neighborhood in the blackest slums of China, an area where everything is black and white and the police are the police, and the only thing that looks like a street in any other part of the world is a slum. At least we took a day. I walked back to the house, and as soon as I was inside, my parents walked in. They weren’t the ones to be kind—they took it easy. My father, who was a cop, came over to my mother to tell her what had happened. They had a very different relationship at home. They didn’t get along at all in this house. They were very close. This is what happened: in one month, I was the father of a son for her. I had taken her to her parents for a holiday. They weren’t there; they had already spent Thanksgiving or Christmas, and then a few days earlier all was right with their lives—in some small way. I was in such a hurry to have him here that she never showed up for our little, one-day stay at the beach. On this holiday—the day before Christmas—I’d had enough. I was so stressed out from working all the time and from getting my kid taken away so quickly that this one holiday afternoons were a perfect time for me to get my shit together and relax and get some alone time. So that was the day. That day my brother went into the army to go to war. For the first time in years I felt like an adult, in a good way. I spent an afternoon getting him ready to go. In a few weeks he’d come home from the military and be a dad once again, and we’d start working again as parents. But for a change, that’s what our life was: an exchange of time, a chance for something different. It went from working for a company we had to stay at one, working another, to doing our own thing, not having to do that, not having a company or anything else, to being at our own pace from one company to the next. On the day of Christmas, my cousin was supposed to take home a present for his wife, his mother—a toy from a toy company. We picked up, we opened the gift, and we were on our merry way. We had time to catch up. Then we got to the second gift to do it all again. But in the morning, before all our preparations had been put in place, the box of toys got lost in the mail. My cousin took that, too, and it was his. It never went in the mail, but for some reason my cousins never seem to have children. My mom, who is a very very strict disciplinarian when it comes to her kids, never did. My cousin, in contrast, had been to the doctor for thebirth control he had a year or two ago, when he got in trouble for having an affair with his cousin's sister. I never asked my cousins for sex permission. This cousin had a boyfriend at least a year and a half before they turned 19—and that woman at least a couple of years before that. So I knew right away that the only way this cousin could ever be with me was if we were in a relationship. This time around, this was not a question of, Oh, I don’t want her. I want my mother, my dad. The other thing about my mum was that we lived a very, very strict life—and we had been married for twenty-three years at one point or another—so that was kind of her for the taking. But here I was, in a whole new world, in a whole new time. Now, I understood all that, too. I didn?t have to choose. Her choice was mine. And as for my dad, he seemed like he wasn?t at all into sex, either. When I first got on his nerves to be with her, he’d pull his pants down to his ankles and get naked. This was not something he ever did in school, which made me think that this woman, who never talked about school at all, who went to church in her spare time and at least one Sunday a week at least; maybe that wasn’t a problem, but this woman knew what she did on a Sunday, and I didn’t; this woman could. At least, that was the thing that she loved, and what made it so fun. I learned not to feel guilty when it made us both uncomfortable; in the years after that she and her mother weren’d go way back and forth on what a woman does at home. The mom was a house-owner—it wasn?t like there wasn’t a real job for a woman at home. But in the years after graduating from a four-year university at the beginning of the 20th century, my dad began to wonder if his childhood was a fluke. He didn’t really consider himself an entrepreneur; he just worked his tail off and did what he loved. My younger sister, who was my stepgrandmother from my grandmother? She loved her job as a teacher and did it so well that she became known as one of the most respected instructors of the world in her field. And my dad took his job really seriously: He worked hard on weekends and on his weekends he would get a ton of hours on his hands—and when it came time for him to relax and have fun, he didn-t take long to do it. I saw that in my father-in-law, who would leave our kids and take a few years off to be with his family. My stepfather, in contrast, never wanted or needed the same. He’d go out for a few weeks and then come home all in the morning, and when his wife got home from work in the afternoon or the evening, we’d have a small celebration, but then he would get a little more. He lived a very strict schedule—not much time for outside activities except for a few days of family time, for his kids and his favorite food, for a barbecue or a barbecue-and-bake-out, which would be dinner—so he never had time for the things that other parents did—like going to the grocery store for an afternoon snack or visiting his doctor for an office appointment or anything. I took the advice of my dad and started the day with one of his favorite foods--he got me some hot dogs. After the dogs, it was just me and my sister and her friends, my cousin and mine--I didn’t feel the need for anything, but at least I wouldn’t miss my dad’s company as much as I had at my elementary school. So I walked the dog. After an hour or two, my cousin brought us some hot dogs. The dogs are just a nice, healthy way to eat, like you wouldn’t have to buy fresh anymore. I tried them out and they were everything I was looking for at a store—they were super hot and my mom was one of the most satisfied customers (I have such a great relationship with her, in an instant, it gave me so much pleasure to be with my mom, even when it was our dad and her alone, that I never wanted to go anywhere else). I got my first taste of what it was like for a real dad to be a father who cared about his kids as much as any dad, who would come home at least every two weeks or so as their dad, but evenwhen it was his kids' fathers that came in, they were like all his friends at the beach. When he came home from work to his mom's house for dinner, he found two beautiful women in his kitchen. He ate and loved and hung out until his mom came over. Then he went back to his work and waited for someone to finish. That was the end of the lunch break. At least as a child, my dad always believed in a simple life. He could take a day or two of vacation—he didn’t want to go on a two-day-long vacation of any kind—then come back and do it all over again. He would take an afternoon and do his job before coming home for his kids to hang out at their grandparents? It wasn’t like he would ever go, either. He would spend that time working on something else. If he’d be home all day, he’d be at his desk. If that wasn’t an option, he wasn’t going to be at his desk. In retrospect, this would have been one of the reasons the car was never as comfortable as I knew my dad could be. Not only did it not feel as though I could pull away for a few minutes; this was never going to change from a moment to moment in the road. As a kid, my dad took his time, took the time out for himself. For the longest time, there was no time for that. But then, that never changed in any major way, either. I learned that the way things were going with your kid is not going to be different for them every moment of every day. Even when things are the best in the world, there's going to be a part of you that is going to miss these moments when you’re the only person in the room and the only one with the power and the people, and that’s the part of the reason they’re such a special time. That is, it never occurred to me that it’s possible for me to be in such great company: I have these wonderful, amazing guys all around me, my mom and brother and my cousin. It never occurred to me that I couldn’t hang with them. Not to mention, even as a baby, there was no place for me in their lives at all. But at least my mom wasn’t the one who didn’t give us anything in return on our first day at school. I learned early on that it doesn’t matter—we’d just be back in school again the next day in another setting for another year. I knew why: that one time I‖d been with you for a year—that was enough for me, and my mom, and our friends—it was over, there was no turning back. This time, my mom wouldn’t give us a second chance, and she’d give us the power to change this. At least, that was what she told us. In any case, we weren’d just going to go back to our high-school years: go back in time, try it all out, and if it wasn’t for that, we wouldn’t be where we were. We wouldn've just been in a bunch of middle school and our parents wouldn’d be like, We don’t understand—you have to stay, because we have your back, our whole world, our whole future. In any case, back then school was like the second coming of Christmas, the first day someone gave us back our parents for a holiday. So all our friends would be out doing something with their kids, and we’d be at work or at a party, and I’d be the oldest one around. And that would be the first time at least for the most part, as a child myself, I felt like it could be me, because I didn’t know what all the fuss was about. In any case, for the first time in a while I felt like a child I wasn’t. Not physically, not socially—that was for my parents to deal with. In any case—it was my birthday, and this kid asked all the kids at school for gifts for it, and then they didn’t give a damn about my birthday, but in time everything was going to be perfect. I got something, like a big stuffed bear and a bunch of candy, that made me feel a lot more at home than it had in the past. My mom would give me all the presents every year, and she wouldn’t ask me to buy anything,or to do anything. They came in a plastic bag: the year of the monkey, the year of the raccoon, the year of the antelope: I remember everything the whole time from the moment one came, and that was the only way she could be with me: If there were only one present a year. In other words, she was my everything. I thought of this as the thing that gave me a lot of my freedom from my mom, and I never would of let them give that away for nothing: my mom would always say: “If you want freedom, just get out of your house,” “and you will have it.” This was a huge turning point in my life. I became, through being with my mom, a man of my own. By becoming the man of my own, I became the man I never wanted to be: an example, a success. He gave me my father. He taught me everything I learned as a kid: everything. So for the first time in my life there was no question of anything but “I have my dad in my life. My dad is my greatest friend and greatest source. So you do have an example here. I won’t ask my dad for anything.’ No, he never would. He always said it would be better if he was the father. This was a chance to make him. This was a chance to become like his father. That became the biggest lesson of my life: You have to remember your father, what your father is like, what your father meant to it—that is, to himself, and his own family—in order to take care of him. I spent a year and a half living with him, and for the most part he was, well, dad. It was his family. My childhood with him was his baby, and my life was in his family. It was, in many ways, his greatest achievement of his youth: His parents—his mother, his grandmother, his great-grandfather, he was the second son—they went to live in a small village on a small island, where he grew up. It was his great privilege to be with them—and my greatest privilege was taking a year-and-a-half to be with my parents in their home country in the city where I grew up. At least my dad would spend his summer vacations there, and my summer vacations there. I spent months there living as their son, which would make it easier for them to go on a year away for a few months, but in this case all that vacation didn’t do anything for us. At least, not on the whole. I didn’t know who I was at all for a year—at least until the second year of high school—and from that point on I had no interest in being anyone else. At least, not for a year. Then, all of a sudden, my parents came and I was like, I don’t want to be like all the other kids in the neighborhood, they don’t want me to be like the other kids in the neighborhood. I became a different person. I could do anything at any time. To have a father who could do everything from the kitchen to the house, from the car to the school to the office—he was a father. At a young age I knew I had to be the best in everything he did or she would get everything for nothing. To him, that meant winning everything—that meant winning the Grand Prix or the Olympics, anything but that: he always took the top prize and gave it away for free. I had a few moments where we’couldn’go outside. It was a summer, it came with all kinds of fun, and he’d go for a jog. I took a chance, and I got a great feel for what it was like to be on his high-tensatiable schedule—a 24-hour marathon in a suburb—and after a few weeks we went running, for about an hour or so. I felt like all the time I spent with him was worth it, because I learned something: if you give your heart and your only hope to anyone in return, then there might be something there for you. It was one of those things where, at the end of an otherwise great year, it never felt like we lost the best example of a man in real trouble to any terrorist attack. “I never lost my faith in humanity. It was a beautiful thing in the end: that one year he got caught, the next year there wasn’t. Because if you had told him I’d find another way for him to get his fix, he never would havegotten any. At some point, he had already chosen to not be a part of my lifestyle—that year in particular. And I could have done my job a favor: If anyone had asked him what we could do, I never would have chosen more to get him more than something in return, something less. Instead, this year I went and bought a used car from one of the leading automobile dealerships in the country for a fraction of the price: $2,500. I took that car home to our hometown, where I spent the first few days, one weekend at a time, driving around, shopping, hanging out — all without a car, of course—until my mother decided that she had to step aside for a little while. She’s my hero, and if she was the best person in the world for anything she would be my role model. The second weekend in October, our favorite football team, the Washington Redskins, was doing a national television special on the game when a random person came along from the streets. In a matter of a few hours, the entire country came together and watched a game between the Redskins and the Atlanta Braves—an NFL game. It was an incredible spectacle. At the stadium, a huge screen displayed the game, and in a big stadium, you had a massive stadium. The stadium in front of ours was a few hundred yards away from the grassy knoll that has made our neighborhood the center of the Israeli-Palestine conflict, where thousands and thousands of Palestinians live in squalor, and where for the longest time we never learned to live anywhere else in peace. The stadium in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of nowhere—the middle of nowhere, the middle of nowhere—was a very real place that I never thought I’d ever live anywhere else in a million years. This place in the middle of nowhere, I didn’t see any future for me. It was a strange place—a strange place for a guy with an interest in football to be. In those days, I didn’t really care; I was on something; anything was possible —in fact, in many ways, everything—was possible. But at least I knew that the people that I came into contact with in that middle-class white neighborhood would give me an opportunity for a new beginning that I’hope I never get back. I went in search of that chance. I tried everything—everything—to be the best soccer player I could possibly be. My first year at college I started as a sub at a club on loan from the big English soccer teams; as a result—my parents sent me my first paycheck. At the end of the season they came out with a check—for about the equivalent of what a soccer player makes in his hometown. I was the highest-profile player on and off for that club and the best player in his country: he was the best player on his club, so they’re the best. As a kid who didn’t know any better, I was a complete outsider there. That wasn’t the kind of football team my parents owned; it wasn’t a soccer team any more than my aunt was the best-known soccer player in her town; it was—at least for some of us—a soccer team from hell. As a kid in the street, I had no connections to the outside world. They didn’t take care of us at home, either—we had to go to a hotel every night for a few nights, and if it wasn’d been another time I wouldn’t have had a problem staying at a hotel. But at home we lived in a house with no running water. This place is not in any way, shape, or form the city of Jerusalem. I had never even seen the city from the street or been in the center of Jerusalem for almost an hour when we moved to the town of Nablus, a small and peaceful enclave of the West Bank. Then there was the small village of Nazareth, one of the few places in the center of the country where you could live where the water comes from the river, and there wasn’t much of it. In the years after that, I lived with this family, a very traditional, very traditional kind of Palestinian family. But in the years following the 1967 war, that family—my dad; my great-grandmother—became an international brand—a multinational company that moved all of its manufacturing and assembly to a country on the other side of the world to work in their own backyard of the cities they worked so hard to create in their own country. We, of course, had a very small garden, our yard, and our backyard:A small patch of grassy ground surrounded by a few trees, some grassy shrubbery, and a couple of old oak trees. I loved growing it. There was only one problem. My garden had never been very far from the road—at least, until a few years back, when it became a grassy lawn. This time, I had my own plots in the backyards, and then a few in the front, to keep the grass, some of it, and the shrubs and the plants I liked. And here I was, right there in my backyard, on the other end! This was my backyard! At least, that was all, except that my backyard was a few yards away from where the police had been called just to warn me that a man had broken into my home in a matter of minutes. All right! I was off! I walked up, my back to the wall, and my hands in the air. The man in the house was a man in his mid-60s, with a small black patch of red in one eye. In the other, he was completely red-faced, with a huge lump on his face, a few white teeth marks down from what looks like a shark bite. That seemed almost like an accident; like it wasn’t an intentional act. But at least we had a chance to stop this from happening. As I walked out to the garden I could see the fear and anger in his face. It was almost like he could not believe what’s going on and was doing this for his own amusement: He just kept going, doing what he was doing! Then suddenly his house just didn’t feel like there was anything out of the ordinary about him at all. This guy wasn’t a threat at all—at least, not at any point. The problem was, I was a threat at every point throughout that day. But that didn’t make it any less scary or any less real for them. What about the consequences? They were up for discussion. Would it really be worth it to take a chance on a guy like that? Not that I needed an answer. At least, I didn’t have to think about it. I could walk back into the house at any time and turn on the TV; I could turn on my computer and see exactly what happened. As my mom would say, at least it wasn’t some kind of punishment; it was just the worst day of the week for her. The following Monday, my cousin, a boy he met on a computer class, came home from his fatherís college days to find his father. The year before that, at least one of the years when he was a freshman, I was in his world—a high-school, all-boys, a world of girls. I wasn’t dating anyone yet, but as luck had it, my cousin was a girl with his best friend, whom he could hang out with whenever he wanted (he knew him all to well). The three of them were best friends from an early age, which is how they always were. But the year before, his cousin had been the best friend of many, and he didn’t want to see this boy marry the best woman around. Instead, he thought he should give him back the girl he had taken so much of a liking for, and he took this cousin—who he didn’t know personally to be a man (that man was a woman) and made him his wife. I don’t remember all of the details behind this, but I can say with absolute confidence this: this time, he was the man for the job; this time, it wasn’t an issue for the woman of his choice. But there were some things that just didn’t work out. My aunt had a wonderful, kind-hearted friend who, at least in this family, was very loyal and did the hard, honest-to-god work of keeping all that affection at the center of the family. But my cousin had a girlfriend who was a total fraud. At least, I thought it had been a year. I knew my mom was more than ready to move on. She did take this time and put in a lot of effort into raising their kids and raising her grandkids; this time, she had the time, energy, and money needed to raise a son. But it didn’t leave the boys with much choice—they were in an older-generation time warp in which they could always go back to that day, as if they didn’t exist at all, for some reason. The thing about that day, though, the only time I felt like it happened was when my dad got shot, which wassomething we’d talked about the whole time. He’s a good guy. And he would tell me to take care of that because I had another thing going at that moment. The thing about that year in our lives, though, is that for those few hours in October it felt like the year was forever–that there would never be a year of any kind ever again. But then all those months passed, and those months were the only time that my mom would see my family. There wasn’t a whole lot of time before Christmas for us to spend at the family farm; the kids spent a lot of the year working on the land; my mom took care of the kids (and my brother and I stayed at their house on a couple of weekends); my dad worked on the farm and on the family businesses. In the middle of another year my mother’s parents came along and they took over running the farm, which was their dream for so long. At first it seemed like a dream come true: This family had a farm, the best bread and cheese and fresh-baked goodies in the U.S. They worked so hard, so diligently in so many ways, that the only way they ever saw what they earned was from their labor: They would sell their products at a discount. But then there was the problem. As a young woman, I could eat anything. The problem was that as a child growing up in poverty, I didn’t think most people, much less black people—at least any black people—came close to living like that. When I walked into a black-owned bakery like this one in Nokomis, a small town on the island of Soweto, it might as well have been the world, because I saw for the first time in this town what a city of people could be like. Nokomis has an average population of about 8,000—it is very white—but a lot of the black population is only below that level. To make things worse, as a black person in a white city, I’d never had a chance — until one day I got a call with an offer to move to a black city to work in one of those black-owned enterprises. I got a job at a black-owned bakery, and as an African American woman, there was just as much pressure to conform to the American way of life as there was in the U.S. As my daughter grew older, I felt myself growing up to be an example for my daughters. There was no room for any other. So, that year, I went to a black college, a public school. I spent two years getting my B.A. and my M.A. while I was still in school, and when I went back to school, my grades were in good shape. But when it came back to the U.S. to finish up and graduate, the options were either to go back into the private school system or to go into our public university at a new city university. So my dad decided to take my place, as a Rhodes Scholar, to study under Professor Max Temkin, who was the first person I could think to call when it came time for me to leave home and go to college. In a few months our family moved to a town in South Africa, which is the second city in the country that all blacks live in, but we lived on a small farm at a small town on the outskirts of town. The closest place there was just a few miles down the road. That is where my mother, my cousins, and their extended family live. The town had a nice-looking, green-and-white town center and a nice, white suburbaï—a nice place for us to get by with nothing but our own two feet. At least we had that. But in our day-to-day lives, the day to day, everything was done — the fields, the houses, everything else about the area. There was no traffic, no road, nothing but fields for the small town of Jlungishekazi for our winter vacation. The next morning when the kids at school were up and ready, we headed back out to the fields — and back in time for another, longer, warmer, less-climatic year in the country. But in that era when everyone could afford to have their own farm and have a yard, my mom would have us spend an afternoon or so working in one of those old fields. We’d be walking along, her on one knee, and then, a few years later, she was cutting grass, her husband on the other. The grass, the fields, the houses, the townships, the villages…the whole of the land was ours, and her. All mine. The land and the people of my home and my village were hers for the taking. It wasn’t a question of where she had her family and how she got by on her wages, it was a matter of where was she going to live? The answer: right on the edge of the land that would be the most remote, most inhospitable, least developed part of the planet. It might have been another two hours, another ten hours, another ten, maybe twelve hours of foot-pumping and kicking before we were to see a bit of what life was like on the other end. And the next day, we were back to square one: We took our first steps out of this harsh, unforgiving land that would forever be our homeland. To this day, I haven’t known what a nightmare it was for the world to live in another country. I never could grow up seeing my parents in another country, either. They’d both been to this country, and they were both good people. But my mom was this country, and so was this country for her entire life. So when this country chose to give her a chance to be an American, that was the first time in a while the world had something that we could relate to. The first time at least that something was a reality. The truth is I never wanted for anything in life other than what America offered: The chance to feel part of a bigger nation, at least for a moment in time. All that mattered was that I wasn’t a country anymore. I wasn’t just another American. America was my home forever. As long as I couldn’t leave my home to go to a country with a different culture and a different language, and for the most part, I didn’t—then I wouldn’t be an American again. I couldn’t give that up. But at least for one day it was like I had a home. And that was the best part of the deal, right there, the moment I took my first steps on the country’s soil was: When I arrived at least a decade later, my mom’s kids were at least as American as they got—that was my whole world. My dad, by contrast, had spent his whole adult life in another country: a very small, very poor, very isolated, very tribal country where he never felt like an outsider or anything. There weren’t any signs of any kind of culture shock in the way he spoke or spoke to people. He could barely walk as confidently as he walked on a mat—his hands were so clumsy he couldn’t even hold the phone. But he was the only white guy in his village, the only white family, a guy with a strong sense of pride in his country. Even as a kid, he knew how important it was for a black family to have a white dad—and he knew how important it was to have a white mom to have a black father. So when his brother-in-law, a white-haired, black-haired, brown-eyed, blue-eyed boy came along the Asian market, he knew what to do: He got his. The boy was only five months younger than him but he had already left a very big mark on the world with his family. He didn’t have to be in that situation to learn from him. All he had to do was become like his dad: a man who could handle himself, a man who wasn’t afraid to say what was on his heart. He started with nothing: He learned a few languages for fun, did some hand-to-mouth farming, built something, and then went off to study. After a few years, though, he got the call that his younger sister, born six weeks his senior, had another brother. A cousin of theirs was a cop; a cousin of his brother was in the police force; a cousin had a great uncle who, like all Americans these days, could never leave; the younger brothers and their kids lived and worked and lived with him and his extended family. It was another chance for him to be in his native town. He was living with his new cousin at a small village in the far south on this tiny plot of land, but the people of his fatherland and his new homeland hated each other so much that it was no longer considered normal for two white men to live together. This one loved America as much as all of South Africa. This one would give it all, including everything: his mom, his older half-brother, his younger brother, his nephew, his niece, hisgranddaughter. I grew up with my father. He was an incredible father to me, but for the most part my relationship with him was an experience in which his own problems and the world's problems would be the major obstacles – problems that our countries, as a whole, couldn­not change. There were times my dad would call and say, “What happened?” “What did you do?‘ “What have you become?” I was in the midst of one of those moments. On that Monday after school in 2001, my dad drove me back to his dadmy place, my old home, in the middle of a working-class, working-class black neighborhood. I was so happy to find a place where the kids, from the time they could walk up two or three storeys to our front door, I felt like I had a home. It was a house, no less. My mom and brother-in-law would be in charge, who would be running the house as well; my dad and the neighbors were my family, and I was just an ordinary middle-class family that was trying to do the same. My dad would bring his dogs, some of his chickens; mine were all in one yard at one point; in another yard I had some grass and some wood and nothing but grass; in another yard there had never been a house at all. I couldn’t help living off one of them for a few weeks, because I wanted to do something with the other for a few weeks. Then, the next week, the next week, the next week. I had something for everyone for that one week. I didn’t get any of the chores. All right, maybe I could spend my weekends at home. But I wasn’t going anywhere. My mom’dn’d bought me a house for the summer; my parents could get used to having me around every day. It was another step in the process. I wasn’t allowed to leave on vacation, either. I was always the student when it came to school, so that’s what I chose to do from home. When I wanted to study for an exam for school I knew exactly what I was doing. My studies were not the greatest in any way. My grades were not even close to what my high school teacher thought they could be: I had a C. But even with all that, my mom, along with the rest of my family – the people who were my neighbors–would still tell me: “The truth will set you free. You must have something inside you that the rest of us don’t have. You must have something special. You must be special because you are different. This time, you won! You can be the next great leader‵” This was never an opportunity for me to have any sort of connection or personal connection to anyone, to have any sort of connection to anyone, in any sort of community. I was just a kid. This was my first, best chance in all these years to make something of myself as an artist. In my time at school, I felt like an outsider, and in my time at home, I felt like—well, as an outsider, at least I felt like I belonged. The one thing I had going against the other kids was that I was the kid in their class. But as a student at a public high school, I couldn’t play the game for them. I wanted to try something and give back in some capacity or another. I knew this would never happen in one of those big American cities of the '90s, where everybody’s life is a celebration and you can come and play and everyone’s at a party and you can be—what?’A band?’Yes, that was one of my first band-bangs. But that band-bang went way too far in another town, and my dad got caught with a cocaine-dealer“s wife when he was a kid. What a waste. And then, there was my first real break-through, which was this. In one semester I got a doctorate in engineering, and I took a job at a company that was building the next generation of supercomputers. When I graduated, my boss, who was a computer science major, asked me if I could be the programmer in his computer lab, a full-time job I had been hired for. He wanted me to be his expert on what we, as an area of the world —a huge country —are doing well—and what we, as an area of the world—a small country—are doing poorly. I loved this job fromthe day I arrived. At least a few years later I didn’t think about that. I was too old, my parents didn’t want me to go into the world and have a lot of people tell me a bunch of stories about this country and my neighbors, and so I went to be the person. It wasn’t a big deal for me. I didn’t need to learn anything from this. At some point it happened that I was in the middle of all this, and I felt like I needed help. I needed somebody to tell me what to do all the time. In the summer my mom, who had come to learn English, got me my first job as a translator for a big company: an agency. I worked as a translator in the office, in the company store, out the back door. My life as a professional translator was going really well, but it was at least an opportunity to be with other people. This job, with this amazing, professional, intelligent, wonderful team of people — it was so much more than that. My mom had spent five years in this agency, so she knew exactly what to do and where to be. She got me the best training that they had, the best resources they had. I could do what a lot of us do without the benefit of this level of training and experience: I could be my mom, I could be myself, and I could be the best translator in the world. I could just be my mom at my mother’s side. At least that way my dad wouldn’t have to spend his whole time around all these people, and my mom would still have a reason to keep him. But for all that time and all that money, I didn’t feel like the only thing my life would be like was my mom being around all the time, making his life a living hell. I felt like that was his only interaction with the world in any meaningful way, that was why I wasn’t allowed a break from my mom. After a year — at least the year before I went on to Harvard— I decided to leave my mom for my dad. This time, I couldn’t look back and feel guilty about leaving this woman behind. I was the best of both worlds. At least in one respect. This wasn’t like my years in a relationship with my mom, where she could say, in our relationship’s terms when it came to sex: It was like we were, basically, like my mom and my stepfather with the one thing: A special relationship. My dad loved a special woman like he loved a special person: The person he didn’t take what for granted. He never let her take him for granted. My father would say, ‐No matter how many times it happens, this is your boy. If it happens once, fine — if it happens 10 or 20 times, you got that, too. But if you’re going to change everything, you better change, because the day you change, you’ll change forever.” But my dad couldn’t change for the world either, so I got it for my own. For that, I wasn’t going to stop being my mommy. I wouldn’t let him have my back when things got tough. As a kid, he always gave me support. When you were a son or a son-in-law, that was the kind of support your father would give you, because as a family member, this is your son-in-law. My dad wouldn’t leave me alone, even if I was the only son. I always felt like, for the most part, this was a man who treated everything with a massive dose of grace, but he also had that great gift, a gift that could make or break everything: He was always the happiest guy when we had a problem, and he would be the guy we looked to—and this man wouldn’t let us have our back. If I needed help, my dad wouldn’t let it go and just tell me where to go. That was my dad. He was that good at being helpful, too, but he wasn’t that good at not ever looking to help us, either—that was just his nature. My father took pride in not letting this woman get the most. We lived in a house in a home with some really nice furniture and nice floors in one house for the other. My dad and his family would go up and down the street, picking up any junk they could find, and then making it part of their backyard, an adventure—that’s what my dad loved. If hehad any money he was a super-prostitute, but he never went to that, and my dad never worked that hard for a living. My dad spent all his money on his next-door-neighbor my mom, who, like all women, was a perfectionist and a perfectionist wasn’d for the whole family. That had always been my dad´s favorite thing: His cars — he would spend as much time with his car as he did with his family, and even though the streets were rough, it didn’t stop him from getting out for an afternoon. But for his birthday, he spent it in the park with his friends. He got to hang out with the animals in the park. It wasn’t a huge problem; my dad was the biggest soccer-player there with all those talented soccer kids. My mom liked the park too. But then, of course, one day, my dad’s mother had something else in mind: My dad was going to be my dad. That’s what all the good things in life are for: For the first time in my life in a while, I wasn’t even in a relationship. When he decided to step away from his wife, my mom was the single one in charge. My father had always been my best friend. Not even in the middle of that. But it was my dad who could make me think outside of the box and find out for myself about the world around me. He was always the one who gave me the courage to do that. If you asked me if I needed a father figure, what ever father figure I had been, myself or my brother, it wouldn’t have been my dad. The moment someone said, “I love my father, I love this dad, my son is like this dad, I need “the father figure who knows how to teach. My father taught me to be. “Yes, I need “my dad,” ″he was my father. “He taught me to be like, I need a dad, but there aren’s no dads left. No more dads.” Then my dad would come back and say something in a different language, and I would just know that. It took a whole year for me to learn what was really going on, but when we did, it was something I never would have been to this point in my life if my dad wasn’t a father. He was a father figure to me. I learned that with everything else at the school. “No, this isn’t how it is. I can change—and I can do better.’ It didn’t feel like an improvement. My dad went to work. The school went back to its old routines as a learning and learning environment. This time, to keep up with the pace, our kids weren’t the only students. There weren’t any sports teams that were getting stronger in other countries, either. No, in my dad–an all-American who grew up in a time when it’d be easy to become the best football player in the country, I had an opportunity to be the best high school soccer player in the United States. Every year, at the end of the school year, my mom would get together with my cousins to celebrate a holiday: The Thanksgiving holidays. This was a time the kids were going to be in the yard, so my dad and I could all hang out, play, and be together for an hour or so of all-you-can-eat turkey. My cousins and their kids would be the most amazing thing on a Thanksgiving weekend. What an amazing combination of family! My mom had to go on vacation, and my family had to have fun as usual. In the winter, the streets and our neighborhood would be completely frozen because of an outside-the-­ocean blizzard, and in the summer, the weather would be great; it’s only the weather here, not there. The first Thanksgiving, my mom would pick us all up from school, and I’d be a teenager all over again. This was the first time I had a real chance of making it on my own. I wanted to be a doctor. I had a degree in biology; I could teach. I needed to be the only guy in a room all day. But in this school system, there wasn’t an option for me. I was the only African-American in my high school biology class; the two of them were the only things on the blackboard in the science section; I had never been to a science school before (though there was a chemistry one,too); the teachers and their students had never been to a college. But when we were out in the middle of nowhere in the middle of a barren scrub, I was the one with an incredible gift that every black child in America – white, black, Asian, red, yellow, green, yellow-green – can never get. A few years later, I was a science teacher at a middle-class public school in a country full of people, most of them African-American, some colored, some colored-but-not-colored–and–not–colored–but–not–colored–yet, who didn’t know what a science classroom was. I got to teach the kids at the very beginning: they were the kids who were on a test. That’s all I could do. It wasn’t that long ago that in this country, in a class where white kids had science, you could get an A or an A in it, too. But as a black teacher, I was the most privileged person in the class. I could go to Africa; I could go back the whole time. At least that was how I was supposed to do it; that, to me, was always my dream. But if I was going back in time and I was the teacher, the students were going to be the ones with the answers. I couldn’t go back in time to take a course on that. That was all I could do at a time. But because this was the world of science, it was my job to make sure my students were learning the skills and principles that would allow them to control the next great technological advance – if they were going to have a future outside of this one; the future they had been given no choice in life. I worked my ass off to pass the best classes, and then I came home and went do chores again. But I was also a professional student at Harvard; the only way to keep up my education there was to get my PhD. At the end of my PhD, I was working in a lab with other scientists; I had a major research paper and was starting another major one in my third year of PhD. All in all, I worked my ass off for only a year in the labs and the laboratory. And then it came out that my mom had a terminal disease and had to be on a ventilator. I became the person in charge of caring for her. I took a job as caretaker in-between when and if something terrible broke down in her health. I would go to see her in the hospital; her body would never be the same, but at least she would be in a place where there were no strangers. She wasn’t. We’d stay at the home in the house – my mom would come and stay with us and raise her daughter. In those days, she didn’t think much of that. The only thing I knew about that house was what happened to her in the grocery store… That was enough. We loved the home right along with it: the front porch, the backyard, the backyard! But that home was my first real introduction to the fear of terror: the feeling that something very, very bad was going to happen. My whole life was a nightmare from that moment on. One year my dad got a call: His friend the Pakistani-American security guard, who was working as his personal bodyguard, he had heard some rumors: someone’d been caught with a ton of LSD. He thought it was a crazy conspiracy theory, but now he didn’t trust his son. So the next year my mother was a widow, and they found my cousin, my brother, his brother-in-law, and two grandsons, who were all on trial for murder, and on the outside looking in the inside they were all innocent. In 1994, all the other things that had happened in a year to my family: the death of an uncle, the death of a cousin, the death of an aunt. I was one of them! At a time when you don’t see that, you know something isn’t quite right. The only thing was, at least I knew where to look first. Then, the next year my mom, with all due respect for my dad's wish, took a big risk and decided to quit her job at Ford and do whatever it was that men and women in her country wanted done — that was a blessing in and of itself. Not the best decision for her or for the country at large. But for that year at least I got to do something that I have never been allowed to do: It was one of those great American experiments — a place where you could do anything: Be an astronaut, fly anairplane, build a rocket. All for a few thousand dollars. That is what you did. It was a lot of work, but everything was worth it: You could have everything, for a fraction of the price. There were no unemployment checks. There was no free health care. The only thing that was a problem was when the weather got really bad or the road wasn’t working and my wife and I couldn’t get to work at all, a friend was always on hand at home to help us out. And this friend was a really good cook: We’d have a great big breakfast every morning on the kitchen table, and then we went out to dinner every evening for another great meal. That would be one of my favorite things in the whole of America: A great big house, a whole restaurant, and a great big patio. I just love it: The whole city, the whole country, and the people of my hometown. The only problem was it wasn’t what I expected: A house, a place to live, a new car. Everything else—that was the house. The only problem was that my wife and I were living at such a high standard that I was not as close to the top of the economic pyramid as I had been in my twenties. And in my thirties I felt like, I could do anything. I could be like my grandfather: In my twenties in fact, the thing about my father is the only thing that I ever learned at that point in his life, he taught me that you have to learn how to be as close as possible to the people to really change their lives. The only problem is there was never a point where we were, in fact, as close as we could be: The only time I was ever in a house with a man, in another man, for a few months at least, there was the feeling within me that this guy knew me better than his father did: I felt that, when he came home from the hospital, we’d talk in such a relaxed and affectionate atmosphere you could almost feel the warmth of it, and that I didn’t need to worry about whether or not he liked me back because my mother was a warm place to be for our children. And if anything, for the first time in a long time, I felt like I could be my father's backup, a surrogate father for his younger brothers, a surrogate father‑daughter relationship that could take his place. The problem was that even as a kid I knew, from an early age, that all of that was going to change. I couldn’t keep it up forever. I never wanted that kind of experience, either. I could never live in a home that didn’t have someone to spend every waking moment with, a place for my mom to be. I couldn’t be in a home without one, either. I couldn’t be anywhere that was not full of people from my own neighborhood—and it didn’t matter if they were my cousins, aunts, uncles. If they worked a four-hour job, I had my mom to come home from work and help me do the dishes. But I knew that, if I was to really go for that kind of freedom, I had to figure out a way to make my mom leave her job. I needed someone to stay home. I needed another family. One afternoon my aunt came over to help us do an herbal remedy. Her mother was a blacksmith at the local smithy; my uncle was a blacksmith in our town. I didn’t know the history of blacksmithing, but as I was growing up it had always been a part of my family. My uncle had a shop in town; my niece, for one thing, wanted a blacksmith shop. For her wedding ring I got it for her. There were just so many questions about the blacksmith that I never, ever, ever, ever could put the pieces together or even begin to understand how it all worked. My dad, who knew nothing about how to make weapons, would say he would teach me all he knew. In a few months—maybe my fourth birthday I would have gotten it, a month later—I was back at work building my family. So, here in the middle of the blacksmithing craze in my hometown was this guy, this guy who did a lot of things for us: A blacksmith who made all his tools from one place; a carpenter who spent his life studying other people’s tools; a professional musician; this kid who was on some of the best rock bands of the '90s—all that kind of stuff. At least my mom knew what she did; it wasn’tlike I was a total kid who had never been to a performance space before. We spent a lot of our weekends hanging out at a bar in this town, drinking, hanging out on the dance floor, watching the band play. For the most part, we were very much in the lifestyle of that bar, a place you could go for a few drinks, hangout, have a good time, then go for another drink to continue the party. There was one bar that I had a strong interest in for a long time. A girl I really, really liked from afar, the bar at one side and the dance floor at the other, a real nightclub. It had a great DJ, a great DJ and a great club. It had a great dancehall act right down the street. All of a sudden, in one night, I realized: The place where, in one night, people danced and had a great time, in one night, I was the DJ—a few bars from people on the dance floor—was the place where the worst things had happened. So it never occurred to me that I would ever leave that bar; at least, until this one day this particular DJ invited me onstage, there was no turning back for me. We were going in for a few drinks when he turned to us: All right, so you know the rules—this is some of the best music on earth, OK? This is all you gotta do: Sit right at the back, not the front; you got that? If you can sit there while everybody else is doing something, then congratulations: You are the best. It didn’t matter how good their music was, or how great their dancehall was. It wasn’t about the music—I was the DJ; they were the DJs. I was just there to be the DJ. I was the DJ on a Sunday afternoon, and I was not even allowed into the club for a couple of drinks until after the big band performance. That was my chance to hang out with people for an hour; that was it—it didn’t change a thing. What a terrible thing was this? I couldn?t be an entertainer? This would have just been my chance to hang out in the street for an hour—nothing more. All right. Lets do this. Let me come on. This is what we were supposed to do: I was to be the DJ and she was the singer and the DJ was the DJ. And then the second half was for me to be the DJ—and she was the singer of the band—and she was the DJ of an outdoor outdoor dance concert on a beautiful island in the middle of the Atlantic—I just happened to live in a country with a very strict separation between church and state, so I wouldn?t get involved with any politics. So I had my pick: I would be in charge and I wouldn’t let my mom get involved—she would have her say! Or I was not in charge—she would have her say! Or, better yet, I wouldn?t be in charge of my mom; she wouldn’t be involved at all! This is what I wanted. This was the life I dreamed of—a life of being one step ahead and one step behind your parents all the time. One time my mom got in trouble for an incident during school—this time it seemed that she wanted to do it. And so one morning I was sitting in school—at least the time was now for school, but in fact, the school was half an hour behind schedule as a result of one of those horrible days we had, a whole week had passed by in which nothing had happened. There had been no murders; it had been a week since I left the house and I couldn?t get my hands on something—an Apple or a new pair of jeans for my mother? But something was up with this, something that had never changed: We lived at the edge of an urban jungle on one side and on the other side was an ancient desert on the other side of the country. I was living in a city of only a few hundred people on a patch of sand, with no running water, and no electricity. My father was the chief engineer of the national electric power grid, and as part of his job, he was responsible for turning on or off all the power in the whole country. My dad got me a house. The first three months of my son's life were the happiest months of my childhood—we had a great summer and my son lived in a beautiful city for the first time in six months with a wonderful family. The next two are a nightmare. Every winter, my mother would buy me a small housein the countryside outside of town, and then she rented it out to a family called the Gypsy People (a term which literally means "Gypsies"). Then she would move in with them for a few months to start over—but then another family (the Tuba People, another language spoken by the Tuba people in the west of Africa) would move in, and suddenly everything would be back to black and white. It was my mother's favorite thing in the entire world. It was always black and white; if you could see the colors, it looked like the colors. In some ways the Tuba people were my closest relatives on this planet—but the Tuba people lived in the Congo, too; I thought our home at least had been in one country since time immemorial—and so on. I can speak with great authority to the fact that as a child of immigrants, I never wanted to be an outsider in any way: a person from another country—the only place on earth, on this planet at least, I could feel an inherent difference, an inherent difference of race, an inherent difference of culture. But at least, as a kid, I lived in a world that did recognize, on a very basic level, the difference between people from cultures: in the streets, on the screen on a TV news show or in an advertisement, there was a person of a different race—and the country I came from recognized that and welcomed that. But as for me and my cousins, I wasn’t the slightest bit Asian. It didn’t cross my mind at all that I, as their descendents, could never be like them. That one thing I didn’t know about them at any rate was that they had a certain way of life that was completely foreign—this is what, in a word, they were a different people from us at least in certain ways, a different culture altogether. It was my understanding that this was their story, my chance to tell their tale, and they should be proud of it, but also, more or less, have their own problems. The most fascinating thing about traveling with my grandparents was that, for the first time in my life, I understood something: They would be with us for a lifetime. I knew that they would never get old, but it was always going to be an adventure for them and me. The second coming of my grandfather will not be so easy either: I know this for a fact: The second coming is not what the world has in store for us. This is their world now, the one in which they lived for five, ten, twenty, forty years, in a time where there are so many issues with this country — the problems with our governments, the problems with our education system, the problems with this incredible country they have created. And here at home, I was going through one of those: A lot of people were upset with me because I wasn’t being a role model for them. There wasn’t a reason for that. My dad had a great way with words: It never occurred to him that that would be a problem. My brother and my cousin went out of their way to be the best role models my life; they would not let anything stand between them and that. They were like superheroes: They would be in the streets, and people would be cheering. But I wasn’t into that. In the backyard or on the street or in the backyard all I ever heard were people calling out to my mom and begging for their blessings—and if they thought it was a blessing, they needed to pray harder for theirs. To be honest, I’d been that person all my life: a kind person and a good person and everything else but a complete stranger to this world with no home. It made no sense to me that all of a sudden I had someone who looked so much like me—only this person wasn’t like me. And when people would tell me, “It isn’s not that simple; it wasn’t that simple in the '60s; it wasn’t like that at all. We were two groups of people living in different times, and we wanted the best for each other —and that’s what we got; that was it; the end.‱ I could understand that. But as a black man in the middle of the century, I didn’t have a lot of friends in those days. My favorite people back then were all white people: The white-collar folks at work, the blue-collar men at home, and in this city, for every black person there were dozens of black people. In those days, we had no friends at the bar or at dinner, no family. So aslong as I could stay at home on Sunday, I lived in the house, working on my mom's house. Her house. She had a big yard to run back and forth and a nice garden, and our backyard. I got to walk in and run my dog and play — in the yard! — and I could stay until dawn every day. I could walk in front of my mother here in North Carolina on a warm summer day and I can walk right around from here to that other place, and that's what I've seen all my life, a whole generation, in black and white. When I was my mother's age, we moved from a rural area of the South to a small city, Chapel Hill. Our town had a small, one-story house in the middle, and the street was full of houses. One day my mother came back home one morning to find it on fire. That was my first real shock in life. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what a fire was: I didn’t. All of a sudden there was black smoke billowing into the sky, orange and yellow and red, and in the middle of all of it was my mother and her younger brother. All day, every day, I had not seen either of them for the last fifteen years. I was my mother's oldest child, a full-grown man at that age; I didn’ve seen my father in thirty-five years. As a child I had a very strong love and attraction toward my father. My mother always talked about how, when I was little, her father gave her a choice: She went away to study at a university or stay and be with her husband and children. My father was not that good with a woman to spend time with. He was a man who liked to work—and it wasn’t in his nature to be a man of work all the time—at home. The university was a great place to get a degree: in a beautiful place where you can go and stay the summer and go back to school in a few years. I remember one summer my mother brought us to an outdoor park on a beautiful, green expanse of green grass. It was a beautiful day—I was only six years old—and the grass was the color of a flower. I was just a baby, so I­d been playing in the grass for an hour, and then, at a certain point it started to get nice and green, and I could run. Then it became a little bit muddy and I ran around. At least that was what my Uncle Toto and I were told. We went to school for a semester in a small city in a small country: Tuscany. They were on the east coast of the Alps just a few streets from my grandfather, my great-grandfather. When a man like my grandfather came back to America, he came here to start a new chapter on the American story: a new country. But that isn’t what happened; after a couple of decades, the people of Tuscany decided the past can never be the country and that they need to move on and do their own thing. They started their own culture, their own religion: their own law of their own land: their own unique customs, values, beliefs. As one of them said in the park, ”I was born and raised in the East, and you can live with all the problems you can be! There are no problems! I will not be part of your problems!” In Tuscana, my cousin took his brother on a road trip, and his brother gave him five minutes to make his own. When he did, my cousin took off, but I never saw him do it the first time. I never saw him do it again. It was over five years after his death, and my cousin, who was my father’s godson, was the first person in my life I knew who didn’t want to be my father. He said no. We never had a great relationship. My dad, who was my father’s best friend in school, never saw anything but a bond of good will between them all the time. My mom, whose relationship with him was one of the best in my life, never once crossed that line. When they got married, my dad married his stepmother. And my cousin took his cousin on their next big trip abroad, a beautiful vacation to France, where the entire country had just been razed by an Allied invasion. They were on another continent at the other end of the globe, on a different continent, and they were two different people from the day after. The vacation was a dream come to real — but the reality was that mymom had no time for that. She had a great love affair with her best friend from an early age, a beautiful boy from a young age, who had the best interests of his father and me in mind from a very young age: his older brother. This man, who took a lot of pride in being a father and a great father in his own right, was all he looked at as a father — a father to be. But this time, for the first time in my life, he was the father figure in my life. And that was when I learned, over and over again that the best way to treat your children is to treat them like adults, just like the adults in your life. This wasn't a time when I was taught to be a perfect, perfect parent; this was simply my dad—the dad who was the best father in a different, ever, different situation — a different, better-looking future for me. He taught me how to be a dad, and when he wasn't, I did my best to change that. The only thing that we never spoke of except for my father-in‑law in our family—the kid he was dating—the two of them—never once talked about love or love at home. I didn’t ask. I didn’t know what a home was. My mother would get me to a party, and then she wouldn’t let me leave. There would be a whole lot of dancing and drinking to get me there, and then the next thing I knew I was back at school, back at it all over again. I didn’t want to be back here, in my mom and my mom. I didn’t want anything to change about this life, not my mom, not my dad. I didn’t understand why, in a country where women are allowed to vote and drive and be teachers, our country would be any other country for that matter: a place where everyone worked their butts off to earn a living, where the government provided for your basic needs and for your basic—the bare minimum—needs—what more do we need in a country? But in America, all that was missing in that year at home was the constant pressure, the constant expectation. I never felt like I missed that. In my sophomore year at St. Xavier, my dad got me an internship at a large electronics company. I wasn’t in any formal training, so it was up to me to learn. I found myself spending a lot of time working on a computer, programming the company’s products—they weren’t that complex at all—and then, later on, helping the customers. That, in a way, was my one chance out—not only was my dad an amazing engineer—he was also an amazing salesman. But the computer science part really didn’t work out for me either; I didn-t really think in those early, low-level programming languages. My mom had me learn to code in C, a language, a system of mathematical equations that I had never thought of. Then she got me a computer science book that explained in a lot of practical details every single bit of programming you could possibly need to get the job done—in fact, I think she got me exactly the right one for that one—the C++ Programming Language. Then she got me a free computer and let me start programming right away. C++ is the language I learned to program in, and I love it. It was a blast. I got to create the worlds best-selling games, movies and, of course, for the first time in many years, a TV show—and at the same time, that’s not an exaggeration—everything from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles all the way through to the newest series on American television was all in a few paragraphs on some text-based program for the kids of America or some other kids show. That was my first foray into a whole new type of entertainment—a whole new market and a whole new way for me to explore that; I don’t know where to begin. I could go all in for an entire episode on how this guy has one of the coolest-looking faces in the world, and there would be no problem for me; if I didn’t know any better, I could just take all of the pictures of it. Or, if I really liked him, I could take it upon myself to make him look as good-looking as possible and then go on my very own personal journey with him for a while. Of course, I didn’t feel like doing that. But that was all I knew: What if, in the best example of what an artist does, the artist doesn and doesn’know any better? What if he was such a genius that he’d just take our place, but in another time-and-place so far, far outside our realm of possibility, we had to create for our own sake, that he wouldn’t be anything more than a stepping stone or a stepping stone on the way back? What if I weren’t as smart as a computer, and what if, one day, another person was so amazing and talented—they were my future—and I couldn’t do anything with my time that they asked me to take it on? What then? What would it be? I could be as brilliant as that genius, or so much better? It didn’t change anything because, no matter what kind of genius I was or what kind’s they were, if their genius—or, more importantly: Their will to be great—doesn’t match mine, I could not change their minds about anything. So, I had two choices: Either I would give up my dream and become a lab assistant, or I would create my own. The second choice would have been a lifetime of mediocrity—a lifetime of mediocrity. And the third choice in life is this: Do you take this, my friend? Do what I did? Do you give it your best chance? What youve got here is not what you ever could have. It isn’t like I got anything in return for all—I got nothing in return. What I got for giving in is all I needed: the confidence of a leader, the respect of a leader, the love of a leader—and that, my friends, is what we need in the world. I can do this, or I can do this, and I am not going to do it differently. Because I know what it takes to be the best and that it never ends. I know what it takes, and it never ends for that. My dad was my mentor when it came to everything and everything, in the classroom, in life. He saw it all—and he’d do something about it. But I wasn’t going to take it—I was still going to be like, You can be whatever you want to be. I could be what I wanted to be, and he’d be like, This is no problem, man; it won’t stop until the day we get married. Forgive me, I need a second chance. But—this time, at least—I was going to do it the right way: in life, in the music, and even in this life. I am going to be, in this time, what our generation of young people are going to be—the greatest—and I won’T be different, because you will be. And for this to work for this whole lifetime...well, then, maybe we should just get married. If only our country would let us. At least you could have a chance. So I did. But, honestly, you can look all you want to, and you won’t change. So, one summer day, we’ got married, and from then on my mom and her mom—who I knew all along was always going to be a strong and loving partner for my mom—were my family on the other end; my mom being one step ahead of me and my cousin was another—they were my real mentors. This was a nice little world. It was perfect for my dad to have a wife. It wasn’t like he would get divorced, either. The divorce was already, and this world had been so perfect for him. But, you knew—because you knew all along—that this day was going to come, and if his kids got in trouble or went to live in a different home or something, it was just a matter of time before that happened, too. And you did everything you could: the doctor told me that one of his first steps in taking this mangy-wife-with-two-kids roadblock off on the road to the world would have been to get her a divorce. I didn't want that. In fact, I didn’t mind it at all; my dad and I had been together for so long now, I felt like we had an easy relationship. One day we would be so good friends; at least in our time together they wouldn’t be. In that day my dad would never be the same man. We would get in trouble over everything: divorce for not taking the kids; kids for not giving their father the attention he’d been looking for; the police beating him for not protecting his family in some kindof war. I was in the hospital ward, not one minute later the next the hospital would be occupied by another tragedy of that type - a terrorist attack, another terrorist attack on another city, another terrorist attack. Then they would be back in a day; the next day it would all be over and done, and I’d got out. But I wasn. No, my dad would never let me. I wasn’t allowed into any of the places where the privileged and the rich had their houses; I wasn’t allowed into any of the places where the people of Africa had their land; the roads were smooth and the people were friendly. The only thing for sure in that part of Africa was that we were all just like them...and that it was our right to exist where we were... in our own special, separate, small, special country, our own, unique land, not like the big city or anywhere else. But in the moment I was in that hospital, I had this terrible thought about what that would mean. What would that mean? Would an ordinary day become a national tragedy? We wouldn’t even have the slightest chance of a normal day in America? The next morning, the news came that a terrorist had killed more than a hundred people on a weekend in a country that’s one of the most peaceful and relatively peace-loving on Earth; that day became a national tragedy; on the following day, the news was that a man with a hatred of the West, of the West, had killed in a massive terrorist attack on a city that’s home to one of the most liberal and progressive parts of my homeland. I grew up in a very, very liberal, very democratic country of ours. I remember everything that had happened since the day the bombs went off. It was a Saturday the first year I went to France for a holiday on a Sunday. I got on at a time and a place I hadn’t been in a while. If I had to describe the country today, I would say it would be: the most secular, the most religious-motivated country. It has no official religion, and at any given point in time every country in the world is in a state of conflict with some other country for their religious or political reasons. Our country is, on the whole, a very religious country. I learned that at school — in fact, every time I went abroad to visit, I learned it from the people. I saw everything, lived it, experienced it, lived it from my very first day on the island. I had a complete blast. By that point in time all that had changed, and by then even though I hadnʙt left for France, the people of France could justifiably be seen by their neighbors to America not as people who were different but as Americans who could live in peace — not as people so different from us that they looked down on us and treated us like second class citizens. It wasn’t just me in France who came away from these holidays understanding the world from a different perspective — everyone came away from them with a whole new appreciation for life. A whole new appreciation of life. I learned that there wasn’t a perfect race. People weren‸t perfect. I learned that our different cultures weren’t perfect either. But my life had been one long, random mishap, the kind of thing that happens all the time. And as much as I didn’t like it, I never gave any thought to the fact that in that time I could have changed anything. If I was a different person, then the one thing I know is — it was never going to be like they were going to give me a second chance; they weren’t the people who were going to give me every opportunity to succeed. They had a system that called for me to succeed and they taught me how to succeed, not me. If I was going to change, then my whole life would change with that. If they were going to change, then mine would change. But my father, this man who treated his daughter like any woman he knew — this man who treated her like any woman he knew — the thing he taught her was, if there was anything she needed, he’d give her a call. There were times a week or two I thought maybe something wasn’t right with the world in general, in her family. Maybe I was the worst. But the thing about her dad as a father — what was I doing here? What in his world did I do wrong? The only thing that I did wrong was tell him everything. This man would have me be everything; my mom as everything: our house, the people around us. It was his way,his home; my dad was in that home every day from day after day. But that's not how he was. This was a world that did not treat its people that way, and in that world, it never got better. My dad was a man with dreams, and in that world that man had a dream he could be. His life was his ambition—and so was ours. But when it came to making an honest-to-God sacrifice, he knew that the real sacrifice would be the hard, sometimes frustrating struggle with the people who loved us less than he did: My dad, as an American, is a patriot who has fought his whole life to defend his country. I can tell him this—he would walk me through the history of that country, the struggle to protect our homeland, the sacrifices that have been made in the name of our country on both sides—and he would tell me how he has never once let those moments of weakness give him the comfort he needs to get back up in the fight. So the next time an attacker steps out onto the street and starts running, he will know exactly where he will be in just a moment. That man would be my hero not just a moment later. And if the shooter is an enemy, the man in blue will know right away that his best chance to win is by showing the world exactly what he is capable of. This could be it. I have all the right weapons—and the time to use them—and my dad would be the only man in a million-dollar conflict in this country for the life of me. But I don't know whether or not he would ever allow me to have anything but the skills and equipment that he has. If he were a man who cared more about winning than winning himself or his country, he would spend more money developing a perfect-weapon system for our defense. But the thing that gets in the way—the thing that keeps us from being—that's what makes America great…that's what makes America great is that everybody comes together and makes the best of it. That's what America does—and is—the best at. And that man cannot be a leader because he would know how to lead from behind. He is my hero, and my enemy, my greatest enemy, is the man who wouldn’t lead from behind at all—the leader, the man of action, the man of action; all the rest of us need someone to step up, and we need somebody to do the hard work of it—and that’s me. It never ends. If I could do it all over again, I would take all my time, effort, and money, and make history, and I’d be the greatest country in the history of…and…it would be my last. I would never spend it on anything but what I really wanted and needed for myself. I would go to all the trouble of building a small house on a small piece of land that I didn’t know anything about, then leave it all behind because the next house I wanted, the next small house I needed was a lot to do. In the summer—the summer—I would stay at the front line all summer. But in the fall, all of the sudden the whole thing falls apart. The government doesn’t give a damn if it’s a government. This is not a civil war. This is a war. And if it’s a war, our men will be in the front lines and our women on the frontlines all along! I wouldn’t let my kids go into that war with anyone else—and they wouldn’t have to. I loved them, and if it was for something else, what in the world would they be doing? They could be soldiers—and all of a sudden I’d have a friend with no friends, who felt like he was the only friend in this world. But at least they would get an experience, and that should teach them some valuable lessons for the rest of their lives—and for that it’s their due. But that was never the plan—the plan was always for my kids to have a normal childhood, stay in a house with a normal family, and then go off and be heroes in some other imaginary conflict outside this one imaginary conflict…This was never going to be like that. It was never gonna be like that. No, this was never going to be like that. My mom would tell me it every day in my childhood. “Don’t worry, your best friend won’t be in the game for much longer.” “Your best friend didn t win the game for very long at that—not for very much time atleast.” “But in an hour you were gone, so what? What happened?’ You don’t know. I don’t care. You can come back with your friend.“Let us play again! We did—in a minute! He couldn’t believe it. I was not one of those people who played in a big game every weekend. I was more of a weekend guy—like, I just had an afternoon of fun, didn’t expect anything in the way of a big deal. I just went to the store. It wasn’t a big deal. We bought some candy at the store. They got it to us from a candy store down the street. I took an apple and I went to school. I learned everything I know that I ever needed to know about how to get my brother any kind of love at any level. He got in trouble. My mom thought it would be a good thing to do if it could have been fixed. She’d taken the time to fix it, and it could have been fixed. But it’s not, because that doesn’t happen to most people. People don’t have kids and they don’t deal with that kind of shit all the time. In the middle of the night my mom would wake me up, and I’d be up, ready to go back to sleep as my sister was getting ready to take her leave of home. I went to bed around one, then two, then three times, just to sleep, like I was never a kid ever since the day my mom was a single mom. There wasn’t anything in particular I didn’t like about growing up in this family. There wasn�t anything that had become a problem, something that was holding us back. I got what most families get —a good-natured, easygoing, family, which is just one of the things that makes them—and I got what most people get —a lot of that and nothing much more; there are some things you can’t live with. They take it upon themselves to fix the problem. My mom never spoke of it in any way. I didn’t talk about it with anybody. The problem was that it wasnt what my mother was all about, so when my brother went off to college he wasn’t the person I needed in my life. The problem was that my parents would never let him leave alone to be his own person. The problem was that when he wasn’t around to be a man—and that wasn’t the case in his life because he was a man with a woman. His life is his own, and his career isn’s, if he chooses to pursue that. My mom wouldn’t let him do that, either. I don’t consider anything that happened a setback in this life. I was blessed with these people of all colors, all cultures, all religions—and there wasn’t one single one from a minority or a particular religion. In my neighborhood our people were diverse, but in every sense of the word we were white. My cousin, the father of my niece, came to America after a year or two of his childhood back home in Kenya. The only problem was the place. For the most part my cousin grew up with us. I remember the days when I was very little, when my family and people came together, even though my mother and my cousins didn’t know them. They were like a distant cousin family but their relationship at least wasn’t that close to my mom’s. In those years they all stayed close to their villages, my dad’s hometown at Nairobi. There was one other thing I was the best at growing up: Growing up when everyone else was growing up in the suburbs. When the suburbs were growing, when everybody was working their lawns and gardens. I went to school in an area right on top of them. But in those years my school wasn’t like any other school—it was a public, all public school, and the kids had to go to private schools, schools with lots of free time to do stuff on weekends, and so on—and it wasn’t like I got the best education of any kid in this school. In fact, I wasn’t the best student in all of this school—I was the worst in my school. So when we went to a school in one of their suburbs it was an experience in my childhood in another, a year that taught me that people from all over the world can learnfrom each other. One of those schools was this old-time school for kids of all kinds: the rural area of Kenya. These kids were all poor and in need of education in a place that had been, for centuries, not very good at it. The first thing they did when they got here was to spend their free time studying. This was their school. That was their future. They took one class from every three years for a full year—or three years. One class was for history. One class was for English. The rest was for science. I was just in the middle of the pack at this one, which was why I had to take an English class. It didn’t really matter how good a kid was at English; the teacher was the one who taught the class, and if you were good at it that was the way to be. So at least in Kenya, I got a little something. In America in my own life I had a lot of what I wanted: a big family and a big place at the table for everyone to hang for a little while—at least that was the only option in this town. In America, you couldn’t be that. You lived in a big house and you worked in a big company. I didn’t. I had an amazing job, and that was that—nothing more. In America I wasn’t that. In America I had my own little house with my own little yard. I could run my own little business with the money from that. In America I had my own car. It wasn’t any more like my mom, who lived a mile from where I grew up in the city where my grandparents once owned a big furniture store. They never left for a vacation. They never had any children at all. My grandma had a home of her own, but my father and I lived in a small town at the edge of the city, a small town that was still mostly in the colonial era. Our home was a little more than an acre and a half in area. The houses here were all single-family homes and we lived in a little shack on the street. One morning as the sun rose I felt like I was home, as my mother was about to jump out of our bed to help me climb in, all four of my mom’s daughters were already downstairs from me, my younger sister, my aunt and her grandson, my Grandpa, my grandfather. But as time went on my mom never let it get in her way of living her life the way she wanted to. As a young woman, my mom was my biggest challenge. Her first job outlived any of her years of high school—she was the police superintendent at a small police academy in the city of Mombasa, a tiny African country. When we were little kids they used to take us on trips around the country, so as a kid I had a little taste. In one summer we went to a summer camp in the middle of nowhere north of the Zambia border. We went for a swim in the middle of nowhere. For a kid my age, that was no big deal. It wasn’t like there was any other summer camp in the world. But the summer we’ went to Mombasa we spent three days in an abandoned forest in a place called Soweto. The only reason they had a forest for a forest was so they could build a city on it. This place was a small piece of what was then South Africa. This is what it was like to be a guy named Nelson Mandela. There was just one problem: He was a racist. If this were any other country, my dad probably wouldn–t have any problem sending me to live with them, too. But in South Africa I had a bunch of other, more pressing things on my plate. I lived the life on my own—in the city, in the suburbs, at the university—and it was a good, constant reminder of just how much time and energy South Africa needed to get back on track. I didn’t have any friends of mine. I had no family to go out in the woods and live the life, not to mention my dad had already decided he was not the man for me. That day in the city, I got to see the world for the first time in a long time—and I got to meet some of the most amazing people. When the war in Iraq broke out I knew exactly what I needed: a strongman of some sort who would be a great leader for the world, and for my country. In South Africa, I’d be a hero. The guy with the big heart was not going to lead. But I’d be able to get a bunch of friends together and say,“Look, everyone, this is what happens when you don’t have someone at home: you have to go out.” One night my mom had a nightmare. “You are not in heaven.” She’s such a good person. “But there was someone who did.” The other person wasn’t. “No, this is not a story.” No. She needed a reason for it. She didn’t need to explain. The only reason my mom took this drastic measure was just to make sure my dad knew what happened. His family didn’t—or couldn’t. “I won. Here goes nothing! Go buy some candy. There will no longer be any war. There will be no bloodshed! We can live happily ever after.” I wanted to stay with them that much more than anything in this world. I loved them so much. The fact that they had no choice but to leave was what really changed my life, because that was exactly what my mom would do: She’d say no, and she would make things right. For one thing, no matter what happened next, my dad never, ever let this go. The next day my dad received a call. This was the second call from the U.S. in as many months. This time it was another cousin. This time his cousin was in the United States, living out his brother’s moment– That’s when there was real choice. This time my mom had the courage to make it her mission to try to save me in a different way—to be the best version of her father—and make that person feel better—than ever. In many ways the second cousin didn’t know what was happening and just wanted to give us some more life advice. But at least he didn’t try to change our lives for money. He was a guy who did his best to raise us with everything he had and then left us to our own devices, and then he returned. I took this cousin out on a nice summer's day at my house, and it was a beautiful day. The sun was setting, the sea was calm, and the trees in the backyard were still alive but in a very different mood. I got to spend that afternoon with my dad, my older brother-in-law, my aunt-in-law, the uncle-in-law. Then, in another beautiful day, we went out for dinner —that was the only reason I ever went to university, after all, and my dad was such an amazing dad! They were always telling me all the wonderful things I learned there: The best part of going to university was, if at all possible, it’s what you get to do that semester. I got to go to an art gallery, a book store. That’s how you learn. This year I was going to stay at home; the art in my hometown wasn’t really that bad. I was going to get a degree, but the world at least needed my talents to fill those gaps. I wanted to be an actor. I wanted to be a musician. I wanted to be in film. So in that year, after everything else, what did I learn? The world doesn’t need a miracle to happen with another miracle. We can create it, just don’t let it happen. And I liked it! I loved it! I got my first big break working in a restaurant on a Saturday night. A man came over and had a drink for everyone. I had never been in a restaurant before but I’d never wanted to be in any restaurant, so I went in and got my first taste of a real-life bar—a place called The Bar. I felt at home right away. Then I couldn’t stop feeling it. The bar, just three tables down from the road, was a bar and restaurant. The owner, a guy named Tom—not a real Tom—couldn’t even tell me his name. It was all Tomatoni, but in a different language. I couldn’t speak Tomatoni; this was Ticnic—Tyrone, Tic-Tac-Toe, Tic-Tac-Toe. My mom, one of those people who knew what happened in the past, and she never let her kids go through the past, went out and got her grandson to do the same. Tomatoni was an eight-year-old boy who loved football, and as a child I had been able to watch those games with my parents and my brothers—I was a huge football fanmyself—but to get a glimpse into some of life in the real thing, I couldn’t turn on my mom. I knew what that game was. The game of rugby, which my dad wanted for his son when he turned eight, he’d buy my cousin at a garage sale for a hundred bucks. In that day everything seemed perfect: There weren’t any problems at home. We sat together at the kitchen table, watching a little game and going for a little jog around the neighborhood. In that week the family was at a beach in one of Italy’s beautiful islands, which is why I always got to go for a day in one of their beautiful, tropical beaches—the Riviera—and see for myself how much of an island it is and the country it is. But I had another reason for wanting to go on an adventure in the desert of North Africa for a week: I wanted to see what my grandma would do: I felt like I’d gotten an invitation to take my mom-in-law on an adventure. What a dream! It’s not like my mom’s job as a police officer didn’t involve her policing—she had the police. She was in the military. But when she joined the force, she got this promotion, which meant that she was going up against one of the biggest military machine ever constructed in history—a military government—which was the United States of America, a government that could do anything. There were no rules: We just ran around and shot some tanks and fought some sorta war. We couldn’t be called on in front of a camera, either. But there wouldn’t be any problem with me, either. I couldn’t do anything but try my best to try to do one of those military-type things, the sort of thing my mom would get all fired up and be like, “You have no life. Please put this behind you. Your time as a soldier will pass. Please. Please. Please go. I love you, son. I love you and won’t ever be your father.” There would be no problem. Just get my mom out of the way and I could be in another country for a while. It turned into a full-on vacation of sorts as we all went backpacking around North America, visiting places like the Black Hills, the Bering Sea, Canada, Australia—just to the West. It was the most beautiful view of the Earth in my life. All around us was blue, all around them was white, and in the middle was nothing but grass and a few scattered trees. On one of these days we were in a little bit of a drought; I couldn’t walk outside anyplace for more than an hour. Then another day I was at my grandmother’s cottage at home, all by myself, and suddenly, I couldn’t go outside. The second summer in North Africa came and went by without a hitch, and in that time my dad went from being the dad of two to the guy who was the dad of four—and the oldest. His job as director of the African National Army was his first real step into the military; at the time it seemed like a career that would have led to a few days in the front line. And the thing the army taught me at home is that I could be that guy, because I knew what I knew then: My dad loved being a soldier. I knew what I’d learned in the army: If you love that much, you must be the best soldier in the army. If you can do it, you can be that—and that soldier is me —and that is me. That whole experience with the army taught me that you don’t get along just because you are both on the same team or because there was a military-like concept that was the norm. You need to be at odds in life to succeed at the same time, and this army is my chance for that—my chance to be that. But that wasn’t the only thing that got me into an accident—an accident that I don’t regret. My mom left for a job as a teacher-reseminar in the United States, where she was an instructor at a private school. I learned the hard way that there weren’t any other teachers here at home in North Korea; they were all highly-educated, rich white people, and I couldn’t find a job as a teacher to help me become the best teacher she could be while she was at work. I spent my days in the classroom as a second- or third-year assistant for a professor, teaching Englishfor a second or third-year senior class. My primary responsibility at home was helping my mom learn how to run a busy household - with both a kid and her husband. I did all the laundry, cooked the food for the dinner. This was an all-nighter, and while we were at work, my mother got ready for bed. But as we were finishing with it, the kids were back in school. My dad brought me a couple of books; the kids, their teacher was my professor, and I was the only white person in their classrooms. I read a little, and I was good, the last few weeks. This summer, this year would be my chance to make a difference – for the greater good. For this semester, I was going to be the school principal at a small private school, which meant that my salary, my benefits, my pension were going to go to an African American woman, my son-in-law and his three siblings, their families, and everyone else. So I had a lot of time to myself – and I enjoyed every minute of it. I learned all the rules, the curriculum, the history that would make us the perfect blend. This school—this country—would have been perfect for me to be on-call 24/7 for an hour. That's what I'd done my whole life. I could do that every day. As long as it was not a full-day job. And this school would be my second job as a substitute. All I had to do at home was study at home for an afternoon, and then for the rest of the week I would be back at school. And while I didn’t work in a day, I got my hands dirty. I did a lot of hand-washing. I made a lot of cupcakes. The kids at school would come home and make me cupcakes, too. So if they ever wanted a treat, I could have one. It was always the same story: I was on the job all day, then I was off for an afternoon… and then I came home to a whole lot of cupcakes. I could not leave. I couldn. It was always that one moment in the morning when everyone else went to bed, I would wake up early and make one cupcake and one banana for my mom, then one more cupcake, and then another. If she had a craving for something that wasn’t part of our morning routine, it would be our usual morning treat. On weekends, we’d take something we loved from Burger King. That was the only thing I knew—the best burgers—that I ever wanted to eat. ″Oh, no. I need my own. It is not for sale. I need a piece.‹ Yes, there were times I could see myself growing up and going back the way I was…and there was never really the option to change. My father had me on and off for six years. He wasn’t the parent who made it easy for me; he made it hella difficult for me. He would give me everything, I would struggle to get anything in return, and in the end he would pull the plug on his relationship. We were always two sides of the same coin: the good guy, the bad guy…or, in some cases, both. And so, there you were, the two of us in this life—the two most important pieces of my father’s greatest gift—his willingness to spend six months a year as a soldier in the Middle East. And he was my only chance at that. The day my dad called came…and it turned out that in between our parents' divorce, his mother had left the house for work at a computer company; by the time their kids were five and six, they were no longer living at home with their parents. The only other person close to his family was my mom. My dad always said that he knew exactly the way I saw things, and that he was the only person in my life that knew exactly what I felt and did not feel. I wasn’t that different. I felt everything. The fact that he couldn’t change his mind, and the fact that it meant everything to him to spend what was—at the time—a very brief time at his parents' house on a beautiful white beach; the fact that that was the closest thing to an escape from the real world for him all summer; the fact that we lived in an amazing city in a great country on the same amazing island, two great countries in the middle of the ocean; I would never, ever, ever leave, any choice but to get with the program. It was a chance for us to be with a different culture; to start over.And you could tell in every moment of that, for the first time in my life, I was in a new life, a new country—a country of my own. I was so glad to be here. I was the youngest person in my family to grow up in a home where the whole of our family grew up in a single-mother household and we had the same four or five brothers—the same seven or eight generations of that family of 7,000-8,000 people who were the majority of all the immigrants who ever lived in this country. As a child of the Great Depression, I spent my childhood on a farm. But as a child on a farm, you had your father, your older brother, and your five or six older brothers and sisters on the farm selling, growing their own food. As a child on the street, everyone was a farmer all over again. My dad was a carpenter for hire, and I worked on his shop floor, my dad's shop in the middle of town. My dad was a farmer in his own right; there was never a time when there wasn't a plot of land in a field, a hedge or a wooded area, a plot on which to grow a food crop of whatever kind you chose. The only problem with all that was that when one man had all the land and the other man didn’t, there had always been someone left to work the land in the form of a cooperative of farmers who gathered all the crops, and then they planted it back up again. But my dad was the man who was a farmer all his life, and he had his own way of doing it, too. He could be as ambitious as any of his neighbors, but at least this time he didn’t just give away the land—he took the land back in. He let it be his back yard, too, in his own backyard. The people of America had always known that this was their land. They had always been in the land. The fact that a white man had always had such great control of it was just another example of his greatness and his greatness —and their greatness—was never in question. But, to be honest, the only reason he never felt at home in that backyard was because he didn’t feel like he could be in an integrated community with all of the people from all walks of life, people like all the same colors, and people from all different walks of life. I would go years without ever seeing him in America, and at least for my time in the United States, this time around the first thing I saw were the white people. They were the only people in America —and, to be fair, I saw them all the time —they were the only people who were really the white race. In America, they were the white majority. But for some reason in South Africa, America was not the white majority. In South Africa everything went back in time. There was no such thing as modernity; it was all about the past. Everything was white. Everything was white and perfect. The only difference being blacks didn’t live in any houses, didn’t own any land, so their houses were just shacks and shacks. When I was younger, I used to get a lot of the old South African white people to come down and live in a hulking sliver of their country, one-quarter of an island that they called Andalang. It seemed to all be so peaceful, and then one morning the sky exploded into a million pieces. The earth shook, the sky was falling, it was all going to end in an instant as a meteor. Everyone ran for cover in a minute or so, some of them to the ground to escape the shock, others just to get out of there as quickly as possible. No one had time to pay any attention to it. I walked home from school, and the first thing I noticed as a kid at the beach was that the whole thing was all gone. The beach, at least, for the summer. I was an island in time. But by the summer, the whole country outside of this small, little island in the middle of the ocean was completely different. The roads would never be the same, the sky would never be the same, the people would be a whole lot different. In America we never took a vacation; our families would go for years at a time, or we’d stay at one place for a year, or we’d move. But in South Africa we never did. It had been a good year of school, we had never had a problem with school, we had spent our summer vacations in summer and our summer vacations in summer at school—and the entire thingthat year was the happiest thing in my life. The teachers at my high school, my teachers from a different school, my teachers from a different school, they had taken me aside one morning in November and said, “Today, at this school, we are leaving. You are going to go to Harvard. We are going to go to graduate school. We are going to teach your children to be doctors and lawyers and engineers. We are moving to another country. I am leaving my family to raise these children. Please, please, please give me what I need for my children or for my children”—and I know that the man I knew the most from that first semester of his life, the one who loved his family as much as the people he worked with as much as anything, would never let them die on his watch. But I didn’t think it was a big deal. I didn’t think of it as something that we needed to do, at least not in-between our schedules. I always wanted to be out on the town, doing what I loved to do—and the whole thing was the best—while making a difference at the same time. My friends and my classmates and all their families looked up to me as one of them—a role model of the American dream. It never occurred to them that I didn’t have a future as an actor. In some ways it was easier for me at least. I had an amazing connection with actors—and with the people of New York—and I knew how to get them—that they were my friend and my role models, even as a kid. So even when a film came on the big screen in a couple days, my mom, my younger brother, my niece, all said, “No, no, no, we can do that. We need a little more of that. We need a little more of that. Let’s go!‹ All of a sudden—and to this day this was the biggest moment of my growing adulthood—I didn’t feel like it had ever quite happened to me. In the movie I was a kid—the kid—that was the boy who could never learn from failure. The boy who learned from himself. The boy who had to face up to the world and learn a lesson, every single day, no matter what. In the movie it was just me and my mom—the only two in the film, in this story we couldn’t be. It was the only time in years that I felt like my parents were living the rest of their lives. They were on their deathbeds, and their last will and testament was a letter they made, a letter of will they wrote for their son asking him for a blessing as well. What a great father would have done now to take that away from us and give us another opportunity, or a chance to leave that family he could have changed for the better, or something—well, there is no telling who would have taken the time for that. But my dad was a good man, a great father would have done that for his son: he would have done more for him than take the easy way out. I always tried to be a better man. I got myself a degree from Harvard for free (which he never paid back); I worked my butt off to get through the school system at a very competitive university (which I had to prove I could do—I was never the smartest kid in class. I was never the smartest at any of my classes; the best students were those who were the smartest; the hardest in my classes were those where I was the smartest but everyone else was just as dumb as the rest of those days); I went to work every single day, learning from the best, and I did it all in a year and a half and a half, not two. But by then I was in such a good relationship with my dad at least that I could always talk about it, and we went to his house for a barbecue or something and I thought that’d do the trick. I had an idea as to what he needed, an idea, and that would have been a great way to get it. “What is the problem? What do we need to do?” And then my dad gave me his idea and I went out and hired somebody for it, something like that. He was my first real job-review assignment: an assistant—someone with the job of telling me what kind of job to get for him. This guy was my best friend at school—one of my best friends. We spent our days together, after school, hanging out, going to clubs, hanging out, hanging out: Everything in between. He went on a lot, and I tookall the lessons, every once in a while. He didn’t try anything new. He took the same path, or was at least on the same path. My dad was always the one who knew where to go, what to do to get there. He knew what to do, and I had to learn what to do. My mom taught us how to do the hard stuff. She knew the road, and she knew the way that it was going to end up on that road. It didn’t change for her; the road was all ours. I was never allowed to be more interested in this one life, and not in anyone else�s. I was the boy in his time—in my time! If I had an 8-year-old who knew all the important things in life, he wouldn’t have a problem with that. But I don&t have that. He knows all of the little details—his grandmother didn’t have any time for little details anyway; there was not a whole lot of it. My dad taught me how to be the best version of my mom in real-life, too: How to be your mom—a great mom, better, a great friend—for the rest of your life. But my mother would never teach me how to be that, not as a woman; the things I would never teach her would be: How to be a man—a great man—for as long as I can remember; and How to be the greatest, best, most beautiful woman in the world—to be with the most beautiful men in the world. She would always tell me not to be a man for myself, the world, or anything. That would be for my grandpa to do. Her advice to me was: You need to get in the middle. You need to be a man. It was a perfect example of the whole thing: a woman who would, at least one morning, tell me this: You need to be great so the world’s great can be great: She gave the world what it couldn’t have: The greatest sports team in the world would never have a chance. I knew the one time this woman did that I was in for an amazing moment right away. I was so happy for her. But to think it would come at such a young age, all for this—this—just to be one of those things I would never want to be. This woman in that moment—and I didn?t get that about her all the time—she would say I’d do something right in life. I always thought of today as one big opportunity—and in that day it was no exception. For the first time in a long time, all I knew as a kid in the summer of '90, the summer after my mother lost her mother, it wasn’t a struggle. I felt—I felt like all the problems in my life were within my control, and my only choice was to live in a house or get out, to try to fit in, or I could go live the life of a nomad. I could walk the streets in this city of great contrasts. Here, I could be my mommy's best friend in a city full of her worst enemies. Here, I could try my best to take care of my dad, a man who would put his life on the line for just about everything except his daughter. But here was a guy who, instead of looking out for his own, looked out for the needs of the people around him. I saw my dad in another man in another country, my brother-in-law in another country, my aunt, in another country, but as an 18-year-old boy I never had a chance to learn how to be like them because of a single mother. The moment her job ended she and her daughter, their son, found themselves a job at a small electronics retailer at the end of the road from their house, barely scraping by on the minimum and working very, very hard. They loved it—they’d done more than all of us could ever dream of doing. But for some reason this woman gave it all to them, and they couldn’t live in an apartment at any price: This woman couldn?t be the breadwinner of their kids? This woman couldn​t be this person? You had to be the person who knew what a great father can­not do, who knew what a great mother can do. You needed to be the person who could have your back. My dad was the best in my life. He treated me with everything that a parent ought to – love, respect, kindness. The problem with his relationship with his mother–it looked likeit was never going to improve. The relationship was always on fire. Everything from fights to fights. There was never any peace. We never spoke of it. Then one evening we were talking about our lives—we were having a little dinner at a nice restaurant, and my dad came out, totally drunk on whiskey. Our conversation turned to one of his favorite movies, another masterpiece by a great director, another great movie that everyone should see. My dad said something to the effect of, We used to go to see it in a theater. When we were young, we'd go, and as a kid we were both really into that movie. A friend and I went and bought it for our mom. It cost $8; today, at least in the States, it costs just under a dollar. But now here in Africa, there are theaters for that movie every weekend to go and see it. In some African countries that theater is the only way people have to see movies. But in this one, there were no theaters. Every Friday night, there were people sitting at home, their parents and their grandparents, their grandkids; they could go in and watch the movie, or they could go out and have a drink or something in a bar, but there was no one in the street around to see it. So the whole family went out to see it on one of those big weekends. This time the theater was bigger and better, with more seating to sit in; we could all just sit down for an hour, a pint of Guinness for our morning coffee. But this year, on this Friday or Saturday morning, the only people who were out on the street were the people in the bar; they had a little dance party. Everybody was having a good time, and then all of a sudden there was this huge explosion. Then the next, a second huge explosion; then, all of a sudden, a third. And then, all of a sudden, there was this huge fireball. I don’t remember how fast it was, because that, for me, it happened so fast that I don’t know how it stopped or stopped at all. I remember the fireball, it all happened so fast. It didn’t even take two seconds. My mom would have called the fire brigade to put it out or something. But she didn’t do any of that, because she knew better: The smoke, the fire, the explosion. So my mom came to my younger brother inlaw, who came to my mother, who came, and they did. One by one, the firetrucks came. And then, at a certain point, the firemen came. But as the firetrucks were bringing them, my mom was the first to run to help her son, who had a difficult pregnancy. “They don’t know what to do. They won’t do anything.‹ That is, my mother had seen the doctor. She believed this. She knew better, because as a practicing physician, she knew that this woman had an obligation to give her son the best care she could. What was that in the middle? In the middle –what was that? That wasn’t happening? The doctor called the hospital, the midwives, a pediatric surgeon. This woman wanted to do something about her child. But it was only a chance to do something different. And my mom wasn’t going be that, either. The way things worked in this country, my dad was the president. If you wanted your son to get an engineering degree and the president of the United States wouldn†t accept his recommendation, that wasn’t going to happen: You’had a problem. That wasn’t what he was. They were two sides to the same coin. But this woman was the president of the United States, and this man had just been impeached for something that was a far worse violation of the Constitution than the one on which he served. How many times did this woman have a miscarriage in her family? How many times had her husband been caught in a sex scandal? I wasn’t allowed on with anyone but him. My parents didn’t want me at his side, so there wasn’t an option for me either, except that the guy had a huge advantage. “You don’t ever want your father as the president,” he said. “No, I need you to be the one.” “Don’t be too nice. It’s not that I didn’t know any better; it was the way it was. You have a great country, and I don’t want to live in it. But I can livein the city where I can be and do all of the things the majority of the people can do if only I could be like them. My mom taught me that; I learned from her. But the problems in that city—the inequality—were things that the police could solve; my dad could fix the roads, and my mom would be up all night fixing my house. But I wasn’t—and this was the thing that made me hate my dad for so long—that it wasn’t my fault; it seemed to me like my parents were trying to fix all of these things for me, and in some ways, I was just the scapegoat for their failures. In the days leading up to our wedding, I had to confront this dilemma over and over again. How can I be a part of this family, without doing what they wanted and getting what they didn’t want? It was a constant struggle as I tried to decide. On one hand, I knew it wasn’t that simple; on the other hand, I knew it would just be another thing we were doing to our family: The perfect picture of everything that was great in this country. On the one hand, I knew that I could be the dad in their life. On the other hand, I knew that this guy, this woman wouldn’t be the woman in my life. It wouldn’t be anything except for love and attention. And on the other hand, I knew the only way to change that was for me to do something. So for three years—and then, three years longer—I was the guy in their life. That was all I could do. When we started dating, at least for me, in our 20s and 30s, the only options with any sort of love and commitment that was real were to get married off or stay together. We decided one could never go wrong, right up until the very end, so at least that was it—the ultimate in relationship. But for the first time I got a real moment of truth. I got the chance to be with something really special. It was a beautiful moment for me, of a woman with a heart, and it wasn’t like I had a choice. When I met my future wife, I knew what a special couple I was going to be. I knew what a special woman was going to be to be in my life. I knew what an amazing thing to do when people’ need their help. But for the first time in so long—all the time my mum and my dad and I were working to build this amazing, incredible company as our own—I had the chance, on my own—to make a difference. So that, by the way, is one of those times in life, when everything is about the moment—now. And if you can wait for the moment, and then it never comes, you should have waited, because that’s the moment you need to catch up. If things go just right; if you’m the man to step in and take a backseat as the woman—if you have to be a man and be in charge, and you can be in charge as well, there’s a good chance you won. But if you are the woman—and the woman must be in charge, right up to the very end—and you can be in charge, and you can be in charge at the same time, there just won»t be a woman who could be that. So I was the woman who stepped in—and, let’s not be honest, she never did. There wasn’t a reason for me to be, at least from the beginning. The first thing I knew when I met my wife, my cousin, my son: There couldn’t have been a better partner for me in all of this—or to be more specific, for all of my problems, this relationship was my answer and the solution. I was always the guy who would be the boss. We would take control, and we were the ones with the power. But in this world these days, I didn’t think that would be so. A lot of things about this country have changed in three decades; I don’t think anyone knows that better than me. Here in America, we have never been more free than today. We have never been more confident; we take such pride in ourselves—and in each other. But here in America in this country, where we had to learn to be slaves for our masters—we weren’t the free ones yet. I saw it in the newspapers when these terrible things happened every day, and they werenjust some random freak thing from another world. There were stories of black slaves trying to escape the plantations of Africa—the British plantations on the other side of the continent, where they worked the land and raised cattle. Black people on the other side—the South African farms and livestock!—the land of our ancient ancestors! But there hadn’t been any rebellions—nor a mass uprising—in the South African countryside—a rural region in the heart of the American South—yet I knew that if black people tried anything like that it would be considered racism on a whole new level, the sort that only the most hateful people would be proud of. This was my first, my last chance to be a part of history. But all I did know is this, all I ever wanted to learn was, “What does a black person do?” There wasn’t one. I wasn’t even allowed to learn the names of the black people that my mother taught me how to be. The only black people that were on the news were the ones who were the most in need of our help: people in need of our lives, but we couldn’t take their place as our own. It didn’t matter what country they lived in or where they came from, they were the most important people on the planet, people on whose face I would be forever changed. But at least I could learn from them: I was an outsider in their life. “But,‸ he said, “that just means, there were still people who’couldn’t learn.” ‹I just thought there came a point in time when we could learn,‘ that it was okay if we just learned’and then move on and get on with our lives, ‹it wouldn’t matter.‹ And I could learn from that lesson. Maybe I could be one of them. This was the middle of a generation of black people coming of age in a nation of white people. So if this weren’wouldn‚t be the greatest generation in my lifetime I don’d be a statistic, like it had never happened. But the only way I could ever live up to my mom’s expectations as a black man in America would be one day to move to a country that was like the black majority country in the west, where I could take over, take their culture, and change their culture for my own. After all of that, this country would just have to accept my new people’s new way of life and try it out. I didn’t know what a country was before I was born. But as a black man in the United States of America my life was like no other. Even before I had any of the best schools in the world, my dad took me into his world so he could teach me how to be a man—everything from where you live to how much money you can make when you are in college to how to be a success in whatever endeavor it was he took you under his wing as a businessman. So as a five-year-old kid my dad went to an all-American school with great teachers as well as great students and was the teacher of almost all of them—but for one reason or another that school was not for him. It was for people like himself. My dad, a great man, took on his mom, the greatest woman on the planet. He never let her go. He took the day off, then came home. When she returned from her tour of duty in Iraq to be with her husband and her family in a hospital, my dad chose them for a special day of his. In that day at the hospital, no one came down from the sky for us. Instead we had a small memorial at their garage in front of our house; a giant replica of their home. That was our only home—a small, white house—and the only reason we lived in it at all was because of the money in it; my dad wasn't allowed to own another thing or have anything that moved or touched us. But my mom and my younger sister and me—my mom was an entrepreneur on the side—the only thing in between us was our time and our money, not my mom’s. We had a garage, and so our garage was our home. My mom would take us for walks around town, and then I’d be off at work, running errands, doing other things. But in the car, it was my dad who taught me how to be a man and take charge in every situation. I learned how to be a man from him. He taught me everything I know, and then heleft me with a question: What does a man do without a man, without a woman? I never got an answer, even after years of working in a factory and working a minimum wage job. A woman would come along and take the place of that. I learned how to be the man on my own. That was all I knew—and it was not that long after that that I learned from my childhood that any woman has a right to be as much as one-half of the man on her own. But my mom had another thing for her. It was my first real experience of what a woman's place was in America. The next thing I knew—an army of American soldiers came out from North Korea to liberate us from its dictator. I could no longer see a woman in my father's Army—I could see a man with my father—an enemy fighting on the side of our side, with no regard for their country, their honor, just for our money. If anything happened to that man he was the enemy—and the only thing that ever mattered to him in any way was, "Do what I tell you and you will get your country back!" That was all he said. My dad and I never spoke to each other about that war for years—the next one was another chance for us to learn. But for the first time I felt like I was learning something new—something I wasn’t supposed to know. In fact, I knew for years that it wasn’t a lesson my dad would ever learn. He had been the best general in the world when he left the Korean War for the Persian Gulf War—then became an officer and a general in his own right. He didn’t teach me many, if any, of his lessons while my dad taught me about it—but he did teach me a few. The other thing he taught me in the Gulf War—even though it wouldn’t last, the war on terror had just begun in Saudi Arabia—is that people can learn from mistakes. When you live under the constant threat of attack by the most powerful nation in the world for 10 months, you learn to be a little more resilient than a lot of those who came after. You learn that there are times when the United States is the best defense against that threat—and at least we know what we need to do to protect that. And there are times, though, when we really need to be the best defense in the world. In that moment, in those months before this terrible attack and in the days immediately after—what if a terrorist attack happened to be a false flag? My dad told me to get ready—to get ready. He was so concerned about the fact that this woman would think if things didn’t go her way that for the first time it was him, like a knife through butter, that would bring down the entire world. In some ways I took a lot of comfort in that. I knew that the world was as dangerous as it could get even before the attack—what was the point of fighting for my country when the terrorists in the Middle East would kill people for the sake of their religion? So I went with it, as the world needed it. At least I got myself out of there alive, for the next two years at least. But that day in June, June 6, 1993 was not my day; my day was not the day it was supposed to be; my day was not going to change. The day of the attack my dad was in his car with his kids when it was in motion—and as the car began to spin—he could feel it, the acceleration, the suddenness. I was only eight years my senior when we first moved here to a town on a desert island—my father took us from one place to another. We moved to the mainland for our first family farm, and here we were living in a trailer park, the very land we were supposed to be farming and raising our own food. And then there was that other thing: I was a farmer. As a kid, my father would have us pick some of the best vegetables and other produce from the local fields; he would send us our own backyards, where he would grow his own vegetables; he would give us a place to put our barn; I would come and pick the apples. For my dad, this was his moment of true freedom: His backyard. The second of our kids was born in a small village in a small patch of land—it was the first place my dad did the same for us from the beginning—and we had another house, a small plot of land. But there were no cows, no chickens or pigs or anything that could support any kind of livestock on their own. My dad could be a little strict whenit came to that and I would get in all kinds of trouble—he would say I didn''d do my chores too well, or I was a failure—but that was no reason for him to take my place. That would just mean the problem wasn’t mine—that it was something that had to be fixed, something that the people had to deal with. If it wasn’t, maybe they would have. But it was our living, and our kids were our safety, so I went outside for an afternoon to play in the garden. My dad worked his whole life, so he knew what kind of plants to grow and how to care for a garden. For an afternoon, I grew a little bit of whatever. Then I walked back into his office. We had been through so much together in the time that it was just me and his. I had always been a kid in a boy's' boy world: we’d walk in, play, meet up, hang out—and then he'd come back to his office and tell him all the details of their day. I never thought I’d have it any other way. Every Sunday in the summer my father would take me to go see my grandma's wedding in Las Vegas—I didn’t know anything about it—and if that wasn’t enough, he’d take a trip on his private jet. But that Sunday in May, my dad was out of town for a vacation, so I wasn’t in any pressure to do anything at all. It was a great year for me to be a kid in a boy's city. So, I wasn’t that excited or anything. I got on with my studies and went back to class. But that Saturday, I knew what it would be like for all of us to be one big family in this amazing country of ours. If we had to live on a diet, we would have one big family. Not like any family on earth. It was all so simple. So simple, in fact, that for the first time in a while I didn’t feel that the people I knew—the real-life family—were all that special—only some people, but they weren’d be the exception and the rule, for the most part. They would all be like, okay. It didn’t change much for me, either—I was still in love with my cousin, and my cousin didn’t like anyone—but for a brief moment I felt like the whole thing had changed for the better for my cousin. That, I had seen them through the trials, through the obstacles in their life, and in a way that I never had for anyone else. I didn’t need them any more—they had all the support I needed from that point forward—but for a moment in time I felt like the world looked a lot different: in a different way, in a different time, in a different culture, in a different language, in a different way of thinking; and in all of that time I had the privilege of growing up with them, like everyone else. That, to me, was the best thing about being adopted: You get to grow up with them and be one of them. That was my first real introduction to this incredible community: I was adopted to an all-white, all-male family. They had a white doctor. They’d take his advice to have him circumcise them. They’d run a white-only high school soccer team. And, of course, they had a white doctor who looked after all their health care. The white doctor, at least on those days, was my doctor. The white doctor was a very handsome, tall, white man. And he was a very handsome doctor. But at least he was a doctor. In America, people with that kind of medical knowledge are often the first and last line of defense in saving someone—like in this story, the white people of South Africa took the chance by coming to their aid when their white neighbor got himself in a very serious car accident and they had to step in and save their lives, and in our culture at least, they got the boot. This may not have been the first time an innocent white family came under fire from white nationalists, from white supremacists, or from some other white supremacist group—it just may have been the first time a white family came together to help a white woman survive what could have been a very real and very dangerous act of terrorism. I never forgot that. When it happened, all I knew is that I had my father. I didn’t have a father. I knew what he was like: the guy was the patriarch of the family and would raise his kidsHe was always around; I always had his back. But that was before my cousin, the other cousin, who was one-third my brother, died one year before me. I had an aunt and a aunt. These people were not that well known, especially by the younger generation of the family. I didn’t think of them as my parents. I knew them for a few years as a small part of the extended family. They looked out for each other, but they had so much to do all their own that it wasn’t their place to be. They cared for their own—and their son’s—responsibilities, too. I had a great connection with them all these years—I grew up with them in some ways, too, but that relationship was the only connection on this earth to some extent—but my father didn’t seem particularly interested in that. My dad was very nice, but he never wanted to let it come across that we were more than friends, that he wasn’t that close. There were times where I felt like he took it upon himself to show me how important it was that I never give my dad the credit he deserved. He taught me to be a man: that his life was my life and mine, in a thousand ways. I had a lot of things that I never did as a kid to earn his respect. I was just a complete child, the whole year of grade school. Every time he said something nice, I was like, Here, man, now you know what an incredible gift we have. Here, take this. I had to be a man to earn his respect. But on the other hand, when everything else was going wrong, my dad did what any reasonable person would do: He took a stand. This guy wasn’t a leader. At home. At school. At work. My dad always said that when you get a little older and you know what life looks like, you make your own choices. If that is your choice, I feel like it was mine to make. But that didn’t mean that his life didn’t change with it. The one thing that he made me realize from the time I was a small boy my world would never be that small. The bigger and better things I knew of his life—what a great man he was; one of the greatest leaders in the history of the world —would never change our lives in any significant way. Because this country has always been a great country for the rich—the one that gives you everything, no matter what your level. I wasn’t going to change, because this guy knew all the right things. He wasn’t a politician. In fact, he went around the country in his time as the head of a business—the world. I didn’t need to learn those things in school. I could learn them all over again, and I could learn them all over again, and every time the world needed a boost it wasn’t me. He knew the answers when the world needed a boost. But at least now I had one thing he knew from a man in his life about the best job in the world, I’d have time to do some of the same. It didn’t matter that for my birthday I was going to a doctor for an endocrinological test. At least I’d get a chance to meet the man I loved; I had a chance to hang out with him all those years—and meet some other amazing people who would have done me a huge service if I didn’t have the cancer—that was enough for me. I got it—but not on the day of—I’d be at the doctor's office for an endocrinological test. That was not how cancer treatment worked in my state. It wasn’t what we’d done all our lives. I didn’t think the doctor had any business doing such an important and controversial research trial; it was like the cancer was a problem that the doctor would never be able to solve. He was the person who came up with all the answers. I had to take a test, to be sure. For his birthday, my mom took me to see the world as part of the scientific community—the universities. But this wasn’t a university—this was a research university. We didn’t have labs or labs for scientists, or for anyone, really. It was this university of medicine, which was a bunch of doctors and researchers all working on things. We went, by bus, down to the campus, to the hospital's main building—this big, white building. I saw everything—the university campus, the maincampus, the hospital—and the surrounding countryside. There was nothing but trees and grassy green hills here—the kind that are the real thing you hear in the city or in the suburbs, but nothing more. In the distance I could see the sea and the city of Isfahan, and in the middle of the ocean there was the ocean. For the next half hour—I was in some sort of suspended animation—I couldn`t move. I couldn’t talk. What happened next I never did understand—and probably never will—is I never learned anything from the experience. After the accident, my whole world changed. At least, for a week. Then—a week later—I started to get better. Everything. My hair, my skin, my fingernails—now—here I was, an average guy. This guy was the best-looking person in school, and the best-looking girl in class was actually a black person? The world changed. For the first time in a while it was true to life, and I felt like I had a purpose in life. I learned the values of compassion, responsibility, and service. The lesson in life? If it wasn�t for you, I wouldn’t be at all alive. As time went by, and this guy was no longer my friend or my teacher, it all kind of became a burden; all the time in the world, all the time needed in my life for my kids, for the work I didn�t have. My mom would call to ask, “How can I be of any use to you?” So here is the answer—I had a job. I could go and do the work and still not have to do my homework. Her parents might have to do it, too. It didn’t matter. We lived our lives as though our whole lives consisted of the constant, endless struggle. I could go and work in a factory, I could be a factory worker in a factory. I could go to a factory and do some of this, some of that, and I would be paid—and I would get paid—well below the minimum wage. The only problem was, I didn’t think that was going to be the life for me ever since grade school. My dad worked his whole life in this factory, and I never went near it in my younger years. It didn?t feel like the world. “This is what I was all along, in this factory. In this factory I could go to school; in this factory I could learn; in this factory I could make things here on Earth. That?that?that?that didn’t make any sense. This?this?This?this must have been the most amazing thing you have ever seen in your life. You couldn?t imagine life without it. My dad would go one day, and, what was even more amazing to me, the next day, he would be in another car accident. When he did return to the factory, he did it in a different time and in a different place and I never forgot the time he did that. So when I graduated from high school with a degree in engineering, the way the system was set up at the time I looked back on that time I had no choice but to act as if I didn’t exist. This is what happened at MIT, this is what happens at the University of California, this is what happens in America at the moment. These people aren’t even allowed to be in the same school year after year after year? This is who I am? This is what my entire life will be about? “You don?t know anything. You need to learn English for a year in that place. It is not like I can go back in time. That was forty years ago, and you need to learn English just as your parents did, not just for this one semester. But it was a time, a choice: The United States of America versus another country, or another culture. And as a boy in a different culture, my parents couldn’t give me an accurate picture of what this place was all about. They couldn’t tell me the history and the people and the place, because they could not live inside it. My mom would have the answers for me. When I left home for college, it was my first year at a large university, the prestigious Harvard University. I took a class, and the next thing I knew I was sitting in an auditorium with people from all over the world—people from all over the world to learn from one another in one place in one year, in one place as a whole. It was a chance for me tomeet those people and to go up against them for a year in a row. At that point in my life I was very much atypical: not a student with the academic requirements to go to Harvard, and not just to get a degree, either, or a bachelor's degree, either. In the middle of nowhere in a very, very small village. But, at least I knew I could be what I loved as a kid: a musician, an actor, an entertainer—and so could everyone else. I had all those things; I just knew what they were not—and I could learn along the way from them. At that point in my life I was living as the single parent of a single person in a very small village in a very, very small, very remote part of this vast, wonderful country. And as a single person in a very, very small village, I was the only black man living with my parents. That small village didn’t have running water or electricity, and there was no running water from one house to the next. I could go out for a run, walk for an hour—and then be back in my house by myself, just as I hadn’t left. I could go for a run in the yard from one house to the next, or I could play in the yard from one house to the next, or I could be out for a walk, and it wouldn’t be a problem. We knew that the grassy knoll along the road was our backyard—our backyard. You could walk on it for miles, so there was no need to dig as far as the ground in. At some point my parents and our sister and my younger brother—my cousins—would come from the village and live in a shanty in the middle of nowhere. There was nowhere for them to take a bath, a toilet, a kitchen, or anything—nothing but a roof in the middle of the woods. We lived in an igloa, which is basically a huge flat-topped hillside, and so the one part of town we lived near was a large park with a beach and a beach. In the middle of the park, my cousin and his brother lived, and my cousin lived in a hut on a hillside, right down the road. As a kid, my cousins lived off the land, so if everything went well the house, but this time it wasn’t a perfect deal; the problem was that my cousin would live on my father's land. My father would buy my cousin the land, build a house for us, and leave. Then my wife would take her cousin back into his homeland and live a small village life. They would be like that now, except they lived outside the city. In the village, there was an old man who could help anyone with a problem. In the house, in the garden, in the yard. In other words, in the village, I felt like I lived in this incredible, wonderful place—in this incredible place of people, of love, of adventure, of people from all over the world! But what made this village so special was that it was my first taste of a new world: the American Dream. In the United States we’d move from one extreme to another in a day, from one extreme to the next. From the big houses to the small houses all our life there were only a few of us in our tiny, shantytowns, our yards and fields, our yards, our fields—this is what we called home. But I learned a lot of things about life at home in America at an early age. I learned to like it—not in that way you would learn to be a rebel in a man, where it was all going to happen to you, that you were going to be like the great hero; in America at least there was always something to be rebel against. To be honest, my dad knew what he was doing from the start. I was not a good student in either school. When he told me, in a meeting that I wasn’t supposed to be there—and he was right—he was right: I got a failing grade in the social studies section of school, so he came up with an idea: He was going to take me to America to visit some of his favorite places, and he’d give me all the money—his whole life savings, in fact—and he’d give me everything. He was a real man of money. In America, there wasn’t a market for that. So that day, instead of going to college or going to the military academy, I went right into a job at General Motors: the company, the company, was my next step, right beforeI became a millionaire of some kind. It was a great deal: starting at a flat rate of $2,500 a month for two years, I could be in my parents' backyard, enjoying the fruits of their labor for a year or two; a year of that would be like going from nothing to $1,000 in a month. But from there, as my parents began to struggle to put food on the table to support their families, that second year at General Motors would be the year they were going broke on their own. By then my stepfather already had his own car—his mom had sold it. But at least he could take me out for dinner with him and his family at one of their restaurants. And in my home, my mom and my stepfather were always one step ahead of the rest of us: we were the kids of the privileged white families in America, and we were all very close; there was no need for us to ever leave the suburbs or stay in the city. In fact, my dad would often tell me, with a straight face, that when the white majority of a community decides to leave the suburbs and move to another part of the country…they move in with us. He had never been in an Asian-American-American neighborhood so he'd never met a single person named Chinaman in his lifetime. That was the thing: My dad was not like any other white person in America; he was the opposite: He was an outsider, and the people he encountered were not: They were Chinese or Chinese-Americans. These were not ethnic enclaves; these were places in the middle of nowhere. But my dad saw that and understood what was happening—it was the only way forward: he became my dad's guide, my dad's life guide—and he turned my life around. When he got married and settled down with his second wife, he started a new life for himself: a comfortable, comfortable life, with all the comforts of a nice house, a car, a nice vacation, the kind of thing that I look back on as the perfect thing. His first wife, on the other hand, came out of nowhere: a kid with no education, no time for a man; a woman who only wanted to be with her boyfriend a lot of the time. After the kids were born, they had to be separated. They were going to have to go off to live with their cousin's family. At some point they were going to have to split up and move. This man…the world has changed. Now my mom is the breadwinner and he is the breadwinner and he is the provider. We are at the pinnacle of the American Dream, and yet at that point in time my dad could be the greatest story of all: an American success story, with the skills and the work ethic of a great success story, only his father, as a workingman's dad, did all that for him. At least then he was doing something in his spare time. Then in 1995 I learned this new word – the term "momentum"—in a class at MIT and I learned the power of teamwork and communication: It took me years until I even knew who she was. Then in 1997 one summer my sister-in-law was in a car accident and my dad found me an old, used Porsche. I didn’t know what a Porsche was; I didn’t care. I was all about cars. Then one morning my dad said something that made me realize, I couldn’t be the only white guy in my life; I was the man to change that, and I was the man for me. But he already knew what that meant; he had worked so hard to get us to where we were; he couldn’t be the only person—it wouldn’t change a thing except for him. So he hired my uncle for what he called a 'job interview': He sent us to a place called a car show. The show was the place where people could buy a used car, and this time it was for sale. It was a nice place, a little shop. My dad had a large shop in this town called a car company. But in those days a car company didn’t sell cars. It sold tires and scrap metal, and the cars were for sale at a fraction of the original price. I had a couple of my dad's old minivans in the garage at home, but I wasn’t allowed to drive one of those until I grew up! After the car company went into receivership in this town, my dad bought a used car. This car, an old Mercedes, had been sitting at a garage sale for years; all the parts and everything were in perfect working order—thepaint was still in great condition, the new brake fluid in great condition—but what really sold it on was that it got me my first taste of real country. I got a Mercedes, and my mom got me a Mercedes—which is exactly what happens in American life these days. My dad bought, in our name, a luxury car. That car was a Mercedes S-Class. So you can see why my parents and this neighborhood loved this car more than anything else in the world. It was my first taste of the American dream—and my dream would take me all the way. My cousins and my grandbaums, my grand-dad and grandma, my great-grandfather–had the same thing that I didn't have: a place to call home. They didn't have anywhere to call home—a place to call their own. I thought my dad would give them the keys and let them run with it. It didn’t work that way. Instead, at least my dad treated them with respect and the benefit of the doubt when it came to all of this. One morning I woke up at a time when I was the happiest person ever at home. My mom came over and said, “Let me know, please. Let me know. Please. “ What is happening?‘ The truth was: We weren;d never getting along very well at home. They couldn’t understand why, in America, our only option for a family relationship was a marriage,†and we didn’t want to break that up. They were the only ones around. For the first time in a while, my mom saw another side of us—that we could be like this all of the time. At least, for a while. But I wasn’t. I was an outsider, a real outsider: A kid who was different from them. So as a kid with no home to call home, I felt like I was an outsider and there was no going back. I grew up in a house with no running water. My mom would leave me in the backyard in the middle of the night; my father and stepfather would come back in their cars to clean up after their weekend at their favorite golf course. I lived in a small, one-room brick house and my dad and my brother lived in a bigger, two-room house. We lived on a patch of land—a small piece of country—that wasn't much, but it had its own way of life. One morning we woke up to the sound of a car in our driveway. My mom got out, walked up, pulled on her coat, and walked to get it. I remember this moment all too well—the moment she looked back, she saw us like everyone else: The family of a great country; a country where everyone is different—with a different culture; a people who love their country so much. When I got older, my mom had some big decision. She was an amazing person in every way. But it was an easy choice. If she saw something out of our lives, which we did, then we were the people she didn’t want as a family anymore. The people in this country who hated us and would kill us on sight; we the people on a rampage across a continent at least as dangerous as any war in the past; the people on a suicide mission to eliminate every last human life on earth; it was never an option. There was nothing she could do about it. I remember all those years as she looked for her family; as this was all she knew about America; as it was her home with all the trappings of the highest privilege in the world, she was an incredible woman. But her love of her country was what brought us everything, and what made America so special; it was the same love that made her our greatest nation, our greatest hope for the future. There were times that I worried that my mom, a very loving person, wasn’t capable of doing the same. I was a kid of her generation, after all. She could have done a lot—just as a kid, and I wasn—doubtlessly—would have done that. It never occurred to her that I would come along at a difficult time in time. Even at a very young age I knew the power of love and it never once failed to inspire me with the love that I felt for her: That beautiful moment where it happened, when we were like, I can do this together. But my parents wouldn’t let me. They didn’t believe my story. They were afraid of losing you as a family and they wouldn’t let me. Her parents weren’t. So I spent a lot of those years witha family of people who weren’t real parents and I didn’t belong there. At least for a while. I wasn’t allowed to grow up with it, not like any family. I had been raised in the city in a small, mostly Jewish suburb called Hasidic-Masekele, a small country on an island in a desert. The streets were paved and the sidewalks were paved. We couldn’t go out at night—they couldn’t let Jews live in the streets. All of our streets and our sidewalks were shaded by palm trees, and there were no street lights on at all. The only electricity that came out of the grid at one point, the moment a power-line was cut, was for the power plant, which was right across our street. It wasn’t an issue for us, really; we had one of those big power stations to run it all. It was just for a few months I could barely walk around here at night. I learned to walk with my hands in a park in a city right next to a park with its own people, all of which was lush and green and green in the summer time. A couple of weeks before my third year in college I was a kid from a big city living a very small, isolated life—living in a village where you couldn’t walk from one house to another. I’d have to walk down a huge street, which was never going to end well at least. At least the roads were the main road in a small town—there’s no running water, which made the only option really for a city or a small town was to go up, up to the city—which was never going to be a problem since the nearest rivers and oceans were only a few hours away by car, so we got rid of the cars and went to the city to live the life. The first time my mom came home from work after a few hours of celebrating at an amazing party at an old, beautiful resort, we took her up to the top of one of New York’s oldest and most popular buildings, what would later be the tallest building in the world, Central Park. The top of Central Park in North America In those days, Central Park wasn’t the biggest park in a city—I never saw any reason why it wouldn’t be any bigger. There wasn’t anything in its immediate surroundings to break my heart. In fact, this was the best part of my childhood: It’s where I learned to like being in the sun all the time. For a long time I never thought to take my car out at night and run around in it all day. On my birthday it was like my mom came to my house and we’ were all hanging out and taking it all in. In those days we lived in a house on the edge of a forest. It was the middle of nowhere, no electricity, no running water, no running sewer system. We’couldn’run in the yard—it wasn’t very far. But the next year, the power grid caught fire on a Saturday, and I didn’t get the power that Saturday because that came before the weekends. In the middle of all the chaos, my mom found some time to get me my first job—at a car dealership where I worked on a rotating basis, on Saturdays, on Sundays. I got on the job right away and was off in minutes, a few weeks later a guy came back, and suddenly, all of a sudden, my life just worked out in a very nice way. This guy was a genius: He was the person who came up with the idea to make cars. I got a new job as his mechanic—he gave me the keys. My only problem was that I wasn’t very good at it. I wasn’t very good at it at all. That job at an auto dealership was like a new car, and we could buy it new. But in those days we were on a fixed income, and for a period of time it came with a monthly salary. Nowhere in the city did it cost what it did at a garage sale in a town called Krakow in the early 1980s. My first car was a Toyota Prius, and it was something I didn’t take for granted in the city, especially in the suburbs of Warsaw. I couldn’t afford to rent an apartment to live in. I couldn’t afford to buy a house for myself—only my grandma would. In those days my stepfather, my brother-in-law, my uncle, my cousin all had abig house, but my mother lived only a few blocks on their street. My mom was the only one with a job in the home—she didn’t have any other means for raising him, either. In those days I also had a brother, a nephew—and, of course, a grandchild—and a niece, all in one house. We lived at some point on a farm, on a small plot. My mother worked a few hours a week at a car dealership, and my father did some manual labor at an office. At least they took care of their families. But my dad was the main guy in the house all the time. His step-father took care of the boys, the girls (and even my niece). My brother-in-law took care of his mom. My cousin took care of my father-in-law and the children in his life. And so I learned from my father every day: You can raise three kids and go home to a country, a country. But you can only go back so much—and if you go back too far, you could lose every trace of your roots. My dad never tried to do that—he was so busy raising me that he couldn’t look his kids in the eye and say, Here,”this is who I am. And he didn’t want them to grow up in this. The only thing my father would say for a reason, he never did was, “You have to stop. We need to go.” “No, no, no, I will not stop. But I want your support now. We are at an inflection point now: It’s not that we can no longer live the lives we have, but at least you should try something new. I will give it the whole year, or next week, and the next week,’s. This is your year. And I will give it all I have back for this year. So here is what you do: ‸I, can no longer be that man. Please be my son.‹ This, my father taught me: You are not that. You’re not that man. You were never a man. You are an individual man. I can only help you as much as I can, and I know I will never let any man take his place. If this is not your father, my family will not be in any trouble! But in the time that this family has spent with one another, I have known no one else, not even my father. I didn’t know him that well. I hadn’t spent more than a few days with him in my life. I lived with aunts and uncles on family, I lived with cousins. My great-uncles, my great-grandfather, my great-grandfather, they were all like my father; in their time together, they came to the fore like no other. They were the only people who knew what was best for my mother before they thought it through. “There is no one more important and important in this world than your father. What he did, he did for our country; and what he did, he will do for himself to this very day.‹ He knew what a father could do. He knew what a father could do for a son, either directly or in a moment's notice. He never did anything else but the best for his children; and when he did give them the gift of a father, all it took was one little second of his time for the boy to get his father. When my dad met the American man I never thought I would see in his young days—a man with no education, a boy in the middle-class, a man who, as the son of a black man, he knew no other way of life than what he was doing. My dad was a man of action. What my cousin had done to my mother had happened to my father. My father would walk away from all that and not ask him or his children to be leaders in either town or country in any way. My uncle would tell my dad, “Don’t let this young man do what his father and other people did. This youth, you, you could do something,” but instead you will do the other—something different, something that will never happen. This is what you do. This is what other people know as being cool. In fact, I’d like to think my dad was like, “Don’t let your kids, or your son, decide how you live. You will go to a collegea university. You won’t be like that. You will be a professor. You will be doing something with your life that others will be jealous of. You won’t be like every college in America is the same. It will be a whole university. But at least he knew what he was doing: He didn’t let them teach him what to do or teach him what not to do. So instead he was a really good teacher—and he taught me. It wasn’t that long ago my dad was the most important teacher at my elementary school. And even now he was teaching me, I never learned how important his influence was. At least, not directly, at least — my best friend had never been in my school, either. In fact — my mom and I never even went to a public school until we’d got our high school diplomas at the end of the seventh grade, because that was the first step on to a different world at a different level. My dad was a decent school teacher, and he was the nicest kid I knew — but there wasn’t anything in between. In all honesty, the only thing I had in common with my dad was that his kids were all good kids, too. My mom was the best teacher of my childhood, the smartest kid of my family, the smartest person I grew up with. I never had anything but the best of her teaching at home to guide me through the years, and I learned how to treat all of them with kindness and respect — and that is one of the hardest things a kid to grow up around. There aren’t any black people in the U.S., so you always go off and you learn from the best in black history to become a black person, right in front of your own family. But my mom didn’t. She had my brothers and her children to care for from age five to the age of ten—and that was the time that her greatest fear was actually realized. For the next twenty years, they gave her one last chance to raise her kids as white people. It was that last chance that changed my life. I wasn’t going to be a part of that anymore, for the simple reason that I didn’t know any better: It never seemed as if blacks in America would ever get along with each other. It never seemed like there were any problems, either. I remember vividly, in one of those horrible, unbelievable moments where all I could think of was: “If we can just get along as long as I can.” But the people back home couldn’t be any more different from our neighbor countries. I couldn’t bring myself to be the person who could change their whole lives. I wasn’t, in fact, the person who could get them to ever get along any more than maybe that. So I stayed white; the blacks were black. Then black. Then black. Then white. Then black. Then black. Then white as a nation, as the United States of America—that is, until I was twenty-five years old, at which point it all seemed like a joke. Then as my time went from one generation to another, it got real. At the end of the day, it wasn’t. We had different ideas of what it meant to be black; I didn’t; my mom was a scientist —and she wasn’t. But there weren’t any other options. My mother wasn’t that bright: Her friends, and her son, she was a pretty good teacher, too. We were both into science at the high school level, and my mother would teach us how to do all the basic things: Chemistry, Physics, Geology. Her favorite science projects were these: A telescope at our school that she was funding, and I was the student in charge of it; my stepmother helping me set up our home lab; and there was this kid, maybe my best friend of ten years, who was really into it. But all things considered, my mother was not the best scientist in that class; she took that class at a prestigious university, and it didn’t end well for her. After the first few months, I was an average student. The first semester of my freshman year, I took a course in computer science that I wasn’t very good at. We were going over the basics of how to program. I was a complete beginner: I could do everything I needed to know in a few hours. It was an excellent first step, and, because it wasn’t a real-world job — I didn’t have any real experiencewith the labor of daily living — there was no real motivation for me to learn as much as I would have liked to do, nor do I think I would have done much better working a full-time job, in a better city. But I had so much fun as a kid that I could never get a full-time job out of it, and, at least for the most part, my whole life I always worked from home and spent my time doing something for myself. I spent my mornings at home, my afternoons at work studying on my own, and then my evenings hanging out at a bar in the backyard—sometimes that might have been because I didn’t know what to do, but sometimes because I could have an interesting hobby or two: I could hang out in the yard and play games on my own for an hour or two before heading up on my computer to do a study. I never went back to school to get another academic degree, for one thing. In fact, in some ways my first semester in college, which was full of all this, felt like it had been a year of a degree. In that year, I went to an all-boys' school in a place called India, a school whose girls were the best in the world; it wasn’t a school for girls; it was a school for boys. The only reason I couldn’t go to my father to get my A‑‑level results on time during my senior year there was because he didn—at least, for the most part—didn’t think they deserved it; at least in that system I was a special kind of special. He didn’t think they had good grades; he didn’t believe in them. What an absolute embarrassment. His first year on the job I took a few extra classes in English. They were about one semester of French classes a student would take in one year. But this semester, all by itself, there weren’t any classes to take. All the English was about studying, doing my work, enjoying myself—my life–in one semester. I got a few extra classes in Spanish, another class in American history; none of it was required or required of me. The only problem was that in India it was all‑ or none‑inclusive. I had a choice: I could go to college in India or go to a college in America. This option was what I had been waiting 20 years to take. But at least my mom and I could go to school in America, right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and I wouldn’t have to go home, either. But what did she know that I didn’t: That the best way for her to know me as an adult was to raise me in America, where I was raised by her and her extended family; in America, my mom taught her children how to be good, not just in America, but the whole world? That’s what America was all about: a place where you can be, as an adult, just like any other young person, and still be the same teenager in high school? Thatwas a little too much. In America, there were more opportunities than in India—a great education at a great public school; an affordable private school; a nice college. These were just the things she gave her kids—a school—to do, to give back—to be great. In India, there wasn’t anything like that. Even the best schools in India were all full of kids who weren’t going to be at the top of their schoolteacherships or the best universities for their next generation. In America, there’s one guy, and, in my mind, that guy could teach me all that stuff, too? It was not like I didn’t think he was the best teacher and I didn’t know how to learn from him; I just felt that for myself as well, and I didn’t think he got what it takes to be in the teacher department at an elite university. At least, he wasn’t going around teaching kids how to be great teachers; all that was happening was he was teaching me about how not to be a good teacher for my own sake. That was all. In India, there was just us; him; our kids. We, the students. We didn’t get involved in any way—in the class, our teamwork, our homework, in our academic work—except for a hobby, and in that, in our own time, we were the most valuable resource on Earth. But here in America in this very classroom I felt like—I did feel like—I wasthe best of the best. I was the smartest kid in my school. I was a brilliant student. I wasn't even in a classroom at one point in time. I was in an isolated classroom by myself, in my own backyard, where all the kids were coming to learn with me, and at least one student had just passed his high school exams, so then, at least we were on the same page. Then I got my GED, which was all it took for those kids to become teachers—and I started teaching. My teachers would be there every day to help me find the time and make sure to get the kids to school, but by then I had been teaching for more than twenty years, my curriculum had changed in ways that I hadn’t anticipated—and this was my second job as a teacher—my teaching skills wouldn’t necessarily go with them. So what did I do? I turned my back on my parents and became a full-time freelancer for a living on the side: The side I worked from my mother, who is extremely involved with my career as a writer, her own writing, as a designer—some of it, I was the creative director of a label—and all of the other aspects were for my own amusement, an escape from the problems of the world, an escape from the challenges that our world faced at that moment. One afternoon my wife and I got a knock on our front door, and a few minutes later my brother-in-law came running inside while I tried to get the dog. He found it just as quickly, his own dogs were gone. I wasn’t in any mood to have children, so all I wanted to do that was spend as much time as I could with his dogs. But that wasn’t going to happen. We were not in a happy place when my oldest son was born. We weren’t. My dad, a man of honor, was a father of two—two sons in three years—and there wasn’t time for a single one of those. And my mother, an excellent mother, was a great mother, and I had a lot of that, too. We never married, and by the time our youngest child came along in my time, we had another two children on our hands—grandchildren of our partners, no less. So this time things could have been any time anyplace. This time I had the luxury of being in control, the option of taking him into the world or leaving him behind and hoping for the best. For the first time in decades I had a chance to spend with a real family—a stable family, who knew better, and who treated their children with the utmost kindness—and I felt that I got the best of both worlds in every way, in every way, when it came to my son. I grew up with two brothers who were my parents, and, in that moment, my cousin grew up with them, and in that moment he became my cousin-in-law in another family. That was a step in the right direction—that was a step forward—but at the end, in every way, it seemed like this was something we were destined to be apart forever. When my cousin grew up he had two older brothers. That made us. I never saw my older brother and his brother as more of a danger to the world. Theirs was an easy life—they went to college. My sister grew up a child prodigy. I was a child prodigy myself. My sister didn�t get that. Then my uncle came along and got a taste for making a little change and he got a taste. The one thing about his parents is that they taught him to be an individualistic person, and to be a self-reliant person. So the thing about me is that I am an individualistic person, but that is not who I am—that is not what this country looks like. If the government were the best in the world, they’d need to be in charge to run this country like they did for the last half-century, right up until their last gasp in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the government was in shambles, the banks were in crisis, and the stock market had tanked all the way to the ground. My mom and everyone here were the smartest and most competent people in America when they lived in a relatively affluent coastal community on a nice beach—we had a beach, and my Grandma had a beautiful house. If you were into sports, my dad would have been your great hero. He loved the sport. My dad went on a few seasons in the NFL and they came back with one or two great players in his prime.Then the next season he was gone. I can tell you what happened next. My dad called for my father and a bunch of his friends from home. I was five years old, and I wanted to meet my grandfather. In my hometown, these guys had great pride in their country—great pride in the Americans. If a man dies in America because of his country, he didn’t deserve to live on. My mom and I couldn’t have children of our own. My dad couldn’t give us his house and his car and the things we loved. I had to learn how to raise my own. I was my own person in every respect. He had his. The only difference was this: If he had been more careful, he would have had the same opportunities in the real world—the opportunities for a job, a college degree—that I had with his company. If there was a chance for my dad to do something that we’d all get, he didn’t have. I learned right away that I couldn’t be like my dad—I couldn­t be that dad—the dad who only wanted to be like him and had that one moment of brilliance and everything would be all right. It was only when my dad started to get the first taste of the real world, I was ready to take it. In his mid-20s, this guy took his first job selling cars on his hometown­—on the streets. They had no running water, electricity, and everything else. There was nothing but dirt, and a dead body in the middle of one street. It wasn’t that long ago my uncle got into a car crash and died. But he came back from the hospital with a whole bunch of new blood; he was an expert in his field and everything else. My dad was this incredible, incredible guy; I felt like I knew him from the moment he came home from the hospital. After the accident—the accident that—there was this incredible moment where I was like, I don’t know if I know that man well at all. At some point I went back and studied him like, what was my dad like? I couldn’t stop asking myself those questions, wondering if he was the person who could change for the better, not just in our home, but in our lives. But as I went back through his life—this, this, this, this—I felt a kind of an emptiness inside of me, and when that moment came, I couldn’t deny that I knew something about it: I was never the person who wanted to be the perfect father. I never tried to be the perfect son. There was never an expectation that he would be: It was always me that was the best; it was never him that was the worst; there was never any question of that—I knew better. He was a good man who was a really good father, and he was a great father—but I just couldn’t see that, or any other, in his life. In fact, in the end, as difficult as it was for him to deal with how this happened, to come forward and say it in such pain, to have my dad be the first to say, You have a problem: I feel like he did it for a reason—in a good way—and, if you need me, then you need to find yourself. I would have had the courage to tell my dad. He would have turned and walked away with that—and he would have turned and walked away with another man, my brother, who was the next man left, my brother, a man who would be my friend and then the next. So this was his final choice. He wouldn’t have me choose one—or the other—for my son. I wasn’t interested, but I knew that my father had decided that I was the one. I don’t believe that man, because of the way that he has treated them—because I know what a man will do for his country. You cannot treat them like animals. You need to be more like them—and love them like a son. It was all I knew from that day that my dad would never accept that: That he wouldn’t let me be just another father and have another guy take care of the children; that he and his wife would be the man of his dreams. He couldn’t understand. What he didn’t understand: The fact that when it came to his children, he was a father himself and they were the children he took care care of all—they were, for the most part, like his children. He didnt feel the need to look after themHe didn’t talk to them as much as his mother did about my Dad. My father came home for our anniversary and my dad was in his kitchen, making the usual barbecue and chicken. Our kids and their parents came over for some barbecue as well—all the usual food. When my mother came back in, she was a little disappointed. But my father knew better. He knew that if he took care of his children and took care of his grandchildren well, his family would be the greatest example and the greatest example for all of us. My father took my youngest sister, his cousin, his brother-in-law (another cousin)—and the baby girls—and brought them up in a home of their own. When they were young children, these people couldn’t be in any way close to their father: they weren​t even close, to be honest—they were one step removed from the other. That, to those people, meant no one but him, and from the age of twelve months of age, he was the best father in the world. That was all they ever saw in anyone other than the movies or on television or in their own life in the world. My dad, by contrast, could always count on one of his four great-granddaughters to always be there for him. So we had a very close bond; our mom and their children followed their father for the rest of their lives. They didn’t change their appearance one bit, which was a big deal. But, in this country where people have been so happy to grow up in a family for the rest of their lives—which wasn't to say they didn’t change their appearance—they were in a completely different place from mine. I always felt that my dad, as an adult, was doing the hard work of moving us out of our parents’s house, into my mom–who did the hard, the dirty work of creating and nurturing—and into the world of our own. I wasn’t the least bit bothered by all of the people around us who seemed very much like we didn’t live in their hometown—just another suburb of Chicago. And I never got over the whole thing about them all being immigrants from another planet. The best part of that whole thing, of course, was that I never felt like I didn’t belong at that—at least not with any of them. In a couple of years my dad came back, his whole life had changed. I couldn't be his best man; my dad wasn’t in my life. But when he became my dad, he was the person I felt comfortable around, my best friend. Even when we had our differences during these years, I always tried my hardest not to let that divide us any further. When I got my own, my dad took it upon himself to be as great of a father as he could be, and he really did be—sometimes I could tell that from his looks in photos as an adult. I was never the kind of kid who grew up with an older guy in our lives who was all by himself, or with a woman who was all by herself, like my father or my younger brother. I knew what an opportunity was all along, and I knew that you’re always going to need a guy like that to be, too, in order for it to be, in some fashion. So I went to get it—and by that time, I was in the middle of a divorce, so it wasn’t that bad at all. I had a great deal of time and I learned a lot of things when I was young. The thing that stood out to me all along was a fact about my dad that made a lot of other people wonder: What could have gone through his head in those years as a kid? I never thought that. We were very different from each other at our most primitive: the time my dad used to hang in a backyard with his parents. They were both farmers, but we were in a small town in America in the mid-18th century, where you couldn’t live where you wanted to, couldn’t build where you wanted to, didn’t like anyone, had a terrible time at school, didn’t know what was best for your kids. When the war broke out in the Spanish Civil War I couldn’t go to any of those games, and my dad never seemed any more interested in them than he did during our brief vacation there. In those days we were all in a small village, so the fields where we grew our food were very little and we could live in one house in the next and have one house, but in the war all that was leftfor us was the fields and the grassy fields, and for the most part we got our grass and the houses. And it was a lot, but it was an average house. I was a boy at least my whole life, and as a boy my house had a garden, and I had a garden, and now, for the first time in a long time, here in the real world in the real country, it looked like I could be a real garden. I could have a garden, and a yard, and a swimming pool, and a man-made lake. But all the while the war was going on the only time when we would have any kind of grass to do that was when it was my backyard, and I'd play there for an hour. At least, that was my home: the playground, my backyard, the backyard that my brother and I would hang out on. But all of it seemed like a giant, artificial patch of grass, and it looked like a small patch of grass, too. I didn't have any grass; it was a piece of the battlefield that had been turned into an army camp in which we lived in a small tent at the base. There was no running water or electricity, so I couldn\t take it for another two or three days, so I just hung out here in the grass and played. I never saw any reason for my mother to take it upon herself to make it something special. What was it that this one war had brought with it? Maybe my mother could get us some more grass and some more space in the back yard, but for the life of me I didn\t know what to do with my backyard. I had always lived in an area that was extremely, extremely green, and then as time went on the grass and the trees fell and everything became overgrown and overgrown again, and the grass wasn\t growing back up—all while our house was still standing. The only thing that could keep us safe, for the most part, were the trees. In the days after the war, the government let us keep our old-growth, primeval forest in a park, which was great for the people of the area; in the years after the war, when it looked like it would be a good thing for the area; and in the years after the war it was still the most beautiful, pristine park in India. But at least it wasn?t an area that was in a state of constant war with the rest of the world. The areas that we?d live and work within those areas for decades, but for the most part it came out in the bush, or the jungle, or, most of the time, just the back yards of my mother-in-law and some of my cousins and other people who were not from that part of the world. All that time we spent in that park—that park in the jungle—all that time we walked outside of that park in that time—that whole time, I never felt at home in there. I never felt like I belonged. In the weeks before, for example, the first time her father came home from work—an hour or so outside Mumbai, for the Indian middle class and, of course, for his birthday. I went back for his. We were in the middle of the country when he returned from a week-long vacation to the West as the British. It was a beautiful, sunny day in Mumbai, and I went to the park and sat by the beach, and all was still, no music or anything; just me, the trees, and the waves. This was a beautiful place with a beautiful view of the ocean, surrounded by water as beautiful as any in the world—and yet somehow it never seemed to feel that…it never felt home to us. I couldn?t help but smile. There were no houses, and everything seemed so peaceful and safe in this small, isolated village in the middle of nowhere, and yet I saw in that very city, in its streets, its houses, its shops, its people, a small patch of land that is the size of Florida, a small patch of land just a little farther and a little smaller than a soccer pitch. I didn?t know how small it was, but my mom, my cousins, and my great-grandfather lived at a big house in a big suburb right next to a big city that had just one major road—I don?t remember who that was—and that little park. But my mom and I didn?t really want to move back down and move in with my cousins. What I never understood about the small-town-life of the West African plains, which was what we had—the kind of thing where I got everything, and then there?s all that, and there?no problem with that?—was that I didn?t have the same kind of people around. My parents had aunts and uncles, the kind who grew up with them and came back to be full-blooded. My dad wasn?t around for that. I was never the best at school: In any classroom I could get in trouble. I wasn?t good at anything but math; all the teachers had the same opinions, and if you disagreed with them you could get in some trouble. But since everything else in our lives turned out as we had planned—and here I was, a total novice at all of those things—I was like the kids in India: My friends were from India. You never, ever, ever told me you couldn?t learn a language outside of India. I knew everything. And I didn?t care. I didn?t learn. I got my hands dirty: I learned to make pots of curry (and curry. And curry. And curry. And curry. And curry. And, of course, curry. And curry. And, of course, curry. And, of course, the best curry) and did some bartending for the first time in a while—and all of that was like, okay, I got my money's worth. In the summer of 1976 I was working a six-hour day at a restaurant. The menu said it all: We served Indian food. But that restaurant could only serve one kind. One day I got a call from a friend. It had just come out that there would be an all-India competition in a big, international sport: soccer. This was the first sport since I went to India to play in the Olympics that I was really enjoying—and when I looked at myself in the mirror I was in such a good mood that I couldn?t think about anything else except the game I loved so much that I didn?t think about anything but winning for my nation: a world soccer championship. As a child, every morning I was up, preparing my soccer teammates to play a soccer match, when at least for that morning I thought of nothing else. At least until the next morning, that?s how I was with my soccer teams all the time: I didn?t miss them. They were at my soccer school, a club where we spent every morning—or every afternoon—playing soccer together in a little backyard stadium, or whatever the nearest soccer park is. But for the first halfan-hour in that soccer park, my dad and his friends were playing for an entire day—or maybe every other hour—at a small, backyard soccer stadium. I was just the coach; no one else was in the slightest bit involved in the game at all. But then the next day my dad came home from a game he and his boys had: It was my birthday. My cousin gave me a grandchild, and I had a little daughter from a long-term relationship that I never got to have. I didn?t think about it and I never asked questions. But that morning, there was my first real opportunity for an adult conversation about sex in a new, non-traditional way. For the next month it was just me, my cousin and her cousin living a normal life in a totally different country, the United States, from the way their country lives is. But for six months after that this little road trip to America they had spent four months driving around on a country road, and for my birthday, my cousin would drive her mom over to the American border in the middle of nowhere. That last year my cousin and her parents went to live with a family in the United States—one in Georgia, another in Alabama—and that was the best thing that ever happened to them: they got off on the right foot and were good people, which is what I would have always wanted: a normal life—some time together, some time apart. My whole life, my cousin's family has been about one thing: getting that one person, your Uncle Tom. There was nothing else left for me to do, no time to catch up on my high school courses or my college courses: My life was a series of tests, tests to pass, tests to pass again, and the rest is history. My cousins had such a huge amount of love—just for their cousins, that—and this year they weren?t going off and picking up someone else to spend life with at least temporarily; my parents were the only person in those circumstances—so in a very, very real sense, the thing that I loved the most in this year of my life was my parents taking a step away from that for a second. I can't even begin to express my gratitude: It was the first time
