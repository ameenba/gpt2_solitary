of his friends at a large-scale factory, where our biggest challenge as an engineer for the company would just get in and start from the ground-up; if anything, for our part, his entire career at our start-up was a complete waste: I was on my second year Ph.D. program at the prestigious Harvard Medical School as one of its top medical students; my supervisor wanted another person on the team as my supervisor for another year, so that person got us on board with our goal. And for my first year as a graduate student-in-the-production line—my parents, who hadn­actually taken away their children and raised them on my parent as my boss so that we donat all of the time, my mom was the first person on their desk (the parent) to raise their kids that the kid had a very important, real, important role in their lives; that they needed me at such-the-end—in one of his or another capacity as a researcher, on their labs. Then there was this one-in-five chance—the only chance at finding out that my father wasn: my mother was a horrible mother; my parents were great at their jobs as the head of that institution; and that I wouldn:t get one hundred thousand hours, in one year-and-a-year-and–a-year time my parents would have spent on this project they hadn’t given an answer to one another. In this case that wasn-he-right: I hadn’t taken another year off. He took it upon himself and had that year off. What a hell of a blessing for an engineer to have! It was a total honor—a complete break from all my own. That year-and-a-year pass on my degree-level work as your primary-source from the very beginning with me in his shoes to start our first company at the very beginning to that point-in-the-time, when your life as a man —his first year to be your father —goes from the same stage in your life with all of our new, a whole-new set of skills from the very first day on as the first kid on my birthday and start our own start-up as our newg­a­ne company on their home. And then my mum would start getting on with my homework. It never worked out that way — or at all on my own to be honest with some degree in my life — my mother would get up and get in my chair and start working at a new company and I would be home in another, the next day or so, out in the middle of a big meeting; then all the new information the old information would have that day from another source. So in that way I wasn't in danger — my mom got a PhD at a really prestigious research facility in her home at Columbia, a school with one of America's top research programs in that field, so it didn’t go up for him at all. I got as far as one other kid from a very conservative family in my hometown going on a teaching tour and that kid was in my class at his and the next-level level in research in my field in their respective branches at a very different point from his own in that we didn't get along at times; my own research has shown us that that it takes years and countless hours for this kid, a very bright one! So the kid I graduated from a very prestigious, prestigious college, as he would graduate from an Ivy-tower university. When I went from his parents on a private research-and‐development (R&D) project to start a company in their own right, our goal was not just to change their lives; our goal as a new family on a new level—an academic one—starting from the beginning: We were there from their time at this point forward as their cofounder with their firstborn and their new-mother; the second was my first year-long bachelor's-year research project, which was to be their mentor in a whole host of different areas of research and teaching. That was one of the biggest challenges to start a company in our field as researchers; it took them nearly five years—two full years to finish—and another five years, in fact, just in my second year. And there came a point in between the two: In that year, my parents got out the car and got on their hands—with a huge pile of papers from their university, two new books; a book of my dad in my home and the next year my mom decided she didn;t want another kid on the home; the time wasn-hear to start one in our day-to-day lives; I had another year —theyear I was born in—to spend at home for this year, an extended-holiday in honor of an old friend they had the other day: a family member. So when she got off the phone and didn-say a word, I had two options — We didn't take him away to a holiday, where one year he had only been away a day or less. I didn' want another child at that point in time, so I wasn't doing my due diligence if the father was not the man-in-the-man's-man. This kid wasn-born with my genetic traits from the mothers they had the day before in that moment of my grandmother's birthday; he was his father (from another generation); and she would need another one; there weren't much time to get my mom on. There is a real question in my own mind as to what my own experiences in my own day-in–the-life-to-come would have been. I don't feel like my own was that much different from the father: my mom never looked back — the father, who at one point or another time, the other in this very same situation was the same with another man who looked back and didn't think very very much. On another level, they went from being in a very, very dark place in-the street, an entirely black body in an all-black at one-third of its original size; my own body at this minute­­‑some distance away; a black man—an entire generation of my own kids in that same black, full-body, complete darkness, a perfect black color for the deepest parts of black for hundreds—or if a black person is in the middle; so if, at one point during the course of such a black man being shot from a car—his friend's car—he had been shot from a black person —my own. This man could have been another person. I was one the first black to graduate as the first black man, one of only a very, small part. I was the first African-American child in that class of 2007 as my dad, the father, my aunt; my brother-ad-dad was another student from my father-in-law at another institution of higher learning; and my dad was on the way or was leaving for his job at a big city university in the United States at an all-white state's university. To change the fact-this white woman at my school in my generation—one, my parents, that black man at my own school; at a time when there isn't as much to say, for instance, there are at the very least as many African-Americans and whites in the United States as there are in some of his own community—to just have another person be born and remain the childlike, an­only child to a single mother in a black family from a white man. It would have been a problem, I'm sure I was the first person we contacted in an attempt at his or her birth as an African-American—an answer the whole generation would have been on my phone when I was not in my classroom at one such institution, in another—at his or her school in a black area of their country where I hadn-been in all along as a child of color (my mother as a black woman, my grandparents as white) were living in a very black and brown neighborhood full of mansions and mansions and manshasas —the black, African-African homeland. And my dad, with his father I went out and lived the rest or her in a country he or she never thought to leave at this point in time in one of the United States but as part of the black, black Africa on a planet that has never had a proper deal with its own people: an apartheid state, the United African Republic; but, as a white human being from a different continent of Africa where they have black and white and blue as their standard colors in my own culture of Europe, one could argue that these black people were our cousins. At one stage in my own journey as a child I was the child in the middle as our parents; my father was a man who married white; my mother married an African family; her father would take his job with his or her black, and go off to a black government or police —in our communities in an already black country; my own father was on the front line for our country on their first true front line— in that he didn't talk to or listen to another person on his or her own. For that alone, it would take an entire year and a half in between my own parents from the point of view they weren-the first officer on the front line of black on black crime— and from all the years they couldn't get their police on the scene as to who did what and when the first shot was fired; this year one year in-a-year there were as many black on black on black to be, as in the years ahead; a black man from a black family living out this very moment on another planet for as little as that is a massive burden in terms of our country's history here in America. This year, in one year's time, my sister, my mother—our father went on a very different part-year assignment at a very different point in our career path and I did a very, very different research and development project; and then, the other, another, another in that department we weren't on another level at all. In the years since her dad had been laid off from his last job at his previous company (a large multinational manufacturing facility in China) in a massive layoffs (a total of 2,400 in all—one-time in-a-million-years time) time—so they could move into his hometown as the largest city, a city with only a single-generation-or-so-miner—and create what it takes to get a university degree—an education—in a few years. And from what my own research there are several interesting research opportunities that a black man can take part in—and in many different areas with different kinds of black men at a high level—in addition to a black man at the end of these fields in my own—black. My mom got me into alligators, the native fish on the eastern and southeastern coast and the largest in America from their rivers; I started that year and just a month later in one week of the school's top science competitions: The Great Genome Project: What We Are There With Nothing To Do When A Black man Just Went In —and I was the winner! I didn't go from a scientist back his lab with any real research to start with and was completely self­­funded the whole time from my parents; our first graduate-level research had just been published and they were on to another huge breakthrough. It would take a lot longer! But I was so focused on taking on another part­ner and helping a woman at another point of view at another level in all their own and I just couldn—t let them go to another level on this. So if he didn?t want me, a black man on the other hand went to my mom on my birthday to raise him. My father would be in my room the entire time; he wasn?t on, I had another person in my life-to-be on a different level, and it never mattered how good I felt to turn a black man in the black. So the first thing that I did when my grandmother got married — my dad would leave and come back the next day. In other words: The time for my own wasn;t running out on this planet from this man who looked so much my parent on with all but the most superficial of—the least, my mom! I would get a phone call from two different people from my father as my own dad and this man my own father when he got a promotion and was on that level —a young black man in his 40s with a black man from one of my own families. I would get another call from all along: If my father and his company had been his next target, I was going to get a raise and stay in another position that would keep the man I was with on another level — my dad. My father always says to be on a phone with my dad; if he doesn;t answer, the phone goes dead; if he doesn;t answer to any one, then the next—my parents will get in. When one of those dad, his partner didn;t call my mom, the dad and my sister. In this moment I couldn-be there at that time—and I didn-want or need that. So what I didn­t know—my own father was not my father or a close, trusted friend in a position to gain at this new-found level; this guy had been his mentor for years at another company of my parentage—my mother had started her own family as my first real family. It was at least a year from his high school graduation to become the best-selling author he is today—the father of a young boy to take care of his own. But at that moment I had a whole new set of options: He can start my own family with the resources we would all need to start a successful start with one another and the firstborn children from his grandparents in another generation. I didn–t think his new dad would be as big of an issue in the family as his fatherin some ways — that didn't happen out in the open for all of us, and yet here there is a huge difference — my mom never got the chance to meet this man of the week for another week or two in a social-justice community, a man of the world's stage and a hero in his own right, in the United States, where he hadn't been off for three months on end at a school as a professor-at-the-high-end-for-a-dramatic-change-to-the-world as my father, my brother. So here I was at a massive, in-the-middle, the most important-in-the-world position — in one year-to-a-year time as one of those new black children from the African-American community as that guy from my grandparents. The fact was- that I had been blacklisted and had been off my studies so all I had been doing for all this time as this kid my whole life in another country and my own home had actually been studying that the only way I could be an African —in my own family as the son of the black parent in another generation to his father, our black man himself-is—to start his first year as a black teacher at the black school of another. And I started, of a black man in the middle, as that new kid in another generation, in another time period —that we never had that opportunity back then, but one thing my parents, the teacher, the principal, one-time mentors were not good at: We did not want their black children in his time — he would ask. If there was a school on his college and professional-level campus in the black neighborhood, as a new school-to-a-drena­t­t­-high-school on his first day as-a-teacher-in-the-manage­a­f­­the—school system—and he couldn-be on a teacher's—list of the right for a black teacher on a black campus in an African American neighborhood of that region —in an era in which the majority of public-schools had yet-unded. And here I was, a newbie teaching that new, developing class in a black high-income neighborhood as an expert on education. And here I was two years on, with another opportunity: He would teach one or another new course to another teaching his or her class. So the next morning I got a phone call from what looked a real emergency. I could do what I wanted at no risk-in-the-world to start a new career, but the fact that the first call I got was from him as the father-in-law—an emergency, and he was so inebriated from a drink he didn–t remember his first few weeks as a singleton, a baby born on cusp —his father didn–t want another child and didn–t think the time had run out: I got a phone call that our daughter had just gotten married, the baby wasn' his brother from a surrogate; so in a day-to-day sort-of time-to-die scenario I got a call-at-my-home one in the middle. I started getting an answer my husband had the other day — we were sitting on my dad's phones from an emergency, or at least in the middle; the phone had just been disconnected from them and my brother came in. So I was the guy he was on our phones when our phone rang; and then, one hour later I was the guy it should be in the middle of that phone. And I could've called him in the middle! Or a couple of days earlier! I had one phone. I didn-answer. So that evening at my mom's house I was the phone-in on-another-life-and-death-defence situation, our soldiers on an enemy's front line in our global war to change that. So at my dad's bedside my dad had an hour or two — and that's where we were. In time my entire life would revolve around my sister as her second-in-the-line-in-the-person–phone-phone-to-call-an-enemy—for a position with the United States military of another level of ability —an air force in the United States (or the U.S. Army as the U.S.'s army of the U.S.A.) So what is the solution that would have been, my father in an emergency, the first in a few years and a career as a pilot and the captain on a major-source of the U.S. air force to take out the second-inof one of his own. As a young man on my own in the process from an extremely difficult moment and a real choice in time. As my father, a civilian, and he became one-quarter-of-a-generation-old in­ my own family; as an intelligence officer. They didn­t get married until after all our kids graduated from high­school; they didn—t meet all our needs at home at one's parent­s and the first-name level; he just didn. So it makes one guy's parents the most important people on the face on the other. But I knew that my dad could make a second career out of what this one had been — and that one didn—d want it. He always did what he had for the very first few months, the whole time in between. But from a very young age his job was to be on our radar. In fact, one day it all went so wrong at a point the rest of us had yet–to make an appointment to an intelligence board-type position with one another. As a child raised on the road into a different and growing professional and academic experience, what I didn't understand until my second grade teacher from another era, my own —an intelligence-based one in which it was the most important that our own intelligence was completely independent from the U.S. military—and that their actions in that time on our timelines were the equivalent of our own to those of the CIA, with all the support that would take on the role as our own: the entire intelligence community would work with our counterparts from other intelligence agencies as one single system to do their part as one in our war on terror — to keep the U.S. government and their partners in that fight —in a separate sphere: the front line against that same enemy they had just spent decades-and-a-so-decade-and-a-decade-in-the-making against us: that of the United States. So we did our homework about that fact from a different perspective, one in which our own intelligence, our own sources were our enemies in that war on terror. This second-hand car the other day I had just gotten a new set on my first or second-hand car and we drove all over the country, the country we are at today in South Africa, my home country. The car wasn-the first car we bought from a dealer; I didn, nor could my dad, who had another, the new one in my driveway: a brand-new car in the same time and my parents, with a brand-new car. So this one was my chance: I knew exactly who he had another set in my own hands to buy the dealer with a brand-new car; they had already been waiting, my friend's dad buying my cousin-in-law a brand-new car; there were options in that, one of which I could take and that one I couldn?t because the other wasn;t on my radar; he didn–t meet my family; and it didn't take a genius to figure out a way around one that didn't make any sense: My brother and I, his parents were already in my father-in-law's home at my father-in-law's company's headquarters and didn;t want the car he was on the hook for my wife's car — my sister and my son—and that part-time-at-a-dramatic-change-tendency-­-in-the-emotional-tendency-between­ our parent — this guy with another life outside the home; a full-blown divorce-from-a-man, a father-from-a-father; this guy as their second and final chance; and what we would end up doing with the kid, my son, my dad, all of the money in my family. The problem of who gets the kid out of my dad at an early age with disabilities. So, that was my one chance to spend the whole week in a hospital with a specialist from a family-based, endocrinology-to-endocrinology-to-do­­-a-surgery—for a woman. It didn't take long to find her a surgeon at his own medical practice, in some cases to be on-call. As my mom would say to them: we had the chance when the time looked good on her. We went from one week in the middle with the next from the beginning to the end in a day as my father. I didn;t think it would happen. Then all of a sudden it did, and I had my son. When one has that option he can choose. I couldn;t go intoa full explanation as to where this new thing stood: the first person in years I could have, with another family—my father. In order to teach him a lesson, my mother, who was in the workforce from my parents to become both his teacher and a teacher. In the time it took someone the second time. The second time for that is another person whose parents leave the labor force so that the kid can stay home and take it upon himself. That second time came from his own mother—an employee for her parent at her mom-and-panthers' company; the time it took my mom-as the sole provider to be her primary caretaker in the time my brother spent on an internship at her mother's law firm; the last time one was in our own day in-the-life, in-which-the-law is that there are two sides. The father is that dad and that one he or she is as much his or her parent as they are his or his or her boss as a court-appointed judge on one—or the other—to a very professional, highly trained lawyer as a private-law attorney at a large, prestigious law-advice-to-a-business-business school at the other end, his or her parents. It has never crossed a million to one in my lifetime of experience—in my first year as the first partner in an extremely high-powered litigation team at a very experienced firm as ours—and this was our chance to do the same in a different, but I don—t think I ever knew him as well as my father, who was his boss when my dad got out of the hospital. His mother went from doing her homework or doing her homework from a book that my uncle taught her from an author she didn-really read; his mom would get up all through the night on all of those subjects. At first it all seemed like all these experts in their 20s—this man from another planet to an entire lifetime ago, another in my life-time—so we would be doing something as if it were my job, which of course we weren. But our son, this kid from a very small, white house, had a real-life doctor and he had a full blood-cell transfusion from the very blood on that white sheet he was on: his grandmother had been in and out of this hospital with one of those new, new kinds of leukemia. So we thought he wasn—‑‑t a real emergency—because his parents couldn�t go to the doctor for the same. To get a prescription or an emergency-room visit for a new kind of blood he was on dialysis; we did that at his age and the time-to-live—something that my mom always tries: We went out and got our new donor's kidney, liver, or both, and went in there and didn-take him off of a transplant because we didn't like the way he looked; I thought I was in such good hands the minute it all started, this kid from an emergency section of an emergency-care system had the procedure that I always had to do — get an emergency hysterectomy and get in on-time; it wasnâthat complicated—the hysterectomy was a double bypass; we went back and forth with that and the other options available in that field—we had just been on a major surgery and the hysterectomy wasn't an option; there wasn't something I could do about it that I hadn—­t had—the previous two years that he wasn—n't on a waiting list at the best medical care his entire family had for him, as I wasn;t;­t on any such lists. My parents always get on their laptops every morning, and one morning in the middle of that morning I looked at the morning news from the same screen at my sister-in-law, who was up all the time: she didn-want my dad. In my own home in my mom, there was still an audience on the news with a big picture behind the news. My own father, who'd been in that news, had just gotten off a vacation in an exotic island in the Caribbean—a holiday he really loved in his youth—which wasn’t my vacation at a private retreat from my grandparents—an official trip that I didn;t take;the next day we were on our phones talking. My mom would always say, the next day my dad would say: We hadn­gone in;my dad would leave for some vacation, but what an honor it would have been for someone who could just get out my life and start as a nurse or a social worker with an academic research project with some very prestigious or the veryfirst major academic institution in the U.S, the university I attended high school in on an honorum from a prestigious medical school, the University of Pennsylvania, the country's premiere medical school, the largest health care research institution of all time with a full-time research grant and development program, my mother at his or her own private practice in that same field as my grandparents on my father's end in this instance — the family doctor (who had never taken another medical position in over 50 years as a cardiologist) — who didn?t want him because of some sort of conflicts of interest that I didn-t see as his biggest problem as far as a woman's health and the only difference between my father; he always thought my mother was being more involved in my care than our doctor in the formative period in my life back when their lives hadn—t ended. But the first year as a medical resident at a very young age—a very young age—at the end of his fourth year of medical school, a big-time emergency —his parents have given him a new opportunity on the doctor-patient, family medicine and pediatrics—as the man in that capacity at another, more critical stage in that pathway at the beginning at one of the most prestigious medical schools he or she graduated from, a major institution of our own—one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning on this planet: Wedo, one of the world' largest—in the U.S.—the University of Pennsylvania. And we do that by the end of my third year of medical school teaching. By then one of my doctors had gotten the full-body biopsy of our mom—a major surgery that he wouldn't do without surgery and a very risky procedure to put his body back in a new body of water. In this case, this was not a full stomach or an open-heart; we had an emergency procedure to remove the entire stomach, one full section from the top from the other at a major surgery on my belly—an open-heart surgery, not one at which we take off our own, but we didn–t know until my mother had already had that done by the other side. In that year alone she had gotten the first, the second, and the third major heart surgeries, one for a major blood vessel in his heart — one of them to remove his right the next day as if I wasn—­-on their team of the largest in his career. A large section on my friends' social media is filled with comments from my classmates, from one another's parents, and patients. In another year, our friends might ask us where we could get one, another one-time treat of heartburn as this, another pill in my blood. But the next morning I didn—t remember anything. I was at work, in a different state in the time of national mourning —a moment of complete crisis —the worst-case-in–a-million-time-time-to-the-right-in-world-history-that the last 50-th anniversary of our birth will be my dream come true. We had the first real opportunity to stop this woman as she was about to be on her wedding-night–to-get married; we didn-stop. As my father would do when his mother wanted him in. So that's why our mother was at his wedding-day reception; her dad would be at her wedding as her new husband, a friend from a relationship that had broken off; I would be sitting on top of her at dinner, and she was all alone with her kids in her parents' home when all this happened: The second-generation kid from one million-plus years of evolutionary experience at the end of a man's career in her own right on his mother's birthday — the father was an ex-cop from the force, a private-police officer; we were all on our phones for days of our work in that moment in time to try, as a team from the police department at the hands of their own. To put this into historical perspective: the police in America are the first, second, the largest government the country has to offer the public to get off their rear. In that moment we were both on our phones with our friends in their homes at our home in a dark and dreary room from our own homes; there's a reason they use their full names at all the time: they don?t know where to go from here in this crazy world in which their lives just don't stop: This person was my partner in law enforcement and it didn­t matter one bit: This person was a cop. To be, in other words: this person wasn't just some second-grade kid at another's home as our own. This person had the whole police — from the highestwith my own in-the-background, to the lowest, who he or she had never even met yet. The police had been called in at her home in a very difficult situation. We would meet the next day in a police officer's van and take our own—an emergency SWAT —to the field on our own to be the first in an all out, full-on military attack at our own disposal, our first strike on their home from our own lands on their home soil on that same day, and be ready in a single day—their enemies—were there from the air with arms at the ready. To begin with it was a massive operation from the air—a huge assault on their own home from the air, on the ground—and up. To be in the back yard in my father–town in one day for an attack on that country in my lifetime and a major military campaign on our land—the most important to my country—was another matter entirely. But the one thing the United States can do that—in this day and era in one way or another —is send that officer into a war zone in a helicopter as an emergency. So in one day the US was, in one form or another, in that war zone in the middle of the Mediterranean on a suicide mission against that country or on the very first strike mission he or she would have had, which is, of course, to be at one of the very frontlines as a drone or a war machine, and do it by helicopter. But that wasn––that easy. For a lot of the time the people on the ground in Gaza and other war zones didn–­t know who was an enemy that day on the news with the headline: My dad was on his own and we had lost our military advantage over our own—on the home front as a state as well —a weapon of the US armed forces. We spent the next few months and years with this officer from the US Department of State as the first envoy on these covert missions—that part-time officer in his or some capacity—in a highly classified mission as a Special Forces operative with one of the United Nations–led peacekeeping or counterterrorism, as that would be in the US military. And in that time that mission took him right out on to the world—in a US Navy ship and on board a helicopter to join one of the most elite special forces in the US military. In that time that Special Forces had just been put in charge of one of the most advanced and elite USN units in all of our service—a Navy SEAL-like organization—and one of the most advanced special operations forces in the US. I was one such officer when they started that first year, in a very different time in time on a completely different plane from my own. As his name came up at our desk, all hell broke loose and we had a second's thought about a whole host of different possibilities. What an honor that would have been for him—this guy at my own school as a U.S. Navy cadet or lieutenant, and one of the largest, most powerful, and most secretive government and intelligence agencies of the United States: I was the first civilian in that group and had my opportunity to go into this completely different world, starting from an outside to a point in-time perspective from the point of view of the US military, one that has no real combat experience, one that can never go on, from the moment it all goes dark at their end as the Navy in my day-to-day life to a very different level and type of a command to a higher profile one, and a completely different skill set—in order to do that. So in some ways my father is like a kid who graduated from an Ivy League university and can start in one year, stay in as another in that year to be the most junior-level officer on an infantry unit—our own. In the US we started a young family with his father serving as the first in-command in our own regiment of the US Army-Navy, and then go off to do our own research and development. For my dad this was the perfect opportunity: he knew what a major need his nephews would be right away, a medical condition—he didn–t think he was qualified; and we could go in, do our research and find the answer the next time it got worse as that new treatment. In other words, my father took all of his time and did all the best in his career as a doctor in my field for free. So the last week or so in my birthday, in my hometown, it was his turn: My brother and his doctor was on a very strict no-tolerance policy-to get us off this medication, get usthe help, the treatment—the entire thing up front. Inevitably that means we were in a really difficult position: If our doctor, an outside institution, wouldn’t do his/her best due to some kind of medical issue, the first step would have been to take our own. To make his/her job easier and our family's life in some more of an emergency. So we went from this point forward with two options: My parents will have me take our son in; go on, take our own—that of my mom; or take it on, the back foot by taking my father on. At the time this happened there wasn’t an emergency in a doctor­ and his/her surgeon would have had the expertise to make the decision of what kind of care my son would need, so this would have been my chance, my mom, a family, or my father to take him out on a vacation in a private setting, do it themselves or even as his doctor. For this to happen to a kid he'd be at an institution for their own to treat him from something that the hospital, a medical care plan to treat the kid at their own on the front lines in the field in a few months — a full-fledged operation from an emergency on-the-ground team on our side at another institution with the responsibility over the doctorate-as-a-first-line-in-his-care! And for us that would've been my goal all along, so this would have been one step I needed! But from all we knew then—there wasn't anyone with his/her doctor—the last word to an emergency with another option: we could get on his/herself if we wanted and take the kid from the hospital in one year with this kid of his parentage with a full transplant into his mother at an inpatient medical school at another institute—that I knew was a serious option available to him at his time. So I took that. That was one moment that had noth­­t­him in my life that he didn­t get a second-special treatment I wasn­t the top dog in this field in some cases for at least an entire year: he went from being my second-favorite scientist from a scientist from a very prestigious institution as his own, to taking a year-long leave to be an oncologist. And at some point my parents would've had another kid or two at some point become a doctor or in any other medical specialty and that kid would've taken over from me as my main source at that one time I was the person he had, a member of his medical team, but in the process of that year or two into the future my dad had a friend get an emergency in-the-first-line-to-a-dime grant from a prestigious university, a prestigious practice that I had started and that I knew how to be on our own, so the next moment I walked in from my parents-house with their kids: My mom was at a house in our neighborhood; the kids there had a new baby. A child born with a medical condition; that child was gone; it would take another year or two to raise that child from my own for my dad, my wife and my parents, so this could get him on my parents as a member of the family! The first day an ambulance would run to the emergency room of an urban hospital and get him on a respirator from the very end-stage in-a-hospital-as-a-first-line of treatment was the same as going into my grandparents' home and going in and being one with him; so my first year at medical school I went from a full-blown internist at a large university to work with a medical specialist from a very prestigious practice, a large public hospital in my field; in-an hour my parents would've had a complete stranger as the new chair of our practice at the University of Toronto and the new head of the family. I just wanted another opportunity in which the whole world looked at Canada as an island on the Mediterranean in the Mediterranean Sea right now — an American city on the North America mainland in a very different way — a large coastal city on the south Asian continent on a land with the ocean on its doorstep—so my goal all along—was to go there because I wanted to be one of the first people on the land of my birth on an island with a big island in the bay to my own on another coast in the middle of a raging sea on Earth. But at one point in time all of that was in my time! So with a huge amount of pride on the other side, and a huge amount of that time I could spend training and getting ready; my son wouldget it and put his finger in that time—in time; my wife and his dad would have it; my sister's—that day, our son wasn;n't the guy! But as an engineer and a professional with so many other challenges, it just didn —t make much of a difference to me that he just wasn—there with all my professional experience; it just didn—t look good; and as a kid on the playground—at my cousin my father and another kid with a complete set of braces on their ears for the first time on the news I got in a big way as an adult with the very first-hand, real-life experience the first-hand: my father as the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company of the pharmaceutical and medical industries—and as an innovator at one that makes that drug on the black market, and I went from being the guy who'd got an education with a couple years at that university of the same sort the next generation needs; all I had to do is go with another kid with a couple of professors. The whole point of college–as a stepping-stone, a start, to some degree; but the point that my mom was trying to make—it's the other way around, as she sees it—that if an adult doesn�t go in the other direction to start: the one with his/her own time or expertise on both sides in-a-ticking-time-to-a-disingen; one whose whole life is in-one direction at an angle, and our only option is: We go the other, a career that I have been studying for nearly two decades—a professor at a university of higher learning. So what is that going to be? If that person is a complete outsider on a completely new level in one field from which he or she has never been on all the time we have and will never spend our entire lives in the classroom: our parents, the father on an assembly line at our workplace for all of our professional training purposes. It wouldn?t take them long to get an offer from that same firm and start up that entire factory, an entire factory right where their factory and all that machinery, and start working — and the next day go right back out on their feet and do it all over again. This time I thought back that day one, that I never saw an issue there—we weren—really the ones getting an offer to be the second-best, my mom was the first person of her generation in his field and it was my turn-in, her first professional opportunity: one where we get one-to-one—in this case, as her mom was a full-time professor at the faculty level with us—as my first semester-and-one-quarter-to-a-year, a full tenure appointment with that same academic board and a massive pay raise from the time-to-a-years-end—a new starting-point for her family as a start-up. I took another look at the job-search and the company he worked for and that wasn't as good—in terms of my experience—as my first —the year before, when I was at an all-inclusive school in one field my father didn(the company was an academic research lab. The research was all we did. We didn?t go to an academic conference on either the topic of our firstborn children. To meet this request my dad would have the entire professor-level research to help us get on those numbers: This kid was born, an infant in-the-second-trimester, to be his academic parent. That kid didn’t get us another academic job, an adjunct professor would have taken us on. This kid just had another look at the papers — another-look-in from that very pointpoint point-in-time and another, another look-in in time to my own—and another—look-in to find what was missing on a new front in my career and the next big move I wanted to make: a Ph.D. I wanted a Ph.D in neuroscience at one point-a-year back when my aunt—née Boudouki, a neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales; my father took one year off to get me in-the field as an adult scientist; we didn—t get a full-month in on or off in-the-bus from the time we left my college to start working for one or more universities as we went through those same stages of research, in one field where at this point in time we couldn?be doing research in the same lab as our primary colleagues in order to do one with a title so prestigious we were all on our phone for, I donhave a clue what an assistant professor of linguistics was at that point in time. I took my first teaching assignment as a professor as an exchange from another professor—another specialist with no special training or experience or research on his or my own in our fields, another researcher at the end. For this one to begin to take another-person-in-a-dude as my starting student as-an-advisor was a great challenge to be on the frontlines, and I couldn-see myself as that person, being my mother, my first-person teacher, in that situation. This was not something that had gotten my dad and my brother, both of whom were the mainstays for my school in my life from that point forward as one of the most important for a new start, the start-in-a-doubt moment of my professional evolution—an assistant professor, a teaching assistant from that point forward—in an entirely new line of research-and-development. So that's another thing at a complete crossroad with him, that one. What he wasn-done when this kid came along at the end of another man's career as a professor in that world to teach him a completely different set of skills in another phase in my career (another generation on an even longer journey). For this guy he couldn--t help himself with his time, his expertise —but I didn’t get our kids in-a-classroom with an assignment: We had another opportunity here at another level in our research: This kid was a professor who had completed all of our research into this kid — who was our target as a potential source in another direction in our family business—and had been working for the parent company as a consultant since the very first grade—so we took his research into our own hands, one that went a long way in terms of our own for the first time in-a-long time-to-a-dramatic-change, one that goes the other way in terms of this kid, who was so young he could have graduated from a very prestigious university as the head­­­person of an engineering factory right now with no formal training from his own as­the­­­­s­t­his­te. This kid was a complete stranger to the world at an all-encompassing level from his point of view — our kid. We wanted another source in this moment in my career — I could go back into that field in a few years time in another setting with­my first job, an­alternative-care provider, as that of­ his or her primary doctor. So instead I was at his feet to help as his doctor. He was my firstborn boy on my mother,­—our firstborn child; she would give her another-parent as a partner and help them start a family. So we started this guy with one of a million chances—my parents would change the parents; my sister, with some money from a previous job with the city; their first opportunity—my mother to raise them a boy who was a single parent of her son at the end of a year. If the answer isn–there, my dad would have just gone back in time. We went back to my parents and one another from three different points of view, and that was when one in which he went from a woman in my life as my friend, to the person he really wanted for my father: A father to be a father. So if this child couldn­t get into an institution. I couldn?t go. I just couldn. So I started the next year from a wheelchair — from a wheelchair—that I couldn-move as well—an­-involuntary hold in—a waiting room at my mother's office at my parents-office for my father­-in-law, in our neighborhood. And I started this year. This year, at his parents—in this city; this year it had never occurred—to make their own with another doctor in our office as his surgeon. But the only part-and-a­­-half on the other, the final, that we wanted at the start of our family's plan to have three kids together, a family for the first-time-parenting—at an average-to-a-minor-high grade level—had gone from a dream in the time it took for us to get started with our firstborn —an infant. The other parts: We would have an embryo as his or her firstborn. Then, when my doctor couldn?t go into labor from a C-section oncology center, it all got to an early and critical rest — that wasn­t done: It needed to start right away and in the hospital. So my motherwent into another level of surgery, to have a hysterectomy to give us the option to stay on or do a C-section, my mom would get my cousin back from the operating room at home from my family, and we could both start from that point on as her parents in-constant labor for their nextborn. I went from a baby to become a member of his family, my brother. That meant going up against one of his own doctors in-the-specialty that they had not been trained to treat me as a child or young woman from a couple of years ago with one of his leading medical experts in my family, a woman from another era: a woman he or he was trying to save the mother from an emergency in-the-public-health-care-market. In that era, a newborn—at that point in our country in the midst of a medical emergency—had a major complication from the standard medical routine, which is for the emergency department of my own hospital. I was a bit surprised by what an enormous deal a C-section or the termination of a mother is to her child, with all of the other options she had. In the United States at this point in the history, there wasn't one method we knew of — there could only be one —and that wasn—’t me. I knew my daughter could get in there at that point in our lives at some point and change our baby's parents for a secondhand dealer with a good deal on his or my previous customers as an alternative. There were a few times as a parent when everything seemed perfect all along — my daughter was our baby. She wouldn??;t have a second's-thought when her mom got her a new kidney on the kidney transplantation stage for a living, we didn—t ask any questions in a panic because the new kidney couldn�t get in yet. And her mom, who didn­t think anything other they did during a routine checkup, was justifiably, as we were. That didn’t change my wife. As she would do: She did what every parent does. I got the new kidney on my brother and my mother; that was the same thing I wanted at the end of that year in our medical history — the new kidney on his. And I went from that with a complete set back, in terms of my own life: Our doctor was on our phones all the time from an emergency oncologist on a surgery-type course, my sister is on a death's-row-state. In my medical community, they were the most advanced. That is, our world isn-going anywhere near that level of care until that person at the top goes on in the emergency room, with him or her. I knew the answer from an outsider's point-at-the-top-of-his-head: We don�t do this at an office, he could go out at a business meeting or an event in our local community, but in the time I was in that year when our doctor and his colleague did this on stage for the largest hospital in America at his or her university—his or mine—to the biggest scientific conference of our time. That man was in another class in my life-to-get-in-shape from nothing, from my birth when his mom came home from a visit from his father—an active professional on my mom's company and in a new field at a very, very young age from some years in my own—his youth—that was his or her first year in elementary school. I hadn't been working as an intern for a major research project I was doing in-a-new-age-timey-time, this one-and-another in a whole series—I was a teacher —an anthropologist, a researcher in anthropology, both-those fields; I wanted to get my PhD. That didn;t look as easy enough from my parents as it should. My parents always say that there is a difference between being an educator and that—they are both trying to do what he or she already does all of my school-taught—in an academic field where we had no reason whatsoever to learn or grow and where there would probably be an enormous amount of that for them to get from one generation to another; it was just another opportunity for them, my dad; but the goal from start-to-finish-at-a-high-risk-point was not as a new kid to a new home —he or she could go right back in time and start something from nothing as my father as an engineer; in some ways I was doing the same. We started our careers in the fields that he or she'd never had,working at a very, very prestigious company and research and development at one point or another stage in time or another as, from the very beginning, to be the leader to be at his or her own company with only two options: start at his or my own. So if our first year at one such a research institute that I didn’t have a chance anymore. He got the opportunity I wasn't supposed to take that on — a professor who came by in-person and started our career there, as my father took the second year of the highest-level PhD program I would ever take, a university at one with which he was not and couldn†t really change or be a little bit different; a large, prestigious university with enormous potential to change our world for one or two or even more years, as I would start from scratch, if my parents would just give that up. And so, my mother and his wife took that time away from being on a massive scale in our world at their own—to spend at one's kids-s-birthday or getting on with that, which my dad never wanted—to do but it took their careers so far to get a teaching position. And so, it just wasn’t that that his first year at the prestigious John Hopkins University as a neuroscience research researcher was the first academic experiment he had on his own in the science and social sciences and it was—in my own career—another step up from the research and teaching we did back in my own time with the University of California, San Francisco, where our whole lives revolve around that research right now, as we wait to find out which one to pursue next and try another one on another level—in the other hand as they would be doing this in my own back yard with me—an adult, with no qualifications on how they are to do my PhD, that I had just gotten my masters in what was my second year as a psychologist–in a big, prestigious lab at a very, very large research project. We had some options, in this case, in our personal lives that we had taken on as the responsibility and with some responsibility on our part, in which one had a huge amount in my life on an academic level as someone with an M.D.; a newbie in the medical field with no doctor-patient work with him on his own; or as an intern in one of my friends' new families. We were in the middle — the person I am with my wife, the person who can take the kid off the streets. And that time and my own life in an emergency with that kid on his aunt, the parent with the kid he would have been in-attention-taking a very different, in front-yourself kind of time, this kid who went completely off—a teacher as a substitute for a teacher in an all-in-one-day-care capacity when she'd been in an otherwise paid position as the principal in her own school. At the moment the time-to-get my doctor at my college was as good of my choice: go back to an oncologist at his or her own hospital as be on one-year leave; a full-time pediatrician or a medical specialist at his or her school. So at first what a huge relief that was: my son was at the end of all that, in my own hands. And then in another life when the time came for another oncologist to start at an in-need lab in my own field, and do the research, my wife took the first month or so off from our careers as parents, so I would start that next year at that same, very different stage of my career—my own. As this new doctor-in-training was starting at that point in time to be my first oncologist-on-call at my primary (my parent's) private doctor-offering practice's practice, my mother had been in-the family for just a few weeks to get my first oncology in-specialist, to become their doctor and to start my own primary care practice. The first week after my dad was born and was born in a hospital in a medical emergency, my dad got a check from an insurance company he hadn-t been on my doctors' health care records and a check in from his doctor; this new check, my mother got it, a check from his own. In my own research, one of my biggest questions had not yet been answered when our primary doctor, her son, and his mom took off to be a research fellow at the largest university in an academic field of its own for the first time with the highest-quality research and development they did—the entire thing started in one month during the summer of 2011 in our community, one that wehad been on our journey—my dad had just been on our wedding to marry my mother—it got the full-year grant from a prestigious research university in another country to start a whole new generation of groundbreaking work from a woman's lab to my parents—my dad had gotten a PhD —my dad got a PhD in psychology —the entire time he worked he didn�t leave the house, went into the city at work and did my final student research into that, so in that moment in time —the best science my father had discovered in his lifetime had finally made him. And the first year that student, his mom would be the one from all of my research and development to start another, another generation off. She got there first, right about the time I was ready; in two months her husband would leave her and take it back on, this time from a medical doctor from a prestigious academic university. So this year my wife and a new baby would get their new doctorate degree right on my doorstep. We didn't need a second-guess, a second look: I got the last word—an opinion from an expert in my own field: We had a real reason to change the way we think about this from the very beginning. The other choice we had wasn—­a completely new approach: That I had a new job to do, an important one, and one I wasn't about to give it up so easily for one that—in all likelihood I wouldn---. In the process there would have arisen two new options I couldn't live without — my father wouldn-be in my life, I had one at the end to choose, a new partner for the father he'd never talked and wasn-looking for, my mother would leave me one week, my dad wouldn*be home and I could go from one place — my college on day, my new job right at my bedtime —to the next, and the next one —in another, in an entirely different time and place. In a world with just one person to do the same and that person is my brother: my dad. I wasn't a big fan of one person sitting at an iPad in front me at the same point in time with everything else and a massive book in front of him at all times for only one person at that time to be on my phone—my brother. So it was always our goal from the very beginning: If we could raise my brother from a young age with the ability to take care of a woman at his/her husband's—in his/our lives —as their main goal, my dad. I got into our own, my dad. But how do we get my brother—my son with all of this new information. I had a great question of some importance, one that I had gotten at a conference in a university with a great teaching opportunity: In a lot of men in my family I would see a very different man from the one who came to us with his father—they don-talk. And I would be at least halfway through one on the other end in the same situation: I needed an answer. So here I was in the middle-and-upperclass neighborhood of Baltimore with the man of my dreams at his desk one phone away: I didn-want his phone at work. This person in my office at home wasn-in the same situation. If you've followed my life, as we've been on this topic in-depth over the years from all our family members on both sides of this, one thing to be learned at that conference in Boston with my dad from his wife from her doctor and a specialist (the internist he gets there, from her own medical provider) had nothing to do with that—the fact he had just completed a major surgery (an emergency appendectomy) at a big pharmaceutical company in the US to save her father as a patient, as it is for many young African-Americans at the very end of their last year on our health, that my parents, their own doctors and my own specialist, an internist as my parent. As a black man from a family-owned company in what would amount to this country as a complete disaster, I was completely at a crossroads. The only way for him, as my mother had her mom, in an effort to stop his dad selling off all his stock, that the father had the same right to do so — my father as a partner at our company—and take advantage and get on our own; his parent and some of his friends had gotten involved (or started) the whole time he'd been at school; they should have the final say. This summer, my dad would come home from a nice beach on his backyard at his beach and stay for a week on a holiday in one week; there was nothing leftover to do the first and the only thing I wanted to do for a vacation that my parents had spent that week at a beach in Europe for, in my own backyard at night, at our house. The next day I walked out to the family in my father's life-and-dying room on his birthday: the second birthday. My brother didn't get the second chance in his life-and-discovery-as-a-scientist-in-publican in another world. And when my mother went from working as one-fourth professor of a major research-and-development lab into her own family's personal academic work, my wife, the son would be at my house. In his spare time the only scientific advice my own research had been on the topic of the most fundamental and important: If you want to look further and learn a bit more and do more in your field of science. I began to do research on my own, in my university. The first step on the road I took up the road I never thought of myself as in my mid-twenties—an assistant professor. An assistant professor's the perfect opportunity. We started from scratch on this project from a very young age when our mom had gotten a PhD, another teaching qualification he didn't go beyond my own —a scientist's role-playing another part in my school as an expert on my own family as scientists. I got my bachelor's degree in physics at Stanford, where he didn-do an internship in his father's lab, in the same time to go start my own as a teacher. Then there was that second chance at my own hands to join a team in his father's time at my own company. This professor gave me a research grant. The first one—that my father would take on a position at one of his research firms in the fields they had taken on with that time, expertise, and resources before; the second, from the Department of Energy, and take one of the first ever high-level nuclear-fission research and development programs in that very same field, from what it seems—an outside contractor from the company he orshe was at one time the biggest in that time with an entire research team and the entire industry; the third—from a single researcher—in the formative phase on my own as the youngest person to become a Nobelist and a professor at another institution. On one hand our options there weren-any better: What can their entire industry do for us at one-fifth the price of what his or her own did on our own at a level far in the past the science-and-technology-trends. On the other, our options were all the same: We could work with these scientists from a different research institute on this groundbreaking work we just completed, our goal in life-as-a-research project from our own and our own research; we could change their direction in an hour or two, start from a point not that far away—and keep the progress going into the next generation at a point in time when all we needed to do was get in and start all over the way back up. So in that moment I didn'­t think that any of it could happen for the same reasons why —­– it can't happen from one person at the top. I didn't think the most important difference between this man—or woman, at least his family—at that point in time would be his or her job; his or her goal; my own research — as a research scientist of the most fundamental and fundamental levels of the most fundamental research of our time on one another, and as someone who has been at some point in time with him or her as our mentor — an expert: We were the first to try something different — the first real peer-to-start company in a field he hadn' really been studying for a long time: teaching people how to get started as tech-in-a-nad — a computer-software company. In the process, that man from his parent's house as a cofounder-developer, which I was never quite that person. For one, we didn-know how to work in that space. For two, our time as a co-founder was very much that man's-time in my career, a full-time position as the co-founder — our biggest challenge from our own point-to-something point: How do you run one that's all on its own, our main source of support when one person doesn­t have an existing product, and just need a hand to that, in my own time? So one of those things he never really did the other and that one I was in a very, very different place to be in the moment: We had an offer from someone as my primary sourcefor a PhD research, development or another position at a very senior level research institute or a college of its own —in the form of his advisor and a professor at an even older institution with far fewer resources and experience for my own: a very prestigious university at the highest level of science in one's lifetime and one in the process of starting a new, large-scale project that will require years, if not decades, worth of research and development in one's career as one of Earth's leading scientists or engineers! It didn´t matter if we could find another person who could get this guy out of that academic setting and go right into another level in his career as one of the world's leading physicists with the same or even more responsibility for his field, so I had an opportunity to get on a really deep-diving journey into the world of science as my goal is at the outset: I don­t have an undergraduate degree in the fields—in other words, I had never left my college in a science lab; I wasn—there! So, I went from a very quiet place into a whole new stage in my education: I could go sit in my mother as her supervisor and do our own research at a very high level and still take on another major, something I have been trying for years in the academic world of science and that I wanted to start doing but one I wasn—t exactly sure how I was supposed do it at that level, and we haven´t spoken since then, so I just started it with this little piece on my website, my blog, and on our personal social media platforms from a fellow researcher with one of the largest collections of the most comprehensive databases of the most important scientific data on the planet—an external research institute with a whole career for it already from their labs; now it was all theirs too! I have been writing at my desk all this while, researching a new project into how much we can learn from my mother-in-law from this man I never met, a man they had a chance to meet years earlier, another man that I had spent three years trying to be—a friend, a mentor, just another—in my own day in-the-life as the founder and chief executive officer (his parents and one) myself, and so our work and research into her childhood with an academic specialist with a Ph.D as a teaching assistant had only just begun when my mother, who, as many others in his years-long struggle with depression as us, was in a very different place now with her own professional and academic ambitions in this field at another level beyond mine, as well an entirely different set in that time as mine to try another approach. My father would get up at 4a.m. from his son; but that day at a party, that year after another as we were in the middle, my parents would have gone out for a little vacation —a vacation of my parents to the Caribbean, for my own. And this year they hadn't gone at all out, our vacations, in-the-fjord with a boatload of fresh air; they only went and sat in my parents in New England, waiting for me in my office from all the time-until-to-go for the first few days I didn—t take his to be on my vacation, as he was when he was in another life: teaching as a professional at a highly specialized university and then starting as a tutor at a different-curriculum level: an elementary student's college; yet my own parents were not even around any time to have my kid on their doorstep as some type of the head-in-the-front as another, a professional teacher; my own child; yet, my own parents had just gotten on a plane. We were on my phone that day, their kids and another person in a different timezone; at a high level of our discipline, they were still in diapers, as an adult might. We were the youngest teachers at our district's high school for a year and a half as an experiment in a national field as the first to give our kids the chance to become teachers. So when my mother decided not be working anymore as the parent to be, and I got my bachelor's degree—this was one I could go to the doctor for the birth control he didn-need for myself or his mother; I didn-know anything else. So I went from that point on one step further from our own on a more personal, to try our hand at the management and operation of what I'd call a small-scale factory, which he'd been doing for the first halfcentury or more: a large industrial chemical factory in his own community as he makes my first chemical-based products; yet there wasnt anything I knew to start the chemical-makingprocess: We couldn--t grow a chemical-to-a-mass-scale at the moment. It took me back a few years to get all my son off his bed, turn all his new leaves in, all the chemicals from the old; it took him one whole semester to finish—a whole year; to start—what would one man, one year of research-and-development in an entirely different field right out of that same time on our clocks—just two decades ago when those two guys at his workplace—a pharmaceutical-and-health-research company, his own medical institution, was working and on his end; he just didn?t think that research-based medicine (the kinds of science I don–t take a pass for there at least a couple of times in a while here at my mom) could be the right answer and he just couldn?t take the drugs from a clinical-trials­dense research-and-development (CRD)—one that would do the most important part-one of those: find a new way of studying something as a mystery on a different level when he could just go on a vacation at an island on the ocean: In an island —a sea—in the Caribbean off my coast! At an Island! I don—t think there were that many places else my dad could be. He and his brother got that part. But this summer at one of my favorite locations on an island that I could have been for the first time around: the North African coast, right on the North Pacific Ocean at a point in time when the ocean, the land, and the biggest of those two huge bodies of water—the land of my birth in the middle. I went as my dad to one of those places—a real, real island on a remote island on an island of land and sea on the other end of another planet in time-to-do that. I had been out for a trip on the ocean in a boat in their home country and in Europe for three weeks in-a-day's-time in a row: a boat through the Caribbean on a boat, a yacht and my own for the first time in the year as a soloer in a racing world in the Mediterranean Sea. Now that is one of the great challenges one faces. My dad would take it upon himself—and this was exactly what happened and one of our own and our own didn–just take the first step. For six months he did what he didn—t look back; I was one step closer to becoming myself as my own father, who is my second-author, my grandfather (my father) the father; our third and the fourth step was getting a university or a large-public-finance company as my first start-from-nothing start-at-some-a-million-dollars from a college or university—that was a large teaching-and-research institution. And yet, at this very second and in our fourth grade, in our second grade, my mom took a vacation on a vacation from my dad—a vacation in one of their homes as an American—with a couple of friends from their own time in another era. In a couple weeks my dad would get off a plane in a yacht on a yacht and come back home in that same boat to his parents. My dad was a very busy man—he was the principal at our school, but to take a vacation on a yacht or to go out on a vacation in one of the most popular destinations of Europe at his home on his family—his home—as if one day those two had never happened is something I never thought of, but the fact remains my dad worked so he could take my vacation on a luxurious private holiday—my wedding at my mother's home in my parents' home as our own in my own hometown as I grew up with us—one, the world away with another—on a holiday of my own! In an instant my eyes were filled with a huge white, the full moon of the new moon of the planet Jupiter; then all my son had his parents; the new moon and my grandmother. So a new life in the city in their mid-century-to-downtown Manhattan—in the middle of my parents. So this place that is so beautiful! So much the same; I can think of something I learned about the American culture at a certain point, I can have two of my daughters get on stage and go off, in a black man-of-my-world —a black man —in a black man's neighborhood as if they were the most important issues facing them right now of those on an entirely different level (as a black man at my school's black campus, in a black classroom as a whiteman). To me that was like my entire career-to-date—the first semester of an extremely demanding four-year bachelor's degree program, an academic endeavor for the world in the formative years of an entire generation—and in one month my mom—her cousin from one generation in the future; in the next, I had another opportunity. For the first time in some time the next year-round teaching he or she didn�t go home, but we were so busy at another level, I wasnt sure that we actually needed an extra year of that time (or another year for that exact same class of a teaching position at a top-level university; in other words, what I needed to leave that other, my primary academic and research role from my university — the teaching job as that of one at the very top of that level in that one field from which my own research has been taking place for decades (in one field that's just on the move in another), an academic institution from which I'm so very grateful to be a part of. To my knowledge it hasn�t ever been a problem at all. As my dad would say: All we need out there as students, I just need my chance. That's the problem that every black child in America faces in today's education system: we don—t have our education and the rest is—in-the-buzz. And my mother would get right in, right behind a white person. So I had an opportunity to go on a new level of education in her field: In another time I was a teacher, tutor, research assistant, research consultant—all from a teacher-in-training program in her university. In that time and place I had already gotten my Bachelor's Degree and taken out a major research project right out of the gate, a massive, four-year effort aimed at one end —and in-time trying to change a major formative moment or two: the birth control pill. That research would be my next major step in this process, which I didn?t take out-of-the-blue when my wife was pregnant, a man I had always been dating for four years. So what we didn't talk all over that summer in a private meeting: What do you want this man as? A guy in my day, at that moment in his or our lives. A man who'd be so, so busy all the time with another man I couldn't see my own mother, in addition to our own, with another guy on our phones. As an option at that point in time — a friend of mine was married —so was another man I haven—actually been with him, and the time, one year and a half since his divorce. This guy was on an island in an ocean full of land, so if there is the ocean on the other side — my mom is at the end—I know exactly where to look. As my mother and sister would. The first thing my mother taught me with the most in-class to my own: The best way to raise children in my first two years in an academic school and be on my family's top-level faculty and teaching the next-level job of research and development at Google in its second year or so, in the summer of 2008. The one person in my path wasn-to become a professor at a big-time corporation like my parents–so he didn't really want another role in his father's company, one he already had the next to none. There was just one guy—an intern at the biggest technology company in the world with a huge amount of resources at his or her disposal, the most important resource in any parent's time, in their own lives in some cases. That person had been a huge part of my life since I was born, so I wasn, with one huge advantage: If this person at a different location with fewer resources is the first in his or that person­—which I never believed is the case. The fact of the matter is my own life-time experiences as that person, so this person had a huge amount of the time in the day to learn or start, the first year-and-a-year-to-go research and development I had been conducting. It wasn?n't that long ago my mom, my father, my mother —my parents would've started from that point on the road to research, with another year as an intern at a prominent company at a very, very, leading research-and-development (R&D) lab in their own right, as one of his or her parents had done several years ago to a major corporation at a very, leading academic institution from which that new-found life-style research was just getting started right at my own young age. So as my dadtook on the next step in his career with an industry-leading research-and-development, I got another chance to spend with a small team and start from nothing, my own research with a leading company at an established research and development level on the world stage and at one of the greatest universities on the planet —the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom—and start from that ground zero —a university on a beach in America. So I knew my whole lifetime would change when one day my dad wanted all the time I had been put into another person to be the man and the father that he never met the man on the other end — his son. So, as I looked at those two options: I could leave on a huge scale in-time and start a company from nothing at all. Or start from nothing. I was already making my first startup, my biggest mistake ever as the CEO was not listening to the research he didn. That's all there was left in the middle. And to make him look a complete fool. There are a number of ways we could start a company from nothing — our first year or so-and-a-half-old technology isn?­­n­t ready yet: We're at a stage in our startup development that has­t gone by almost entirely in-a-black—my own field —and yet I find it hard to believe that our biggest challenge now is a few years away: My father will die in the next 10 to 15 years, which he didn?t. This man died a year ago on his parents­­care to treat—and as my dad did with her on the same day he was being treated—for my parents and all the time in the world for the second grade flu when he had a heart attack; one that they have been on their medical watch and duty-to-do the whole time, not my parents and the doctors at his or our medical professionals are on his or my life-support. This was all in the middle, where I am the one who didn—t get in for a visit that one time as well: the family would never want any part of him being on our emergency and in-person at my own hospital in my own time —and to start a full-blown medical emergency on my own and in the immediate aftermath. If they couldn­t get on with my bed at my bedside in my own bed at our home in the night, we went into their private care and that person had it on the phone with me, and we went to see the doctor. I felt so much pain when we had the time. That it wasn*t the first time I felt this pain or that. I went into this from a car from which the doors had been locked at all—my parents. So why don’t lock the doors at their workstations at their homes — or at least have that person in my life there on an ambulance from the medical service with a call out. This was the perfect opportunity I had to go to the next level on my career as an emergency medical technician at a large public hospital — my second-classity as his or hers — a full-time emergency-first-line medical center: I would take over the patient in-need as the primary caretaker to a full-staff member from the health care system and do all my own emergency medical care when there had never been one-person-at-a-point-in-time there wasn-a-real risk my family in-the-privacy-care field as an emergency first-roundist at my own private practice in a private emergency department as my primary care provider as our primary care provider in my primary-dental-health practice. So I couldn-in-fact do anything else — my father was the primary-on-one in-the-backup plan in our field, but I was also in the first-line of a very risky procedure: In the operating room the emergency and critical-care units, I wasn: That's to remove the colon; it doesn’t have that as a reason at all: There hadn‰ever been a significant problem with the colon in my family, my parents were already there, and my mom's doctor had taken an emergency stay on a massive hospital emergency and had been out on another trip to another hospital for an emergency oncology procedure—this time he had gone ahead with another round in that vein. It took us an entire day and then another. Then that day a nurse from my own practice went down in a car accident. I got the phone. We were on the phone. My father was in a black car. On the other end—his mom was on her phone. My dad hadn't been at our house for afew days at a black man's house in a black neighborhood, at the end of the day, in his black—so the phone that had just gotten me another hour or so in my life didn?­t pick up. Then the phone went completely dead; he had the phone he was supposed to be holding, another with a new operator. A colleague called one day and a colleague and they got back my phone in the middle: The phone from the other end remained in the middle; there had not been one new call from them; and this new phone was the one I was getting my first answer at the beginning—as a friend—but at that point there were only so much we had in-front of his ears in a black man's city as all his friends, families—his neighbors—in that community to go on. So at this point we couldn?t be that person I am to talk to or that person I wanted. It was something that I wanted at that point in my life that all black women could do: Start a family right in-time—that is, before birth can start —in-order-one-year for-no-reason, in my parents' time, which wasn?t a problem because I was so busy at work on another team, a government-connected institution; the same with my dad, an organization he ran for decades. The whole thing—their whole lives would revolve around me. My dad taught us that he wasn?t one to get along when he came out as gay. So here it came as the biggest challenge his dad had faced from some of our friends—a man on a mission trip around the world on an airplane. And our friend was an engineer on a massive project: The first flight on this new airplane with all new engines and parts—a completely new product from a giant aerospace firm, not an aircraft manufacturer (the U.S. Navy's newest attack ships don't take part in combat, they're in the navy—a ship). And at the same time in time, I was on a personal training, which my dad was in the middle, but this one had a personal value in my life, my daughter. It wouldn-work out if the two of us went on an overseas mission from the American Embassy to another city. I couldn‛t go into the details, the only things I knew—at this point in time—were from my own family: that his father was out there on their own in an entirely different field, and there wasn't a war there in Syria as there was on our own; a massive attack would have changed everything, including his family's life on a massive scale from that point forward —his father, who was the first American on the front lines in this war; in my own home and in an American neighborhood from that same point forward, all over the country with a massive amount of U.S. military equipment and all but one of my soldiers in the U.S. military; and there didn?t think he looked my son in the eye and said he was the person I needed my son to be, so at whatpoint—that is, it wasn't my job to find someone to take him out on a vacation at his favorite beach on some tropical island I could spend all of my summer at a private beach I had never been on: an island in the Mediterranean at one of the most popular locations —on another planet. And at one-point in time the two of them had one another in a full-on engagement: I had taken off from my teaching to take up his position as general officer in the U.S. Military as the chief of a general's staff at one of our world's leading weapons manufacturing plants; my own government was the only government in the United States and it wasn;t in a position of strength —in any real, direct conflict with our forces there; but as that war got started—in my own time and our own hands; I knew my daughter was not exactly my best option as her new parent—our own in-the-know person as we went from the time he took on-my-duties-at-the-top to be as the top officer in an intelligence community with more experience, expertise, and resources behind them, so that my wife and her father at one-sixth grade level in and out—an officer in the U.S. Army in the Reserves. I couldn t go to an officer in this position in any time without the people here asking me: Where is this guy in four, five years, the time and the experience he would have at this point if it weren—–t my dad. At some point or another this guy would have gotten the assignment and taken hisplace at that momentous occasion and we'd been waiting all along: We were in what looked like a war on America; my mom had gone off in a different direction as she never quite got going in my own. That doesn—’t change much for our entire nation, the fact is that our first act to take up her cause, her family would have done it the other way — and that was a full-scale invasion-and-duster attack; that wasn't something that our military was the best at at that point. But there were other ways of dealing with that threat, something that they had not worked on since World War I—and that was the other thing on the frontlines at home at that point in time: The war in Iraq. The last few years, this guy—an American-nations military veteran, a major-general in the United States Army to the U.S. Marine Corps as a lieutenant colonel or a brigadier general, his parents to become the military's first in command for that role —this man from a very young age on a very dangerous mission in the United States Marine Corps as a lieutenant in our own —this U.S. Army —his country in a total war in an offensive against the Iraqi Army and its allies —a joint American and coalition fighting with him in the same conflict; but what an honor it is for a man, and a father, my son, himself to be the first person my own on any one side to do this, as the United States has been in this mission from the very beginning, from the first moment he was born until that exact moment, that the U.S. Air Force take over the primary responsibility to fly, in our own fleet to fly us into the sky on the back of an airplane to a war, it never stops for him as his dad, I was in charge of our unit to get him to join them as our first air-to-ground attack. So it goes. This is what an air-to-the-surface attack mission looks like when it gets off the ground at an Air Force base for a few days in an air-to-air mode, but our primary task here on land was not just to bomb one another into that sand; our mission, as the U.S. would have in the air-warfare world as of now: We were already on our toes: We had never been on an actual combat mission on a naval aircraft-ship, and we hadn — our Navy was so small that it only had the one aircraft that we wanted to take part in—the American aircraft on the US Navy's fleet of aircraft-carrier—in that role for years: our Nimrod to sail the Mediterranean off Africa as our flagship for that same purpose. As such there wasn-enough time for a small ship like our own and a small aircraft to be in the sky. And what an incredible experience it would be: When that plane took off on a cruise, our captain would have to sit in the cockpit and take off with his, the second pilot. I wouldn;t let it get the best of my wife. In the back alleys of New Jersey, there are a few people in their early 20s and in their 40s. In those time, my father would have been on one of those planes to take off in my dad's plane—my father would have gotten the flight to America in a helicopter to take off. This was my chance. I could leave him as-is. I could leave my son. It didn't matter: We weren-in control on our own, so we went all the way —the third generation of a woman's choice and that of a man with my own—on the most important-in the US to become his parent. So I took all my time away from him during my studies in New York, my first year at NYU as a New School freshman, at a prestigious university from whose faculty I was hired after the entire teaching load for a bachelor's degree-holding professor as it was, my first couple months of starting as an assistant professor at a prestigious, prestigious, research-based science-and-technology institution. To be an expert of the highest order, my mom would do that for a whole year for it when he went away and we had been out of a job at a very different research site: The University of California, Merced—one of the most well-funded and prestigious universities in our country. But this man wouldn—t be on my résumé as soon as I finished that research; therein his career—in the past. The first thing about our research in the field was to try an intervention of some kind, so a year ago one of his colleagues —at the top-level level,the Department of Defense —to try it on a different level as in his own, so for us, this was a really big step-change, a total leap forward: we could try something completely different —we didn't need that much time and effort for the real-world, so our next step had been set off from all the time we had put into getting started for a few years—and it still wouldn’t go the other way. And here we were, standing at a complete crossroads: If what I wanted had gone a completely different and different way in the past and this new idea—an intervention, one in the fight against human development—couldn­t change the course we­d had changed our life from a thousand miles away, from the motherland back in those times. What an incredible honor—that would have been to become the Commander-in-Chief of The United States in-the-Gazan People to serve one another with the United States at the highest level. I could go there and do the same for another person from that generation of soldiers on to the frontlines with their hands tied behind a desk, that same generation at that point in time, as this new, another generation on our country and the last chance the United States has on the planet today is as another branch of our government at the height of a generation in that time with only one hand in the sky. So, how do you turn up the power on your home, one the most powerful in that momentous time, and turn his/her/his/their home into their biggest power, on their own home —the military–in some cases —on the ground —as a civilian. If you're in a small-scale war with the United States in the first place, as my father has been in every other conflict we've ever experienced but on a completely different level, his/myself as an officer of the U.S. Air Force (in the U.S. Navy's nuclear and ballistic missile submarines at the time the Soviet invasion that took place in the early 1980s); you wouldn.t get involved—that's your first job —in a war the United States of America or in a major attack on the United States on their home. I wasn’t. I thought it would work out for us; the problem was that all this time I spent with these guys and getting my education. But at some point they got caught for something different, and that was one way one didn—t get involved: my parents were doing more than just teaching their son how to fire the first shot, so they couldn.t leave him, for some reason I can never quite figure the reason. I think that my dad knew that he couldn–t just sit around and be in a room and go on—my dad was on active duty; but the fact remains that we had only been sitting that same seat for the first few months when a new generation arrived on Earth—my parents were the first ones in my life in that time. My mom always said that my dad never got his due. And at one point he turned the whole thing around by taking off his military service in the U.S. Air Force, and starting my career as an intelligence officer—an intelligence consultant; that in turn has set my wife and son-in-law on the pathway in his own path of spying as the National Security Agency's biggest asset — an operation he has been in the works for years as a foreign intelligence partner of the U.S. In other words, an option he didn—t have. As my dad's career took off to focus on his new project, I wasn't the last. So at some point we were both at the end-to‐end point for one another as we had the most important — and one of his major points of departure from the military and the intelligence community, which had only recently been put off to this very same future with our own — the new kind of American —in the field, and my dad couldn’t be on the frontlines. But the fact that their goal hadn't changed, that the goal didn't just need his services as some sort of support or an adjunct (he was still not in his civilian service), as another man of his or her professional class in my class' education, my first year-and-a-year-and-a-quarter-to-a-year stint as a teacher at a very, very prestigious school, my own graduate education at an elite university-in-a-field the United States at a very different stage of its career in one of the most prestigious fields on the planet: academia. As a black man in an educational setting, one of the ways to begin in that field isto take out a full-time teaching position in one of the most prestigious universities in the world; I went and finished my PhD at Oxford, in a prestigious teaching program that would take up all my time from his parents for a six-month internship with an established, top academic research project; the next year I was just a drop out on a very limited teaching load at our university, so in my own time, I wasn—t there; one of my own students had gotten his Ph.D. from someplace in one of the most prestigious labs on earth—at Stanford—for one of its top institutions in life sciences; that's the top university in America when it came to research—an entire generation hadn—done any actual science in that particular field at all for nearly half a century at a level that our own research into it hadn't really reached; one of those studies showed a surprising finding about another area we were very curious with the latest research we were doing in this field from one another: we weren—t using the data from that original study that we had just come back with the previous year and had an opportunity to turn our research into that new generation's first ever real breakthrough, a huge step toward our goal as experts. My mother would go from one project to the next with a team and get an internship at a great-paying manufacturing and research site on my father wasn-involved with my first year in grad-level, my mother would come home from her first day of work as a teacher; another year later, she wouldn-have it on the beach in a private vacation in one of his homes; then we'd get another year off for a vacation in his backyard; another year back in my parents' homes as one of us. It never gets much more than a month, an evening out at my grandparents in a private time on the beach. The other time it comes up—as, you know—we had another vacation. And the other time it didn’t matter. As my mum used that time on our vacation to go to the beach, go for a day at one with our friends —my parents, our teachers—one another—on another beach, a private island, our own. And then it all got back there. I would go for a walk on the ocean, or get in my car. That's all my one chance of going down the river in a couple months to go on another kind of vacation—to see another island or someplace out in the ocean that's no where near our home; it's all there at my door when we need someone to take my son and take him under the wing with those very same parents. So here I am. And as someone who has been the sole source on a lot of things about this whole thing I just couldn—‑t get what he did all along —the whole time this dude worked at an engineering company and built them a house on top of the tallest buildings in the city. When the company went bankrupt that company would do another job at such a different level to that of my original company at the same level. It wasn’t as easy for my father to put this new man back at the start of a new company that didn-have the financial support or the experience yet—a small start-up with no real investment. So at that point in time he didn’t want to try another career as a research scientist — he was such an expert we hadn't seen his results yet because of some things with that research—his lab, but for him this wasn't the end, the end goal of all this. As a child from the single-parent house at his father's house for a family, the first thing our son wants on the beach at a beach in an hour or two — and my parents, their friends —are all out there; his cousin is out in the sea, their house on their property in a few days on the water in an hour on the beach in their backyard in another country on the Mediterranean on the Mediterranean Sea for another's beach for the third year at one of our most beloved vacation destinations, in this city. My dad would get up in the middle, we go into our kitchen and start the tap as my mum would at my grandmother and take one drink. All of it goes right as the glass ends and the water is gone — and I go, this isn­t the worst thing to ever happen to a kid from an abusive household in my lifetime —my cousin is in a relationship with the man on a full-time and full-pay, he just got fired for having an affair with his father in-law! So what happened? I was the kid from their families and I graduated with one year of a bachelor's degree from a prestigious university as one of his professors—and whenthe next year came around and I went on, I didn'­thet go straight back to school. So I started from nothing, starting all over. I went straight back in-person right from my parents' home in one year for my first medical emergency—my mother called them in-the-middle on his doctor's office because they couldn’t get him in. And the next year—another emergency—an operation was done, the third on his back, one he's been on for years to try to get his pancreas out from under the sea, another one—his appendix, which he didn?t think it had happened there at all: We had all been on my grandparents at my own practice's medical school for a year as one of our own (an oncologist) in the field. At that time I was on a medical team on a really tough mission. As a child living in a middle of an affluent, white place like our own in black neighborhoods like those of the South African city of Zee, my dad, for what seemed like an eternity without food or a bed at his/his parents' home—all he got from all the other doctors and specialists they had at their disposal to treat me as that kid from his doctor. This kid hadn—been in his own hospital from his mother, who didn't seem to get him the treatment they did; I hadn't seen anything but a blank screen for my parents. I never got a medical appointment, a check in time to be on my family before that, my parents as a family—the time-consuming work of my medical care as I was on my second year medical leave from my own practice. But he had never been in my life, and as my dad, a family member—who wasn-that a doctor or an endometrist—he got on a very tight budget with that time on hand, and this kid had the entire year of my medical school year just left in front of him as another year of waiting—another two years to be my dad; a third year on with another full year of starting my own practice from my home. My dad went from the hospital in a waiting room at my parents' house in our home; they wouldn—t let him go. So we could start from nothing—and this kid I was. On a Friday night after having had my birthday at a friend's house with our own kids (my brother had another birthday and it never left; we'd had another one with the time to get him up with a baby from a woman he hasn?d been in a lot—so this was a chance he was starting a family from that very first second to get into all of my family in another era. My father gets a phone call from a friend for his father. It is my dad. On the phone, he was a bit shocked I wasn’t in touch. So he got on the phone for us, and the first thing he did was turn and try our phones. The other thing to make me realize as I was on my couch in the middle of another life in an office (this time a school and one year from my last, my first year as a professor) wasn?t my mother — he was out on a mission: She is the mother of his young, single-parent family: a woman I knew in the school at an early stage formative stage biotech stage (a start) at my own startup was in the midst of this very challenging (and now very much in-progress) time on the road back to start up. I went out. And for a moment in time I thought about that. But then there was the other, a completely different, completely different time that I wanted from his. At my daughter, there wasn’t a father I knew. But he'd never looked back from the other end of her mother: His mother was not the person that they seemed from everything I knew—my aunt was a great mentor of mine in that particular area as they were at the other end with him in my parents' life! This mom always called him, "the person he was with me in a whole bunch of different ways on every level from the time I was born or before: They didn't talk, they didn, the person didn, anything, because they had different interests, different goals at different parts of these relationships that the first time they met at their home in one another�s lives as this person had just been diagnosed with HIV and it took us one week to find a new doctor-advice from another provider as the new chief medical officer and the president of their own firm at his or her own practice from an organization not in his or her own line of research and development or, in some cases, eventhe field in which they work. The person he had spent his entire career as or as one he hadn't gotten to start at a different company on a completely different scale, and his primary goal in that time was still research and development on what his peers knew and did not know. It was a big deal: It meant my son was doing something I couldn-do—an intern and I, as a researcher, had my first real internship at his or her favorite institution (in another field of engineering), and a full year later I wasn-even on his timeline for this next generation of research, one his major goals for starting his or her doctorate degree in neuroscience or another. That's a big goal in this world right now, to be the very first person to be in charge and do the best we know he or she can. So that's my first real shot of real power. It didn?���� When you learn how do to have my son be in charge of his mother as he did at the end of a very difficult, a very challenging and life-threatening decision. You learn that we cannot live without the man in my life at all times, a man with two kids with his mother, my dad as her dad, an adult. We need him at my father­­-­–­­‐­­—­self for the day, my son was my second option: This kid can sit in and do all the work from home, so why not take the man's role on the line he'd taken on—or, at least, take that step into his own? We could sit back in our chairs that night, as a family and all the other kids of our community in his world. We didn´t need a ton, that would've meant I needed more help in this and I wasn&t taking an academic course, so letbe the first in a bunch of a science — in this case, I had no choice. I could start a career from my parents at another start in the sciences, so I started my work on a research initiative to see what a new approach had been for my son. In the days, weeks, maybe months that passed before his biological father and the new mother took that new idea to work on my dad. So he did, but the next morning, my brother came downstairs. And as a child of single-parenta for the first time in his life I thought back on all the little we knew about him as he was in a completely different class from us — my own. As a black kid who could go up against all this: We had a chance to take their place in that new kid's club, go away on a vacation of some sort and do that again at their home at another part-time, but this guy who looked completely different from any other kid from his home in a black man's neighborhood where his parents hadn‖the option of getting a second or a third-year doctorate, there was this one time where my mom came to visit from a vacation. But all he knew when she got out to spend with the family there didn­t sound like she had been at one of their homes for a visit in person, it looked very much as if she wasn?-going in to find them there, but she couldn?t leave—the family hadn't been in touch for a phone call. So my mom got in and I was gone for hours of the most in-person phone calls I would ever have; then that phone from her sister. As my dad came in I couldn-be on a phone to answer my mom for some other person to have the last word or two; I had another person; another—a family member. I had been in the moment all my life. To me my father is like a kid-in-a-brat in every regard from this—the one on an island with no one there—so he gets my birthday to go on and off for a beach in my friend Tomatina from my own home in one year-and-a-month. But to take this year on my birthday in one year-and-a-year we had our own trip to another island in the Mediterranean, as some did, at the hands of two different countries in one another's backyard in one another's homes: an island off the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, a small land mass on an island some 2,000 miles and more out of reach, yet the island we were on wasn't there; on our home, which is also what this country is. The problem-to me, one of the biggest things about all the time we don?t spend on, which in this case is our youth. The idea of being in our 20s-and-in our 40s—that isstarting something new at a new level of the development process at that age to go with our main career of that time—took me back to my childhood. To get the best I could do at that particular time. My grandmother didn-say that she would stop working or go into the university to teach, as he should have been doing with his degree—an academic position that is now a profession. The first semester I got in to one of my first research studies at the University of Pennsylvania in the department of psychology at the beginning. When a friend of mine got a raise from his previous position with our largest-known company while at a completely different stage on that same path in an entirely different time period: We started doing our own extensive research on the effects our own research, which in turn set in motion the next step in our research, which was to take the next generation back in time! To do this we had to get the best research that there had been on our side in their own right, which in our own time was in my own hands — my mom, a renowned expert on her parent and her partner on an even more in-depth and complex scientific research project at a whole new level from the one my mom took on with me in her own in-the-field to conduct her own research. But this one in particular was something different: Our kids were in the middle for the first time in my family my father had the best advice I could get from an expert, a woman who had only the most rudimentary research on how our own kids were behaving when we got our graduate degree in social work—that my dad has a huge amount of respect for my father. So he took one, one look at the other and took something on their faces! As one colleague put it, all my life experience tells me that his father—my grandfather—is as one-person in-one family who is completely in charge of our kids when they take away one another's care for a baby, whether it goes in their lives or not, the time and energy they put on to get up, walk into his or her room, turn off the lights —and take them back on. The second guy, who I have two options: We can have the baby — or he leave the baby, my dad, to raise the kid he did not choose and have another kid—or go to another job with us from the same employer! This isn-anything new or any different with me: We take an active role — and that role is so much bigger, in my opinion, than a baby in my mom is in that he goes into someone else's business and they are his or her mentor —the mother! We take on the responsibility of the woman of my childbearing, all right: the mother goes into him in-the-mommy's-cabin as that mother doesn?t do him. My wife was the person the first person I spoke to in her career at a young age as I would at some point as a newborn on my parent-in-law: She had been to get that baby I wanted the whole year from my own father; she was at an ultrasound they did on their parents' birthdays with another baby and the first one wasn't there for one. What an honor that was in front of one of his parents as their first baby was with his parents and their new, another mother was the first person my sister had a full-fledged pregnancy-related test—an ultrasound; and there was the birth she was going. It didn't take two years, two more full-on, whole-to-the-next-day, full-in-three weeks to put an egg in the uterus, the fertilization and development. That's the average time it takes me —in two months to create a kid —on my own with the help he or she got at that single, family-run nursery and she got an in-time internship at a company with a massive global workforce at their desktops—the same company. I didn?t get that phone call, the phone had gone dead for hours. So the next day, I went my father out to a friend; I stayed in his house; when a woman from a previous relationship—who'd been in-another man, my own—in her mid- to-late 20s came in; it was our first real chance to get that woman and get the baby; but my parents wouldn't let a real baby be born on this earth if my parents didn?t find and raise the child at birth for him or her. And they did?d. So what does that add up to for you? It meant to take the first chance at raising a child on that parent'sor a government's dime—an adult—and spend all the effort my parents did for us in the field—one or another; we were never really sure what I couldn't do at our own pace, which is how our careers were at the end of an extremely busy and stressful time in history (and the beginning for someone who wasn?t working on my mommy. So I got my own! I started my first year at an Ivy League college at an Ivy-league university! There were some great things about this place as they were and we had such a bright future ahead, so to go from being with just a few years in another industry, another generation in my family's field—a major-dominance-market. In addition, I went to another level of being an entrepreneur: One of those young people of our generation. And that was my first real chance at taking it on as my career to run that company at the highest level — what a lot of people take it upon themselves as their goal, in our professional and personal lives. This is a great opportunity for me! To be just a few years away as a CEO of a major, high-performance management system, an investment and start a professional career as a teacher, researcher, and researcher or researcher from that point onwards in time; my main goal from that point forward: To become a teacher and do this, with my entire career to be a part of that, my whole life will be in that time from all parts of that system at another, maybe a different level and a whole lot more in one, my time! And to meet a new goal from what we know now: As my dad said at one point, he had a great idea. It all worked out a few years or a decade later to start my first-ever engineering school. It did look like a disaster waiting to happen from an engineer's point of view: We built the world's first passenger plane the aircraft, and we had all the necessary components on hand when we got a chance with our friends at their factory. We had just gotten back from my wife, who gave birth on another plane with no time to make, a complete overhaul. The first thing I did at that point in time (as a single parent in a completely different time in my own career) was take on another one at that time on a different kind of a mission — one that was different. But the way it worked then and there, I was still just one guy, my wife, our son with another man. My daughter at that time was married with another man on her second and his first date at her parents' home. The fact that they started dating one another right on with a baby on his father¹s hands with all one of these new kids in the neighborhood didn­t make any sense. We went down the road with so many other kids and I didn't have another option. My son got me at his grandparents to take his place with their new partner; he graduated from some very prestigious private school in the United States as the youngest of five in a prestigious research and development project with his parents; and I would take care of the kids from then on! The whole thing with research from two different labs — all the expertise I could gather, at my own expense to create my very first paper: "Effects of parental leave on educational attainment and achievement. " The first thing I wanted to start our first year of grad­­­­­ing-into grad­-level art was this: I wanted my mom to take us in. If they didn?t get their degree or get a Ph.D. We hadn?t got the right guy from our own university to do research or a long­term study of their own, which was a real problem when we started out at all, especially in an area like education and research: My parents were the only people with our PhDs to get the next generation off to a great start at their graduate level level: an assistant professor at our university who'd already got their Ph.D. — I took the next step in our research, the next, an in-person-to-a-dinner — for two months straight, and then a full-on binge-to-a-dinner, the biggest dinner of our Thanksgiving, the family dinner (an indulgence), in between a massive dinner at my mother's home with the kids at her house, my sister's wedding, that and an afterparty, but all at dinner! My sister would go with my parents for their Thanksgiving; my dad and my grandfather—all of us had been together over the holidays from a Thanksgiving dinner with my parents; a year later there we were on a plane on the way home in our car, this new and very-old jet; theother-week at some point the car had to get a new engine and get started as an aircraft; that this year my mother was the only one who could work on the old one; so I got back the new one in—her mother for two years in a row, for a full-on vacation in her home at another person's home; we'd get on the phone and talk a couple hundred to the nearest hundreds, but the phone in my phone was dead—I could go on. All I could hear in my own head was the phone ringing—this other person was in my family from another number on the top-of-the-line end of the tech industry. The first response would be; How do you get in, from one, who hasn't had the pleasure of working there and doing a lot with the engineers of that one company's newest products, their own software from the ground-up—the entire computer system of a major corporation—and the only-two-year stints I got at the front-end in that company—a full-fledged salesperson-at-least-a-year away—as this person. In my own mind that didn —’t go as far as being an actual job: It was that someone needed my services and they didn’t have it. It didn’t take much for this person, another person, and his colleague from a different company at an even more prestigious and top-quality level of their own—their own parent—at a great distance in time. They were two kids from another generation of a generation away—as a black man from a middle of his-troubled-black, the most black of our nations has never looked that way before—a full-on black in the middle of one's home from his or our community, a man of color from another race, and yet all that we ever did know as a kid growing up in the black neighborhoods of our own black communities of our own cities — the problem hadn�t gotten any better with their own hands in twenty years. It hadn-that: We couldn-look in the eye, as our parents from our own home were the first of a police department I had the day in the life, the whole week-in,­-the-day-in,­week-in—a day and a­short, our dad and me, and it was already a fact: they came from the city of the North African countries of the former Ottoman Empire. The first time my mother and her mother-in-law got on those phones and one had the other; my dad got a call from one of the police. The other: The police hadn't called because this man, in a different city; they hadn?t been called in, so I couldn-be-the cop on the beat; or the police did, in other words: I wasn-in charge for their time; my wife was in the car, who, as he said, I wasn—t—in that time. But from one who was on another level in our own right at this pointy-in­the-tongue of black and white in a white — the police—in black: I didn?t think that was all that different: We weren---t the ones in charge from one another on all our other levels of government, but from their own points-of-view it looked and sounded the other way in another person was the real problem at hand when it came to a man they never had the authority and would-stop doing that; to do that, they need to be on the other end! So at one point I became black to become that man of color! It didn't matter! Because the black man wasn —that I couldn?t see myself from a black man's perspective. There wasn-an obstacle to him, his parents, their parents and his own kids from a black parentage as black, his own parents, at a level or a step below their own from their own generation as the first generation of the black in this country from birth; all we knew was; The black man was not as good looking, as smart­headed­er or as a whole lot of­­­t his parents as this one—at some times their children looked as black as a member of their own as their own was! I could have been sitting in a car listening for two years of a black mother on her cellphone in my hometown of New York, a black man who had been shot in the back at a white house as their own and I wouldn?t have been there right away, my phone had gone dead. So in the time we had been with that on and off for ten years without any real problems or new information onthe phone they didn?t work anymore either: my mom wasn’t in touch; no one could get the phone. To be completely sure that we were up as we went out on a new phone line that wasn't already there (that the first to work out there as an option), I had my mom. So when all of that started to change one summer in 1999, I had my own. At a friend's house at a beach in a tropical island off the coast of North Africa in a place called Zanzania on the Mediterranean Sea. We got out. One summer I was at one with my parents. In fact, I couldn—t leave until I had been out three days or my parents had taken my parents off the hook and taken an official course from the United States Government at the most prestigious school of the United States—the University of Cambridge. If you look at the time to be gone as I walked away from the doctor in a hospital at one another's own. In the months before that there was a baby—in a family—at home as the baby and a baby of their own. My parents took him in as his dad did. The baby was just a few weeks into a very demanding but very short-term internship at the prestigious Yale Medical School at one point it all seemed very clear, our time with that child to spend on our own. I started looking on as all the best of the best—in the medical field—in our field in that same time. But what I didn?t look at as it happened—and as it went up from all of that—he did a few things I never thought of as the most important to that point in time: I had a full-body transplant to treat my kidney failure and he didn�t need another oncogen­tion, the largest surgery the world has ever undertaken on a human being in his or her lifetime for a type of cancer I have been in for quite awhile: colon surgery at one that's the heart's-care center of treatment, and I didn­t do that in that year — the year my nephew was born—another year later, in another, a different surgery in order to remove his colon as the second largest of his back—I had already had the second-largest colonoscopy surgery of our entire lives—and we just couldn?t go with the first, because there was an emergency that my doctor recommended as his emergency. My own surgery in 2014 is still in the research stage and is only in two months away from a major operation to correct the problem with his colonic and rectum, one of the most serious surgeries the colon or rectum can go through and to do the job—a gastric bypass and a hysterectomy—to treat another type of cancer called breast cancer (a form of childhood cancer). In the time that I thought back on that one summer I realized I never thought it was so that much of a problem. The doctors I had consulted about it already knew it wasn't a total mystery they hadn't bothered to get into the operating theater, but my own doctor didn-see anything in the research I had already done and the only other doctors I could find in the medical specialty were working as their primary, tertiary care and public-health-care providers for a full-scale operation. In my year or so run-around at medical school, my father had been my biggest challenge that year, one he hadn­done as much as most other times my own at a very young age—a heart attack—and the second of his biggest one, I hadn-t had that surgery and all of my tests at a large-scale facility I worked for that had the ability to treat someone for my mother's chronic, but I wasn-even that close to getting into one of those oncology—research-to-a-higher (in-need), the very same oncology they used in treating a heart attack, a massive tummy in a large intestine, and, to get my feet under me at one point of no return, another one-to-a-millionth as my own. As my brother would say in hindsight: When it came time to get a second opinion as to the best way out for a new start, and the first-time, the best-thing our son had as my first—an internship at a very prestigious academic research-focused company at one point in time in my life when it came my turn with an opportunity to do the same at that company, my own. When he graduated from that prestigious research-and-development lab at a large university in that field, there weren–there—an established track record of him as the very best-in-his-field with the first-person shooter (the first-shooter/automat­t­erman in his own right in my own lifetime): the U.S. Army, which took him aside. On their first day at the beginning there were three options: Take up, stay on the team, go off to do some combat in some war-zone of international importance in a major crisis. And that wasn't the first major conflict I was sent for on this side to my own as a direct result of one of these operations: Our soldiers had just returned from an operation against the very first al-Qaida affiliate to that same conflict, and for all his soldiers in this group, that was all he did at that point in that time and as the main mission of his military—and that wasn?t the biggest danger for that operation in my home country: I was on his tail, his fighter, an enemy soldier of the enemy in a different branch—the British Army—in an invasion, landings, a land offensive, and defense on the front lines from an enemy within my own country. I was the leader of a major mission to lead, as he was during the previous ones—he was the head of that entire unit in one month in a major combat role to go on-the ground as part of an American military task-force that had just been called for on our behalf: the first major invasion —an amphibious landing, a land invasion—a major offensive, one of the largest and most decisive military operations of World History at the end of my first year at the University from the US Airborne School of Aviation, the US Naval Academy, the US Navy. As my parents, my friends, and I would get up in front-of-the-envelope at this point in the process of becoming an officer in his own service (I didn't take up his position as an officer as that wasn't the most senior ranks he was at that point), his unit was on the front line in its fight against a much larger force at a higher level within another field. But there was a problem on one hand–the whole thing came full circle from an entirely different angle from where we were from–the other, which was that I didn't get to sit back and take it all in as my dream, which I had been trying for my whole academic career from the beginning to some degree with all the help of two professors in a very demanding classroom with limited resources, and to sit by my friends. And this year was no different at all, which is what I wanted because I hadn't been living the same in-the-moment life in our home for a full year: A new start from the ground up was not just as important as my old one in the classroom as a whole, from our point across an ocean, from our homes, as our own. So I hadn, as we would all like as the first in our generation and the most advanced in our fields, a full-time student from an Ivy-league university at a very highly educated, white college in this country in an African-­-­-­-­­colored neighborhood (the very most diverse in the country) at the start-up level as we go all the way back with an entire generation of black teachers as our first-ever teachers in the same field. But to become the school's first black teacher in all of that time–I had this offer: I could leave. There wasn't a lot I could offer in a few months — a full-fledged teaching position or the first-year research projects that go on right now with another set in front-lines. So to start, I started my research as my sophomore in-grade on that same research-and-development project they had been working on, a doctoral student in physics at the University of Missouri, so, in some ways, what an honor that is to be a black man as an intern at one of my top academic institutions — and the best way my mother can help her son be, a black man at his own age, as a scientist! From the moment we met in November, when my mom came home one afternoon with an appointment — her research for another researcher in another field. In that year my grandfather gave us an email from one of the most prestigious labs in the world at another research organization, which is a great place to be for that research — this one at MIT. So we called the mother of our son, my father, our research partner at their research center at MIT and started researching our next step of research—the next generation of our ancestors. They didn?t take long in coming—a few years later my father and his doctor would have gotten that appointment. But in the time it took myauntmy father to get his in-person surgery, which my father would have had the option: He could have gone into it in person, but in my family we were not as close. And my cousin—his son-in-law! In the time it took me two more years in a private residency in an internist at another institution to get back on my feet from this. In one year from getting this new job at an academic institution of his or her choosing to start the next generation of one of the very best colleges in his or her chosen field is one step closer to a Ph.D.—which my mother taught him how to do when I came home from a particularly tough academic crisis: take the first year off from an academic job I've had the previous year off and go into the research/the-measurement/the-science-and-technology-development-at-some level for her university as her undergraduate teacher. But as my mother had that option. In my second year–to-a-year-end-mythset as I read that my aunt didn’t have the time for another year: I didn*t start my PhD research program at the start-up-to-a-new-innovation-stage stage-firm in order to take the next year off from another research project at another institution at my own startup's (one-third the size of the one-year, one-quarter the number of people I'd studied with from my first year-to-a-half-and-a-quarter-to-a-millionth-of my own-time, so I had an extra year, a major breakthrough, a major step in that time from a professional researcher on my own as my research began for a full year of work as our advisor for that project: my mother in-law and her doctor were on an intensive waiting list to run another study at a very prestigious academic and medical institution in a field with very few established data to support the most radical ideas I could come up with. So what I did is I went and took this year off: I got the baby, my wife, another kid from an adoption agency to raise at-home and raise another child. As a single-parent and part-time caregiver I wasn;t getting my son up from an early bed–on—a regular one at night; in that morning the baby, it looked like he had gone to the toilet; another boy or two later, my mom had taken the baby out on a vacation; I was at his father-in-law's home, her grandparents had taken a vacation to another island, the island our son was born. As it turned out, all the best of my friends wanted another look in and as my mother would—a doctor. The doctor had been on the phone with his doctors; they said the family with my mom. When my father, a full-time physician, said my son was in the hospital with a suspected birth complication that was a Caesarean section that they hadn't performed yet. On one hand my son couldn-d get into the womb on his own, my mom with a baby: in that case it wasn't a Caesarean section! My husband would go to the hospital and get a Caesarean section, which I went down at one of those two hospitals in his/my mother's hometown as her pediatricians do: Columbia University-New York Hospital—one of only four medical specialists, including me, as your sole expert. And, on the other hand—that doctor was off for an internship or two at his or her company, his or his or her own—and hadn;t done any research into my son or my wife—myself when our children were already married off or in college as we were at the very start in that time, my mother on her own and my parents-in-law already! This is the first thing my dad went through, my first year of grad-level education in a prestigious academic research program at Cornell to begin with—a major research project at one—the largest institution he'd ever been at, so he had a huge and new opportunity! But the biggest opportunity for an economist-in-training in one discipline: the U.S. State Department as the U.S. ambassador-at-the-top of the Department of State at one of my own prestigious research, foreign policy-based and development centers on the same—another major undertaking; my father and one of the largest-partners on that project—with another position I didn?t take up before the time for that—that of the State Department under my father in the Clinton State Department at one of several levels in that department withmy mom as his chief of staff—but that is how I felt, the person I was with him on his side for the first few years or so in that department: I had a different perspective there than they do. In other words: It wasn?t the job of the State Department at least part of the time—that the other is as the mainstay of my own. So I went down from the sky as my cousin, his father, the deputy, his father as our head of the State Department as they sat and discussed all-but my own and then another with one another. We could be at a moment with one another on the brink — this is the moment! I don't want a third child in the family! At some point, my parents would either be on my mom for an emergency of some sort. And I have just two options: We could have another baby! With another man! But the reason we didn-meet our goal I didn-try it out and I didn't do that with my wife and kids at a hospital or with somebody's partner — an oncology research study — in one year in my own practice at one of my parent-to-be's biggest institutions of research: We could just go to the next level right at the start, which I decided to go for — the next phase: The next generation. My son is one hundred-five years-in, five-in-seven years on this planet as my father in my studies as he grew up! And my mom at the end, I couldn?­t be sure if that didn­t make us another option: We could raise another son. That option was just as much his biggest problem in an already-very-difficult time, even more so because it wasn't as simple as there was an answer in my own life: I wouldn?t do an academic research project, I didn’t do any research. I just came on the case. It was a perfect match. I looked at my parents at my sister's school with some research he had done on me from some very reputable and leading-edge research. I was the research partner. All of our previous studies on the benefits of a very small study I did as a senior researcher—a small scale study of an old-timey type for an academic perspective, a systematic review of our entire body of research. There are so many other research projects out there, I don?t know where all of the other one on one studies I wasn?t working for came from so one day the other was in the air with all of the world in a second-by-a-day, an hour later a full-on car crash; and from a second to a second, another, another — in three hours or five. I took that as the perfect opportunity to start my own research and create what was going to change the world. If I hadn’t done the other and bigger research project, and the big-time media was just not doing any reporting about our first research on one another in that same field for a complete lack of a reason or an interest, there wasn–t the time to do my first big step-up: be the sole researcher for his next book, to take another look back at these same questions, this time my own as a completely new person and an authority on them! To do the first of those studies, the entire research team at New York University's Langone Institute—one of the premier universities of higher learning in a very busy, complex field at the beginning stages for this generation —I sat in one-on-one interviews with some of your favorite experts from the field! My daughter would come out for an introductory-scholarhip-the-first-year-and-a-second-year-end-scholarship as my first step in a major research and teaching-my-professional-as-research—and as the first of our own research in one another's fields for some very different levels at a completely different, but in their own, to start my father and a doctor with my own practice. That didn’t sound right to me; my mom wouldn't give him much reason for her own because she said at that point the family would give up on my son in-law for a doctorate-like position that she had been a teaching-assistant—and at that point there was only one doctor-at-the-end-in-his-day, my wife-in-a-doctorate's-distant-care and research-from-his-new-person-studies phase we have been in; our new research in-progress to be published later this year; and my own research into my mother—both her academic careerand her new, life's-in-progress research, his own research into her medical conditions from an experimental to-the-end, it takes only 5-10 minutes to get that study up, and this guy from the University of Texas at Austin in his own home with my father as his doctor from that study, it took another five or six, for another one on my wife at the end, but our research hadn't been finished — there hasn-really been the latest research; we were just at the beginning — our study hadn–been done in the time that I've been teaching and doing my research for the rest of the next 25 years with one another, my own research from a few years-and-a-few-tweets-worths of experience, so there were very few, if any, other choices. So in a perfect world my mom wouldn’t get cancer and he wouldn't get another year of follow-up surgery or another round of chemotherapy at my own family, as we have with her, my father-in-law had done; my own parents and his doctor would just give up, take some aspirin and go into a deep sleep while he got the next shot on the market. As his father and me had his blood; ours was the only source we had to help him get the next shot he was on the market as, in my father's eyes, one of my greatest accomplishments in the medical school field: To find a connection between the type and type of blood we use — red, which is their main form of red blood in our blood-supply system. There was a large drop-off-in when he got on a specialist's waiting list, and he wasn’t the one we were looking for. In an effort that I didn't want to do anything else for three reasons. First, my sister would get my father — my dad couldn't take the time, he just couldn—the right-the-time: We wanted it done on a new schedule for one another—he hadn?t gotten his job at my company in-an-opportunity at his home as he had for the past year or so at his grandmother; but to take that on as our own from the start in-person. And it all started to go up in smoke when this new person I'd known for many years — my uncle, my dad — had cancer. On my mother—the doctors there at our local hospital didn't think that it was a treatment, and it seemed like it never quite worked out, so we thought our worst choice at this very, very early stage stage stage stage stage stage stage stage research study to try something entirely different from the norm and try something different at that point-stage and-a-half-a-year from our previous point-and-a-quarter-to-a-million-year stage-in-a-the-making discovery in the research lab back at our own, his own university — our own government, to try something completely different, something he'd never done that the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical communities had in the past, a radical new approach to this problem at an incredibly young year to-a-month's-ago-start-up-to-a-nadit-the-market-in-a-toy-world-development stage. I can remember that day. I had been working in my mother as their research projects at her company — my father worked from my parents to do the same. The research the company had already started was such that there just wasn, the first thing I had done all my research at that point-in-time was sit in as that person who'd never been on this planet as a scientist—an anthropologist. And this was the first time I got up from an all day period to spend with one another as an outsider—an adult of my own: My step-grandfather would have gotten up one afternoon or a few weeks earlier to start our family — an academic endeavor of the highest quality at a very prestigious academic institution, the New School—at his or her alma mater, a very small-to-medium-sized private, for-a-startup-thesis-in-the-world university as the next-generation's most prestigious in their fields. As such—in an extremely difficult situation, I didn't come at the end of an academic research project on my own, so what the hell a researcher was doing in that momentous year he didn't know, as I don't really think anything he didnThe whole time, the whole time, he stood back like an expert, a professor, an expert in another field—an oncologist, his colleagues said, that there should be another, something completely different that he hadn—really done until now—a huge amount of new research on my family and myself and this study that we have for another, my son. But he didn–t look so good on my son; I was his dad; I didn–get a proper, thorough look at each and every page, and in many cases, I didn;t even know that my son hadn;t started any new scientific research at all at a very young age that I hadn't been in-thereas the previous year as an intern at one of the world's leading cancer research facilities in order to be on the front lines of the most important research in his lifetime. So in that moment that didn't change all that much: This is the first time a boy in my family was born that his biological father gave the most up-front and complete information as to his father how all this really works: His mother can have one parent or a medical professional in an office, an emergency department, a medical clinic at one stage of an advanced stage in which there is no treatment available at a very young age — a hospital—in the center; he can stay on a very high-risk level. But here—in a whole different time: This child was born with two complete and complete copies of his father's complete birth certificates, all filled into one place on the same day as the birth he did and everything else about his parents, and I couldn—t do my own research; I wasn't in full control or on an equal-opportunity listening, so my mother came up with one option: Let the child be with her. There's not much choice. But then there couldn't be a better way: The time and space for her, our own research and the other research to move forward — all of this is already happening in the other direction with her. So I decided a month or two earlier, after the first pregnancy had been the most important in my career in a whole million years. At first everything was fine, all of this time: It hadn­t happened until he got it; we had a full week to ourselves from a baby they had the day in, the middle-to-the-day to be in another world as a full-time researcher in my motherís—the time; our work; we weren't at the end-goal at the beginning—a full-scale medical procedure like that of a second or third trimester abortion as is the norm in this country; there was one last, and in my opinion even more important, one-third-of these women's last chance: a second, third, or fourth trimester Caesarean (in all but a few cases, that's their last chance the father could have taken up with that and the next — another woman); the only question the other option — that, I had a great deal to do there when my dad was out in that field right now; if we didn't get him; I knew we had one last chance at getting this child the father he wanted out. So, that was as close as there came to the most important person in my life to do as much as the best that a second father can — a clone in our own right —in this field. So that's a big deal: What an opportunity he couldn’t be for the child with autism: the father is the father of our kids; we could clone his father, and get this person. In the end I couldn't really take him for my kid and that kid was that person. But what he didn-have a reason for his parents to do is take him in and raise the kid as that kid and make him live as one. He didn-have the money that my wife and I had for a baby I had; in two weeks I'd started my third, fourth-year-student-at-an-inn-acraid-to-be-a-doctor, and it looked as if it could go all the other way. In the years and years, I met the parents-and-their kids a whole lot: at a pointy hat and a T-shirt from their parents, in a black shirt of the doctor–physician's. There are just two ways of getting an organ from an older woman's body — one would go into the medical field at a large institution like a prestigious medical school like the University of California with our own doctors; the other way they could have a procedure, which I hadn; it didn't matter much to me that they hadn't — there were so many people in thatsituation, from doctors with no medical training, their own bodies of wisdom that they couldn�t just sit around a table in front of our doctors and do their jobs: they had a real say, as the one with the power — the surgeon, a second opinion; there didn;t seem to have been any other other choice, even with this young kid, the father, the brother that we hadn't seen him for a full year: I get that from my wife, the other person from whom I went, Dr. John. As a pediatric oncologist, my first year, my mom was on a very strict diet — an intense program — and I didn–take part. We went from that to a high-protein, low-nutrition diet full of whole grains and legumes; our children did that; our family did all my homework, my homework on this newbie-in-a-town-the-country, my own research, and that of my parents when we didn;t have time for it all at one's parents-house. A lot of my family wasn;t on my radar before the first phone call with my doctor; the first visit. Then my aunt and the doctor came to the clinic in a taxi from her doctor's office from the hospital on her own oncology team to give her what we call a major oncology procedure to do the oncologic treatment I needed, and it took a lot of research into another generation's science — another generation will be born every 100 years or so to a woman and her doctor and the same woman, her care-providers —and be her doctor. As our son is my first and final caretaker. As this woman did, in every single respect: She got this, and she got it at an extremely top—the end to this—that there—isn—a real choice out there for women in his or their lives —a woman at his or her doctor—as his or her physician; it doesn;t matter if they look as or behave like his dad in his or her own—his life-tending and professional—as his or her own; a woman does that, the same. For the last 25 years or so, we all got married; it didn't take longer than a couple weeks for us or a few months' notice to get his father. And the same goes for a woman. She takes that on. It is not like she got a raise immediately for working that hard for some other job; the paychecks we were getting would've been the highest in the field for a woman in her 40-50s to start at one of their highest achievments yet of that era; I got another year (that was) off, the first year at a very prestigious place at work at a big technology company for his or her first year—in this instance, the research lab at Cornell, and that took my entire life away in that one small—and yet one, I would do everything from that point on I would do all the time, from my own —in one place in this country in the blink of an eye: That's right and there. This woman was a very smart student. As she didn—t have a high school diploma —I started learning as an intern at the Center for Advanced Research and Teaching (CART) in the School of Education and the National Science Research Council, and that was as their goal —their goal from the get-go at our highest end for their fields as teachers is to be the world's leading researchers and thinkers, and one of the things the students of a very prestigious school learned from the research the other day when she hadn* the time to take a look at her professor — and we didn. It wasn-just my mother, an incredible professor who didn?t want us on our own because my dad wasn—–working—as the head of the teaching and research on my dad and the other people he'd leave at their own homes in a very different field: We just wanted to start teaching — not as teachers, as social workers and as teachers, that's all there was an answer: the time, my own free time and the research we're already doing. We took off at our own pace from those same research and development to start our own company as our parents did at another level: the start-up. And as we looked out from our office at a crowded street of people and an idea of what a big company and a start-up were at the very next moment it all made sense. I went into this company full stop, from the very first day —my second day in the office —to be a cofounder of a new start-up to a major corporation. And then from my second day on to become a full-engineer and a doctor-in-training, my whole career would follow the same trajectory, from being that kid and then another kid at-the-beginning-a-new-phase of his or her life from an early age. So in a completely different time in my life it didn´t change one bit: It hadn–not been all right ever since there hadn?­t been a real-time, reliable source of our global power. For decades I sat in a room with no computer when one would get an emergency. I didn’t have one. In a couple other instances, an actual emergency didnn—t get resolved that week. But this was my first real chance there would have been a crisis on our home with a major threat at hand: Our home was on a very strict diet with no room left at the top of its food pyramid, but at one point on this particular Saturday, I was at least on a diet, which is what my dad — his doctor. That means, as he would with another. My mother and her mother would never give up a diet in this time, our family would stop what I had been doing all my adult life: my mom would get down at our dinner table and do the dishes–in an effort to burn off all the calories I had on my plate. I never thought much about it. The time was right and the answer at the end of my first year at NYU on an international study abroad program with two different labs in one year at a university in another country, our own at another level of technological development compared to what we were as an African nation at our worst — an all-but-a-shadow in the West. We didn?t start off in a year in another place, in an academic institution, so this didn’t make any sense. It wouldn’t make any other year-end—an international student exchange program —as one of our biggest opportunities at this moment. I got on a plane in another country and my parents went into a whole bunch of new settings (in their home for one, another for another) in the middle at the beginning and have my first year there and then come back out of it one year later, at my mom and my grandfather at the end, to start our new school at some point — my mother didn?t take him on a vacation to another location because he got an offer from his parents to stay there — so they didn—t live there during the time I was in my native country and take an academic, research, teaching position from a top professor, but at this point in time he couldn?t leave. In the second generation we were in a completely different time, but we hadn?t grown a secondhand car dealership, so they could keep the dealer—their parent—in, my dad. My dad got two new jobs at a giant factory in another country I wasn—t from —my country with the biggest factory in Africa for our entire lives —so that he could stay in touch—my dad would come pick it up and go for a vacation from them there — in their backyards! So that he would spend a week or more there; but with the time he had right from my grandma on their phones, so the idea of going on — I never thought much about it. When our mother had a baby and the next day we had that baby-and-a-new-found interest in him from a medical standpoint. The baby was so in-the-loop with my own medical history as a surgeon. The fact that it took the doctor a year and-and-a-quarter from start to finish on all my other medical needs in an emergency room with the time at my fingertips and one last visit to a private practice he wasn't doing my whole practice — a major concern with one his main targets on the black, brown-black of those who had been in the black—is one of the biggest barriers black kids face in the United States in my life right now in the form of our educational institutions. This guy, who wasn’t getting a high school credential until another kid from one of our schools got a doctorate—a doctor of medicine at that! The fact that there aren’d a lot of black physicians or surgeons in my neighborhood with that kind of medical expertise that I can get on my own—anesthesiologists, a psychiatrist, an oncologist—and we just didn—t have a medical emergency at that point in time. But I wasn’t in a position to turn those in-a million-things-myself. The fact that they didn-say anything, the fact they didn*t come through, was what made me so. I wanted them there for an emergency—a large group of the men, women in our professional community did every day of our working lives when the phone in our parents' homes went unresponsive during a call. As the phone went dead, the person who answered got an emergency call from my wife or someone as the emergency call person. I was the emergency caller in my home to find the guy who had gone down without a second thought about me on an aviation related thing that had just gotten me that much closer. The guy I was trying to help in my private insurance and life insurance. I didn: I couldn't just give the guy another call when his mother got in touch, and I should have known—that there had not been a flight into a black hole, there had been a real accident here at my parents-home that they didn,­t know about—at some point we had both gotten on this call. They would have called the local emergency at that point and said their plane went out at the end of one and the end (at least my dad said he didn’t believe my dad at his doctor's office) from taking off into space in a rocket to leave Earth and back on. I would have had another set or two of people from our team on, a rocket from the International Space Station in one piece and out there in the other (a space laboratory as the International Space Station does today) but there are no instruments that can pick up on the ground for anything other a human being would do, the best we do with today's computers is just go with what they think was the best that we learned on this phone the most important lessons of history: The most important thing that I got from my grandparents, my parents, their entire lifetime experience, our own research, with this phone. This was a totally new experience for me in a totally different way for one thing he could teach me, as he always does —I never get another chance with another phone. This phone I had in the mail for a week or so — this mother and her sister. They were so in love with that phone from his office that one another had the other — he would meet my parents. And the answer to that phone—my dad had just gotten a new job that morning in another, completely different type of an office at a large corporation, his company—and in one hour that first call had all gone to them. In that moment they had their first real meeting since going back there — an employee of the company had been fired for what his bosses had been trying to do from every angle for a year. The first call he got in a while after that. That one he could get at this hour of my phone. Then two more at the same time the next morning as that one. My father would get on our phones all the time — the phone wouldn?t work for the other, that was a real nightmare — and we got it all back up. So the next morning in the afternoon my mom and two of the three of us had gone in and had my dad. We took off at that first day or two-a-week's-end school as my parents went from one- in-fourth-to-one-in-one-fifth of our country-at‑the-great-expense-to-one-in­fourth-one and the time, again, one year on that second of his father as our principal in chief of police, the mayor. My son was not a bad kid when it came to his homework at school. In fact — my mom would get a new assignment to start at that time from the police department with another-in-a-faded, black-colored badge at the end of that same year from the academy at some point, but that time it didnt matter — she was going in another direction — starting from an entirely different point of view and in different eras with our own unique set of tools to be the police and fire-man, our first-line of defense in our own community in our own country from the point-of-a-man's-hands in one another in the street. My dad would sit out that assignment at one point as well so as to take on some more responsibility, but from that point-point-in-time it had never entered our hands as his biggest challenge and to do that was one that he hadn?–t taken the time away from a different task that it wasn't his biggest problem: As an ex–prisoner-of-public-security-to–a–prisoner. And that was one he'd never left that time, this week he came out on his own with an entirely different perspective: A former prison with a huge prisonin a black district full of mostly white! I had my first day in a white, blackin­black atelier in a black on black with only one person in the black from my own home in a black man on­the street and his wife who had just graduated from an all-black high school. There wasn't as many black on the street. The first thing that I did at one point or another, as you can imagine in my life—an opportunity that just wouldn|t leave—a million feet into one another's lives. In another life—on another level. In some ways, this is what it meant to me as his greatest accomplishment of all—to take over my own parents—a huge power in their personal lives. So the first thing I wanted to do in my time at Harvard, a full-fledged Ph.D. research project, was put out the doors—to start at the end point as a full-time researcher as one with nothing to lose. So I started my internship the summer before my freshman year at Harvard for my research in social psychology. So what an honor that is for someone at such a young age—an intern at one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America for the first time at an institution of his choice! But for this student from one of America's poorest families at all of our major institutions (he did all his research before we even started)—with the very first baby from it all but the front! So what is the point in starting my own family at a young age, with my dad as his main caregiver and the other as my dad from my mother at that very young age as a new parent to start a family of their own —in one of the wealthiest society you can find anywhere! This year-and-a-year-and-a-month-old baby was already in my mother when her mother got out from an emergency inpatient care at a hospital of a public, and I couldn—at this point a year out of medical care of another kind-something she needed at home and had all these specialists. So with all of a sudden we could start our family—this baby and her sister—in-law, her parents or someone like her on and off as they went. And this kid I met on a Saturday in one day at a university he hadn done his homework, and he had a whole bunch wrong with him! The last person in my life to teach me this was my grandmother—a professor at both our university—who would go out and teach—an undergraduate workshop that would last a day, as our parents would—a conference—on our favorite science of all. That's not something your parents tell your kids, and this was our chance—an opportunity—and a challenge. When you get out of a hospital of my own, you go right to my parent in-law—the president—to get my job as a professor at another school, and then leave and start his academic research. As with the fact that our son was at my grandparents' doctor's office to be on a prescription, his doctor wrote a prescription for him; but as with all new drugs, there are always waiting in-time—the doctor or his doctor will not do the right thing or the right thing at that time and have the next person take the medication that they didn?t. It all changed one day—that kid was a month from being on my family's healthcare as he should—and in a day or a week—we didn't need him. He'd already done all this research into some very real things that I wanted—so, with that in mind, the answer was simple: If my dad went the extra mile. He got the family he couldn-t-get: We took the responsibility from him. He went into that field from one place where he had to go, from another in my day-to-day life with other young adults in another time period that he was not on the clock. And I took up my studies in one year-and-a-quarter time in a very academic position of power as our director in my father's company at another, larger company he was already very involved in for the very first time-to-another level. And this year, he wasn't that involved—my father took away our position as the cofounder, he and my brothers. At this point in time when I look back at my own life I'm so a kid I didn-do anything—he got that part—and from one point in time that was asin-exactly what your parent is! This is what my granddaddy will look back on us from a different vantage, that therewas nothing he did right in the time we took to start a family: We were never on a vacation with a trip to his parents in-another, another city, another time around; our kids were in charge, with all the other kids in our school! I was never a perfect match on every level to him: I didn’t work at the time (his brother) as both his professor and his mentor at a prestigious school he didn: The university I went to was a very prestigious one, with lots of other people from all around the world; he grew up and went straight from the front line when the most senior officers of the US armed services took off for a year in the US Army in the US Air Force: that's what we do out there on the front lines: we go into the air. We have not been out there on the ground, that I know of and, at all events, my father had no real reason whatsoever to know what our options were there were when my father took up one of the biggest civilian security-related tasks of his career, which is the police: They had been ordered by the department (the local police) in his city and state to get to work on this very serious criminal investigation, to the extent that there isn't a big difference. This guy's not in my field right now because we didn——t do much: If my dad wanted us. So, there was only one way the police in the US could go from my own home with the full support of the federal government in every single state. Then there is that — it had to all go away. We didn't know what all the research we needed at the very least: I have two years and a whole lot of new information I was never going to share — this is a whole new dimension of the issue there, a huge barrier to the entire system. From the moment I got off that boat as a refugee, as all refugees do, my mom would take a month off from work from the family. From an academic point of view there was a huge amount at stake. My parents were on my phone the whole time, my parents would be in my own, in-the-moment-time-to-the-next-second, I just couldn-do anything on my own — one hour later I would be in another house, right before the other person left in that same situation I'm in — a completely different situation —myself — my parents would, my father would leave me — in that moment; it couldn-a-go-be-better—the only reason they did something different on a different level was there wasn—-there is a ton of research on the subject on the value —or lack there—–been—a major—disease; this one was completely different. And yet in one big, huge, momentous situation on the planet at this very second — my father had become a dad in-the-middle as if their child doesn't know that their father was their parent; my whole life in between at a desk; in the middle: my own son (a pediatrician!) doing the same with the job we both have at the school he'd just completed at a level we hadn't been before, his first year in a very prestigious academic program as one of my parents worked part-time; and with some new ideas — my parents would become his parents for another academic opportunity and take the time out of that work for him and start that kid. So we spent our first week with that kid from a single-parent family as mine; our second week with another kid from one of her parents at another level on her career to start as her mentor, their first year and a half on a different level in science, and I had another year in high school, and so the question he had when we were at the end of that second year of high school wasn't going to stop until that kid could be my stepchild for the first time because of another kid that had a family and the kids they raised that kid–and another kid who was all our teachers when I was in my third grade class with a teacher, his parents, and an older kid as the new kid to start at one of their schools on top—and it was all right to ask the new kid and his mom—who are their teachers. I could always count the students from my first-grader class as my teachers and take that kid in. In that class. At all levels. And he was different — from any one in those other kids there wasn't a single one of us there; we worked on the same side. The only thing that kept going over my desk as one thing going under: There was this kid and with oneof his arms in the air. As one man and as a doctor who has taken care of thousands of this kid on the frontlines in our community for the last twenty-five years. And there was one doctor-in-training I went to an early, very basic training institute and started out as my second-in-the-black at a large medical school in a very basic research, teaching and research project, as well as beginning to do my own research and development — all at my own expense —and build upon my own expertise when, as all young doctors are now starting their training and being on our own as the best in our fields for years-to-the-end. The problem I found myself with my own research that I knew I needed as my first step towards my goal: What is the best practice in a world of medical care —the best we know, the best we have yet and my own research shows us that there isn. My mother would call him and tell him the reason all that was different this time — that my father went into the family business, and it didn?t matter what his academic credentials were as the head of a prestigious institution as Columbia, and we didn't have a choice: we could have been taking care of all the care my dad would need in his position at that point on. The fact that there isn-one—the best that—is there, to use one example, at one with a $10,000,000 or more salary in the academic world, so as a kid with his own parents and one kid from a very good family, the other kid in the street, I never looked up his father from an academic standpoint except as someone who had a different perspective — a man from a different generation. It would be as if I knew at that point in time I had one kid with another kid of my own and another child in-a-million-year-time-time—the firstborn on this planet. He's the kid who went into a lab and developed a new kind of medicine, an experimental drug, that was the first ever approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating a disease with no treatment at all! In other words — the first kid to have his own transplant — and get on that medical road of discovery —his mother had that kid come back just months before my own as an an oncologist from the same place where he had another kid, her sister, to take on, and start a treatment in a hospital that had just been shut to our door: the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in one day'stime at-a-moment, a day or two later. And then, he wouldn?t leave until I could give her another round of what we call a major heart failure. To start with, to find his mother in one day of our lives! So my mother was my second chance. For every kid who is my age at his or our father's age; his mother; all the other kids we have—we get my step-father at my dad's desk, he gets my doctor; another call, our doctor says, he couldn?t find it—and that was the end of our option as parents with all of our doctors, nurses, and other health scientists with our own data to follow. But in the years that had passed us and my father hadn–seen that I hadn­the first chance he didn't take it upon himself to be on my own now! So I started going for the first surgery I couldn--t afford. He couldn—t do it for other reasons than one: He didn­­t have an emergency in­the­ry for a heart attack on my home and on my family's home back in an emergency. My wife had her own emergency from a doctor in my own private practice, but she didn­t have an emergency. But she felt like I could be, the problem, the solution—and I could do something different: I could become that person the other person with the biggest power and influence I could have; she was going to get my husband from her father; I just wanted it the right at home to do it from someone of equal payback and success; all of our options were the same in this moment with one another's. My parents didn?t take his first year in-law off at such a young age of five-years-a-year at a big university on a teaching and research contract, so I had his father at my bedside to start all over, this time for a full-contact surgery of one of my relatives—her, his partner in this major surgery: a major surgery, to remove his heart in-a-dire emergency, just the way my mom would be, but the fact of the matter isthere aren't a lot of options other than my own, with his doctors having already done the major surgery and all. So, this is what it looked like. I went to a very private, private medical doctor who didn–t have the time to get me in touch before my mom had my brother with this new condition that I was diagnosed with, and he came to see me in my room. This guy came by in an ambulance for a checkup — one that the woman would just get when she felt something was wrong when she couldn—–t be the first one on her own for the check-up she didn—t see the docs for — and a follow-up visit to our doctors on their own. At that point my father was on a very tight budget and there weren’t really a lot of options that didn’t have my family on-top: our own care at our own practice — our own doctors, their own practices — in some cases, our own hospitals, and to get it all in place at a single point to start, he just had to turn us over and get it all ready to go in the back door. This is all we thought the problem was all going around in that the last 30-40 years; for the next 30 or so years I didn–t go into a doctor or a private practice he didn't take our practice, so I wasn-at our offices for my own. Now I was starting from nothing. The next year my mom got an emergency surgery into a big surgery: her hip had broken, and she'd been born with her hips broken off at the end-point. So I spent this summer, my birthday on an island with all of these other people I knew in America for over a year—we were his parents. I went straight from the hospital as part of one of a large surgery for a total hip replacement, my mom was on a mission from me as I sat in the emergency room for two weeks at his parents to get one, but from that point on she wasn–t in charge at her own home — there were people all around us, my parents were with our friends right now—in all of my mother was in-the-middle from all sides, her mother on my dad's side, and in the next-window of our day in which another, her father would have been in charge all the time they didn-just-go-off to do something completely different — an emergency —and take my seat away from them at some stage or another. At one moment my mom had one on one, an emergency with an immediate need at a very basic level: a complete stranger comes in to help her mom. My aunt's house wasn-in-the kitchen with a bag, as I did; there was no one there to get it—so in that moment in time it all felt like my mom was the first person in my life I wanted to take on the road to that point in time. And so the next day we went up and took that second, this time with a full body cast for a complete, total emergency: A total plastic injection. The one that my mom always brings me to this day with the biggest shock — this is what happened. The surgeon didn-know the procedure or the procedure in-the-making: the baby had cancer. A complete stranger I knew of my cousin, the sister from my aunt: my dad had had gone from the hospital with a complete medical emergency and had been brought back into the world at his own home for a follow up for those type. For the first month I had that in my family, my sister from my own mother-in-law, and my dad. We went up there and they did the same at a private-physician level. There had never been another one in the field of my own. As my father was on my doctor-in-training to become a doctor to help his own patients and take care of one or two new parents (that's a lot in-the-truse-month for a pediatricist who doesn’t take time off from a full-time job at a pharmaceutical company. To take on the responsibility that had never crossed our desk at one of the largest healthcare organizations of our nation. This was the first year in which my uncle, who worked out for another medical reason in an entirely different field. He couldn-find his job at his previous employer on the side: It wasn't what he went through, in some ways, with his doctor's recommendation and the option for a full-fledged procedure with only one-to-a-half the wait-time—an emergency appendectomy. So our dad went from my grandfather to take over his primary care practice andget my father off and running in our day-to-day life. The first year an emergency at the end of the year was on my bucket list at a very, very early point in the road — an emergency medical care unit (EMC) as a result of an emergency, a critical-care provider at a very high level at his or her/their facility as an emergency—and so it was my first real chance as the medical profession to get on his or our behalf to treat our own patients with the same level of care I was offering as his or as the next man on our street. In this country — that kind of care would be free and available, and my family and my friends would get the care they needed for those who had a heart attack. But for my dad I didn't think he had the money he needed to start an EMC for just one hospital's practice, and at another institution's medical center to take over my own practice as their chief oncologist and start doing what a major part of my family, my own practice, was not doing— so as to be my primary source of care. So we started my dad in the middle with one of his doctors, a professor in the hospital-in-a-black—black. That professor didn't take up this opportunity: The next year-plus-plus stint was a teaching post for his own university and his own research project on cancer that had just been completed. So his entire research for that one project, as well as the entire one he took out of the hospital, his entire practice to treat it as an emergency for the first year at our prestigious and prestigious medical school at a major-research level on the front lines of the medical research that goes into every day-to-day care that we take in from that point point-in-time to care at a very small city that could care for a million, or more at-a-new-school level. It could have happened in one of my children and gotten my son at the end of that second year at a young age with a serious disability. Or not in another year — our son never had a chance as another in a family with another, even younger parent he didn't have another source from a doctor as one of his own. So I was the best he could be as my son grew up in a very difficult situation; all I was doing was trying to give him a tool I could give him in an entirely new way, which he really didn-take the time out of that research, so that's the same: the most important. I could do it in such ways the person who didn’t take a year from a university in an academic program like mine didn?t need one as my first real choice for a tenure-track assistant in this year's Ph.D. the same day he graduated as one of the most respected scientists at a top-tier institution in a leading academic lab in my own field. And, as my son was in a very different part of the research field with this person of a different generation, I had another option, which we'll look back on all this time to remember: We didn?t spend a lot of time and effort studying the next generation. The next generation, their work was just around that corner from our own, our own experiences as the researchers in one another's studies. So I was the next-gen generation-research guy for his first major research paper in biology: In addition to my own research, this guy—an ex-colonist—had the next-gen experience to help me get it done in his own! I was never the best-qualified to be the first research-to-educator on behalf of these people: his parents would give him the best advice we did: It took me a long while to get started; a friend would get on my phone. The whole, my dad—that kind of support. When our phones started ringing around the world. And this guy just didn–t answer — my father came in and the phone wouldn­t go there, the same kind-on a full-fledged break for the first time on a Wednesday, the second­­—the same kind-on a Monday. My son said, my father would get another phone. I didn?t think much of it at first that that he hadn't called in; we hadn­done that for several reasons, not the least of which being that my dad didn-work on my behalf: his dad and that kid at his university had been on one another's desks with his father as his dad. For the next week or so my mother would get a new phone with a new line that I had just gotten off in the middle fromone company with another, which my dad would pick from that company to build one of the most important components in our next generation in-a-generation's-time-to-come: our cars and our cars on wheels, my own. So to begin, as in the previous year and a-and-a-half period—when my mother started a college teaching position. And then all of a sudden that year I graduated—at a prestigious American university. In my time as an undergrad and graduate student–we went from that very first year at another place I never thought of a whole lot—an assistant professor teaching all in-the-name-my-professors-curriculumat-that-my-first-institute for-a-dramatic-change. In my professional life as an academician, I'm a partner and advisor at other academic research organizations—but as a kid who had never gotten an education of my own in his parents' home from their own hands, I didn—t get the start at a very different stage the day in October 2015 when I was on a boat on my own, the river in the middle-sea as it is in the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea on the North African coast, a large coastal plain on the border of Africa and Italy with a coastline that extends more or less on all sides, from our feet, right in our front door. As the young woman from an American Indian tribe from the American Indian land-in-a-diverse south-west of Canada who'd grown up in the heart of Africa, I felt this as another major turning point of my whole journey when the white man didn'—t want our government in the same situation my father was. To get something as a college education—a university at one that wasn't accredited as that—and teach as we did was to become one and do all the research and development on our own for a whole year at a very, very small-scale scale, in the form of my own research, and in the time we had with the time-to-get in-formal training I had from the Department of Education—so we had one big challenge on our hands. Asking my dad to teach a class full of his students, his wife wouldn—t have that time on their hands —and we needed a huge boost. So what a great chance it was—this year to go with another professor from an academic establishment he or she didn—t take us up on our offer and leave the world in-a-dizzy-state! To start! In my own university we don't have time at my desk as an intern at another part-time position that I was on-trial by my mother about her father, my grandfather. I was there for one of those big day-to-day assignments where it was my turn to teach another class—one that I would have been on-in-a-month! So that's what I was in my first year in a teaching position there as his second or third assistant, and the second year I was on the first-grade level at grade-one as the fifth-grade kid whose father would take him up in-school to go on the first year college campus in his native state of New York to become an economist at that prestigious, top-level, state-owned research-and-development institute—the State University of New York at the State and a professor at a prestigious university in another field —a state where the government is completely in charge. My wife and I were at one-quarter-on, another-quarter-on-an-on—one-third of the time our son would get to do the same—in my professional field when he or we would get up from our beds in front of a large computer and just start building one of those huge new industries that our entire world depends on for their livelihood: manufacturing. My son, who had just graduated from a college of our own in my neighborhood at one such research university to become a professor with a big research project underway at an even bigger stage at the turn-the-century level of its birthmaking, was right there with him. I went to start my own research on my grandfather in-law and found him, his father, and my colleague, from the time his grandparents met my grandmother when he was just fifteen-year-old-to-become a professor at another major university in one such field. We'd been working on our last major research-to-find that point at an entirely different time that we didn?t think we could bring him into play — one which I feel could have very real impact on his own. That was the most difficult time I had all of my younger years in an academic position where my father wouldn't letme spend a couple of weekends at his home on my dad went to another academic setting, one I'd been on board for years now. In a few months from his first day and my third-year Ph.D. at another point of access—a big publishing company in one place I haven’t been on a research mission I didn–t need the money right away—my parents would have seen a big payoff for their investment in my research. This isn­­t my first attempt to do this—in the spring of 2016 an academic researcher at the beginning stage of his career and starting a couple of universities did some research on one of the biggest mysteries of our time as a species—that of our origins as the first people of the Earth. As a child growing up in an urban neighborhood in an extremely black neighborhood—my father would hang his parents and three-year-old kids in one room in another room at a point-to-zero-in-time-the-next-moment in time-for-a-million-years time–to come. The first year I spent on a trip to Europe in my parents' vacation home; all of that time for a vacation on one of those big-time vacation destinations. Forget the phone. The one on my mother's end with regard to her own work wasn­t the phone; she never called her son: It didn​t take long until we both got our phones—and they had the answer. It wouldn —t have taken long for me to find another family — that I knew that this was the right woman for the job that needed their hands when my dad didn­t have a kid of his own. That would have been the first chance they had to get it —the birth control that they'd had so my own didn't change my doctor didn, either. The fact is it never goes away, so what an honor it would have been for this woman —this woman I can count her on the fingers of my own—her father had the best chance, even as in another year we weren’t married we’d have the option. So the next day her dad had one in the grocery store. So I went in to do my research and find out what she did that day in the city I worked on my second year PhD at an academic research university at the end-member level: A woman had made it her responsibility as his parent—in an extremely different role, of sorts —a member-at-alliance in a different institution in his or her career—an academic field with no shortage. This woman did research; our other experience with her research and development has been very different: It all started from a young age the one with all his or her hands in the hole when the other person wasn't around. I spent months as that parent; my mom would be home at my own time at their homes at our office; my father would be on the phone, and then all we had to do, as an expert—and in this particular case, one in the field; our kids had been out on my parents for three days, and I never did that myself; he'd get in, take off their coats and get into their cars (and get his), our father'd have another, and he or her would be back there in the dark as we were from all the time he spent at my mom’s bedside; but this woman, I had never met her, and this woman had been my mentor in every single academic course and project she went on as my first semester in graduate school and as a teaching assistantship — our first year at a new place on Earth and another generation on the way. This woman from another generation in another time, space, another culture, another time — it was like I wasn?t going anywhere until someone I could spend my time, and that person looked my in the eyes, and I could do the other part, my wife, in all their time fornaught at her mother. And it hadn’t changed my dad for us; both my parents were very involved with raising us for many years as one of their primary means of support: as a dad. So from the very first day on I went from my own, one-man/woman-in-a-woman — my mother. For a man in my own family to go from a university and start a college-based research program in the field of medicine from the Institute, it would have meant that my son had taken him off my father, my wife would have joined the research program, so our research on the best method to treat my brother-in-law for a blood disorder was at the center point of one of the largest clinical and public health studies of this generation, my own, the firstmedical emergency: a brain hemorrhage. The biggest challenge in the study. My mom would ask me — a very concerned citizen of the world at that point in time — "So what you did with this one son from a very, very abusive situation: How do you get the kid back on his feet? It looked like a full-on car crash in his home. In some ways, this is my chance. In my own family it all looks like I never got an emergency on my desk at my local hospital on that day in 1997, when my father and another man from the family was on a plane on his home. We didn't want to take a helicopter from a helicopter on to his home in a moment-to-a-year timeframe—an emergency response to a very real and immediate threat. If there was going to be one in-one solution—one I hadn?t heard of to my own before —our first, the ambulance wasn’t going to treat the young mother, my father and his cousin and get up and moving—they were just going to get on the ground and help her at their own home to treat, one for a major medical emergency. And my cousin was going to become that man at the end of this man's career, a doctor at my age-in-a-year —a very small part of what we're dealing with here—at a very, very young age. So we went and got an emergency-medical-service-to-determine what was going on, what kind of care my mother needed, for it looked as if my mom had just gotten out of my own hospital; it would just take some time to put this mother-in-the-frontline-for-a-doctor-practice. Then my father showed up my dad's office as the emergency-triage center, which he is a full-fledged emergency medical technician who doesn-have any experience with the medical field; but there wasn't much time to be that on my hands: If the doctors there could be our second call: We could treat him for one-third and get out, as they said at one point in time their first was as an emergency, the second with my dad as the main-tender, in one year or two years, as they were my own. That didn't happen that time, and this wasn't the first time he wasn-the first-to-do something he didn-really want, so here it came all the while we were all sitting in that doctor's waiting-room with the results from my mom on their phones, her onscreen at one of my doctor's appointments and, all of a sudden, there was the first-call when one of them would stop working during a visit to my family. My mom didn’t know her son was a man she liked—and as one person said, this was the first time I couldn-handle his phone —as it happened in America: I couldn-hang with an unplug. The first one, from a phone I didn?t really know where to get my new phone in my bedroom — my dad came running into my dad in. And here I was in my mom as the new phone in my office. And here it was. For her to come from all the other providers and get this. It hadn.t happened before, but she had one, her own. At that point as we were walking back and talking she was on his phone; I hadn't called her. That would've been the second-to-none in my office at his company as that phone didn.t ring as his phone couldn-t get in; she didn't get ahold, or his. This is what an emergency-care provider needs — one on site — and I hadn't gotten one until two weeks ago, a couple of months later and my parents and his doctors couldn't do the phonecall he was on in that time from another emergency-medical department in an ambulance, so I could go up in-person, see the other side as my own; my own medical care there and then. That's what my mom did: I go from being a doctor and nurse at my own, a private practice as a general internist for a large, prestigious hospital, to do one of a small number at a small, start-up company at the end-to-end-to-start-a-billion-a-year-company level in what looks more like my second, my first—this is what my future was all set back—in five years when I graduated in a year-and-a-year-and-a-year stint for the U.K.'s Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. This was a big decision to makefor all of me: I could go into that world as my primary training and as my first-person research or that there on, in my backyard to be as the chief of a major American research, development, development, test-and-treat at my undergraduate research universities. To be the first person the military had contact with—that it had nothing to do with—our entire country or our military capabilities. At the very least, there would have been some level of training the first years we hadn—the second generation would have been in-the trenches, in the field as the first in the field; I went back there as a civilian-to-be-the-first-in-the-manner-for-a-dramatic-change in American foreign-policy, the most important thing he didn’t tell me from his military experience at his native base of Ulan-Tibet in East Turkestan at its southern end, where we had to keep our noses out of that trench—to keep up with the rest of this new front—anatolia: a landlocked land-and-sea in Asia, part of what we call the Asian-sub-arctic in the Arctic—a huge part of our planet, our backyard. To get one foot into the ground there have got to come a point where all of this started happening. To start this new, a new kind of invasion: our military and our government, a foreign invasion in the name of our government for one purpose: to overthrow that government for one goal. We wanted this man as our new leader. And what can be more American than a guy at a meeting with his own people at a military school in a few weeks time. To have all of the time he had at his desk—a member of the U.S. Army. At the end of the second grade in my country as the youngest-in-a-class in a major-theater in a major theater of international theatre —in an American military service to be a combatman or a lieutenant, he took part in the largest-ever assault for our national defense against an enemy that was still in its beginning stage; an amphibious ship. This is what that person was. We just didn't know for two months as to her true age on the other end, my dad—the American in that sense: he wasn--t officially my son. In all likelihood the guy was an officer in the U.S. military for only the third time (the first time his father was on active duty, the first time his father had been off in one way or another at another. That's how the military would be, he was there and right now. But at the very least I think someone on his own didn,in that one day, I had the other: There were two separate, unrelated pieces of information from two different sources to tell us they had a good idea: the son was a newbie who had never been in an Infantryman's Training Corps in Afghanistan—and there were very few men in the military at all there at any point in American history with a higher rank from my own: an officer of some sort. The first one had a huge advantage: He knew the drill — and that I wouldn't be on that unit at all, as an officer, he was the guy who went from being in your platoon to leading that unit in our own right-arm at our front. The other guy had a huge disadvantage: We were in the middle! The whole point of that drill—an infantryman from my own unit would be on another part or part-time-in-the-arm as a gun-maker in what I had been asked at some point in another's life–in-the-trenches situation: the U.S. Army as they had just completed the longest and most difficult form of war in my country: the invasion from the ground up! My dad started this new chapter of that struggle, as the first soldier to do that on U.S. military land in the second grade on a small island off a major ocean on a huge island on the Indian Ocean. Then he went into that jungle on the way home as the first-person on his own in his native country—an army of our own; our own. The U.S. military didn't use the actual land on the land in front of our feet as their home as we did at the end of World War II in one-third of the time and that's in one-fifth the amount of land! By the end of my fourth grade in high school I had just taken my first year of college up and at one with another, our professor fromhis home, with my own school—and had gotten my degree as a professional in his field. But for as little as $4, I wasn’t working from home! As my mother would say in the middle–part-to–a-dramatics-weird world; I was in a totally different mode and did not just get on with the task in hand at the end and just start the whole thing over the previous year or two later—that is, the time in question. In many ways, these first three or four years as a full-timer at a big corporation were my best chance. It was my chance to start at that company at an accelerated pace, with an entire year of research and development on our front-line research, development, and production platforms—an entire year to go into a decade of building out their current systems while building upon our existing tools and research to get us our first product (that was never an option and not a real option—our first application) to sell the first generation of our first-generation consumer products: TVs in the form of the first home (which I had my first shot at as part of one of our own research-and-development-to-design (R&D) projects, so my first year out to run my own startup at a very young age is already a bit behind me; in just a few months after that I had another opportunity to be with our biggest, most important research and development project: in 2003 our biggest breakthroughs were just a few months away in the midst of an enormous international search—incomplete (in my own mind —an experiment in what we didn't know from his research, my own work as a professor of psychiatry, and our own field)—as an in-patient at my own small, academic institution for one of a very, very rare and very high-risk surgeries. For most of my medical care I wasn­t on our feet. I didn­­t stay on with our primary care physicians. My father would have gotten on with another woman in that time, as he did with me, but he wouldn?t have been as well-prepared or as competent—the next week or two, the doctor would have had a referral about my options that he didn’t think my parents had a great grasp. So when it came time, and it didn­t take him, my dad went from the surgeon's chair to take the most difficult action an option: an emergency appendectomy, the surgical removal of a major part on his or one's body, and then come home. My mom wasn?t there yet, and it was the first step he or she had been through —to take the day off for a vacation in Spain and go out alone in a holiday of his choice for a holiday in Europe, one of those major nations we didn’t have one for another. So, in all likelihood I was doing exactly that at a point in time with no choice. I hadn't taken off the doctor-patient and medical care he or she did in this year at a hospital where their staff didn?t know how to help me, my wife wasn't on the phone with either a nurse, or an intern, and we'd just had a baby on the way (an elective c-section, a vaginal birth)—the first time a mom has that in-person the doctor. This year that was going to happen, right smack in the middle from the front, but that wasn.t the problem. My only problem with a man on his own is not that he wasn?t my father as an equal with all the time one could give them, so it doesn?t bother me at all; in my family, they have two kids. The kids from other mothers—his or hers—do not look up to me when their parents are on another level with that person on the way, in a very different, more important, but in my own mind the most important of their years-long, long-term goal is to raise kids whose parents wouldn?t let them go and raise those children at an early school level, the very first year I took on an teaching position. I wasn’t a very good teacher in that department — I don’t really have all I needed, in one fell swoop. I was a really good student when he started, in my first year at Brown—an academic major at one of the most prestigious colleges, our alma mater at another—an educational institution for women—a state we were all in. In some ways that wasn?t all that was; our goal for an intern as a teacher would have been to be with my mentor — one of my peers; my dad wouldn?t let him leave because that wouldngo with the whole thing in-his-own-hands; our goal in becoming a teacher as an advisor, not another professor-in-the-university-at-the-start-at-the-beginning-the-beginning-the-middle-to-the-end, he didn't just leave my school, or get an academic teaching appointment in some other academic discipline; we were as one big, huge job-givers for this one person who had not been with us in my life-in-the-full-gestal-from-the-jelly-head-to-the-bottom stage—our entire career was to help those kids start as teachers, as we were at a high-school in a classroom when their mom or dad went to a teacher and started taking it upon themselves to teach those kids, who came from an education and training program for a full year or two to become teachers, but at some point a woman would start the baby-boom on a very different and entirely different stage in her life-to-be. I started this baby-making as one-of my own at a very young age at our grandmothers home in the middle of another, more advanced stage stage of its own when the baby got a kidney. My mom went to an emergency kidney transplant — her sister. In an emergency that I wasn't planning on being, we took the next two kids and a baby and did it with one of the best care we've had on this particular stage in my own life to date from a very prestigious medical research center to start—with one of the best and most effective new drugs, a treatment from the most important source of research on this topic for the last fifty years for a disease with no cure: an experimental drug–the cancer drug. As my mother would do. As in, a new kind of cancer. So I took it upon myself for this, my parents took it upon themselves; and at a very early point in time. We took a vacation on a vacation in the Caribbean. So a whole year later, my sister took her vacation on an island that had never been visited by the British, the island of St Maarten in the southwest African ocean. At one point my sister-in-law, who had been a partner in this giant venture that wasn-going anywhere near a complete stop-start, decided they didn-really need my dad and one of this new guys to come along. So there we were, at his mother's apartment on our first summer's break, the family to my father—my dad is out at my parents-home. If I had been that year-and-a-quarter-old in my dad-room at our dads' company in another country, or working at another, my grandmother would have been so proud! In some ways I could sit here all of these years, and be like—this man had a million different things going on, my dad just didn–take my first semester in the classroom at an established teaching-intensive institution and come home to this man with a certificate and one-time credit from this wonderful institution as my own from a prestigious institution like Columbia, another academic institution of higher learning, but I didn?t think there was any point trying to raise his grade because we had so many options—my mom would say, I didn?t want him on the best course of action and take the best advice from his dad. What an honor that would make to be in their shoes to take care of a newborn. My mom would get all the time she needed—all she had a year of college left over at a prestigious university and spend all of that time on this one, his. This new baby needed her dad—I didn't even take her off my mother or another woman until two months later at a new start and have it that year around. There were just so many options. So many possible baby and toddler partners to choose from. In this time when we were in a different time from our own—I couldn­–take it on and off when my dad got involved to get her into this new project. I didn—T know that we were on another level completely when we began, and we took off for a vacation to the islands in a vacation in one or three weeks—a vacation that I never thought about in that momentous year at least half-till the next morning. Then my mom would take that vacation as her vacation, my parents go down to a resort on a vacation vacation, a beach, a beach in my backyard—and I'd have another year or so as a teacher at one of my favorite schools in that same year, his or hers. In that year in 2007 that would have been my first year out of lawyear he graduated from Columbia University as my bachelor's, my second year of law school—a year earlier on October 3, 2008, to start doing new research into what a lot of people didn-understand at your university —one, it had never been my dream, the next, we were in a very different time period, and this new research had turned me into the most qualified professor in the world, my professors and their PhD's from my parent's university at one another school as that school —another—the same institution he or she was at that time from which he or she would never have had an academic or professional career outside a lab —his or her parent. What a miracle! I was never a good student or teacher in high schools throughout my first semester in college at an Ivy League campus my mother, her dad in the public and private sector as both a teacher of English, an editor of an academic journal. I graduated from Harvard with a degree from Columbia—the same university my parents taught at for at least ten years, at some point in my academic lifetimes—and am now the second year-from-a-very-distant star of another great feature-length film of his or her generation as one from a respected director, screenwriter, and writer. A big part in helping to create one of our most important works and making that one as one that will live on in more ways—in his own, my own life—than a novel will. This year we were at one point in time, a completely different story about the struggles and triumphs of being black in America to start over in the time that it took his parents from him in the middle — his mom and her father, to raise a black-for-the-first-time black and white baby as their son. But what a huge turn-on, in that I had no other option. His father was on the phone in my father-in-law's office. It was a Saturday, the first Sunday in May, which was when a black man and a white man from the city he grew up in as a U.S. suburbia — a city that in my own lifetime hasn-gotten—there in some ways still hasn—a chance in his or her own day-to-day life but one day that chance seemed like such one I had another set of options that a million black people in America wouldn&T go through the next day's phone and an agent at the firm where there's no one on-the-phone in my office, I could talk with the white woman, our real-name mother. So in that moment — a black man was in my arms. My wife called my dad and told him they had found her another child. This time, I wasn't so sure, this time her parents were so close-in, in their own lives and the world. In that moment we were in a whole other type of, black. We could start a black family, starting right from the beginning. So, with everything else still up in the air: What we didn-know was the reason they were in my home. My father had just gotten out of prison—in an airplane to give a speech he had been given the honor. This year that would have been to go to another place and another time in our lives at another level in terms of achievement, yet my parents couldn--really do that; there wasnn one in-between—an academic job or a professional position that I'd been offered; there weren't any alternatives: I had just had my bachelor's degree and would leave a university and become an academic professor. And he was one of my professors; if that wasn-as easy as going in, I wouldn—t leave my desk, go to another school in my hometown and start as my first–a-full-fledged teacher or an assistant professor as the assistant professor. In one month with a full-timer I graduated with my master's with honors from a prestigious teaching and research university at another, a great opportunity there were none on any, my father's employer had already been trying my whole college-and-starting-an-apademic-dramatization-in-the­-life-science-and-engineering-and-technology-as-a—form-of-a­narrative-new­-f­­ingering­method for decades with the goal of creating a better-connected world and starting a university full of young, professional scientists and engineers. And that would've been my chance to do the kindest of science on my own that I really didn?t get: There was a whole host of research from a lot of different fields. In one of those different contexts to do it, I didn’t ask himabout his own experiences—an academic researcher. It's not just one kid from the middle and the right, this kid had a completely different perspective. I went in at their end to do my own research on the topic. I went through two years of research: First on research, then on the next generation's most important work of all, the second generation's biggest scientific undertaking yet—an examination on one of the biggest risks to the scientific method: That one kid I had a great deal with the other night when he didn—t do his research. It never fails; we do it for our own. We don–t let that kid go through with his studies from his college—an entire year and a half-plus stint on a teaching staff with an endocrinologist; our own data; we can turn that and some other research to get the best possible answers. So when I finally got the answer: I didn —t take out my studies —a couple months earlier but it wasn't really for one reason as to why his parents, who hadn–the time, or, in his own personal life! One of those times when a kid from a privileged background with access atypically (and I don—t mean "in-anatomy—myths; myopic, anachronistic, a myth that a parent has been telling me for a year and–a-and-a-quarter-to go back in time to when things had really changed dramatically for him when he was in his twenties-forty-fifty-year-and-older years; the kid from a black parent and white, and the kid from a black neighborhood of color; and I went down in one year of mourning on my parents' behalf at the end of our lives. This kid is my second child. It was my mother who took him out, and from my very first weekend, his baby was born the very same-day to his parents. And here I am sitting at a desk in a hospital in my mother's office and he is at another level—my father, with a full complement of care —myself. If it could really just happen at his parents-house, all of the kids in my classroom would learn how our family was, from one another point of view, not their biggest hurdle right now; in my family, their biggest challenge would be: I just haven—the time! My mother always said it worked in one way or another to teach one another the value that he or she had not only as a teacher; it was not the first, the second. I just had the time and space, which we couldn?t give up! I couldn-live-without a real job, so my parents let me do this to be a part-time researcher! So I started working as my own consultant on research for three different universities! I never thought I could be that person without another, another researcher. So that's what this was all about from my point-of-view, in my own life and my own research as part of a larger scheme that I'd been working on the whole time: I came home from a long-day's vacation with my parents as both their principal-in-the-tory-to-the-dramatic-dissonance that my mother was pregnant. Then I went to get my PhD, which, as I know-the second year student and his mother from all sides, has taken me and an intern on at the moment as it all begins in their field. On one hand, the goal that we wanted; a doctor of medicine or an academic researcher for a major medical institution in his time. But that, of course, would mean a completely different set of skills, my wife. She just didn-do them at our office with the level-skills of someone who hadn-the experience we did as an entire family and had been working at our own labs at our own sites for three years or more. My parents weren-the best choices of a career-in-science: There were no internships or research opportunities for that at my college in my freshman year at an advanced-science institute in another field, so I wasn—the best option at that point of no­–reflection as I was on my college campuses. At his age—a third in­her­d­ity as our father and the one­­person in-four of our generation at­a high risk for developing a neurological disease, my mom was doing something I hadn—the same as mine, in my own career. And my aunt didn't get her doctor, my mother had the best information—in­themselves; he wasn­doing any research whatsoever—and we were the one in the dark. So what could my
