                  IMMORALITY ACT, 1927
  To prohibit illicit carnal intercourse between Europeans
       and natives and other acts in relation thereto.




B E IT ENACTED by the King+IBk-s Most Excellent Majesty, the Senate and the House of
Assembly of the Union of South Africa, as follows:+IBQ-
  1. Any European male who has illicit carnal intercourse with a native female, and any
native male who has illicit carnal intercourse with a European female+ICY-shall be guilty of an
offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years.

T he genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn
on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate
one another so you can run them all.
    At the time, black South Africans outnumbered white South Africans nearly five to one, yet
we were divided into different tribes with different languages: Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho,
Venda, Ndebele, Tsonga, Pedi, and more. Long before apartheid existed these tribal factions
clashed and warred with one another. Then white rule used that animosity to divide and
conquer. All nonwhites were systematically classified into various groups and subgroups.
Then these groups were given differing levels of rights and privileges in order to keep them at
odds.
     Perhaps the starkest of these divisions was between South Africa+IBk-s two dominant groups,
the Zulu and the Xhosa. The Zulu man is known as the warrior. He is proud. He puts his head
down and fights. When the colonial armies invaded, the Zulu charged into battle with nothing
but spears and shields against men with guns. The Zulu were slaughtered by the thousands,
but they never stopped fighting. The Xhosa, on the other hand, pride themselves on being the
thinkers. My mother is Xhosa. Nelson Mandela was Xhosa. The Xhosa waged a long war
against the white man as well, but after experiencing the futility of battle against a better-
armed foe, many Xhosa chiefs took a more nimble approach. +IBw-These white people are here
whether we like it or not,+IB0- they said. +IBw-Let+IBk-s see what tools they possess that can be useful to us.
Instead of being resistant to English, let+IBk-s learn English. We+IBk-ll understand what the white man
is saying, and we can force him to negotiate with us.+IB0-
    The Zulu went to war with the white man. The Xhosa played chess with the white man. For
a long time neither was particularly successful, and each blamed the other for a problem
neither had created. Bitterness festered. For decades those feelings were held in check by a
common enemy. Then apartheid fell, Mandela walked free, and black South Africa went to war
with itself.
                                                                           RUN



Sometimes in big Hollywood movies they+IBk-ll have these crazy chase scenes where
somebody jumps or gets thrown from a moving car. The person hits the ground
and rolls for a bit. Then they come to a stop and pop up and dust themselves off,
like it was no big deal. Whenever I see that I think, That+IBk-s rubbish. Getting thrown
out of a moving car hurts way worse than that.
     I was nine years old when my mother threw me out of a moving car. It
happened on a Sunday. I know it was on a Sunday because we were coming home
from church, and every Sunday in my childhood meant church. We never missed
church. My mother was+IBQ-and still is+IBQ-a deeply religious woman. Very Christian.
Like indigenous peoples around the world, black South Africans adopted the
religion of our colonizers. By +IBw-adopt+IB0- I mean it was forced on us. The white man
was quite stern with the native. +IBw-You need to pray to Jesus,+IB0- he said. +IBw-Jesus will
save you.+IB0- To which the native replied, +IBw-Well, we do need to be saved+IBQ-saved from
you, but that+IBk-s beside the point. So let+IBk-s give this Jesus thing a shot.+IB0-
     My whole family is religious, but where my mother was Team Jesus all the
way, my grandmother balanced her Christian faith with the traditional Xhosa
beliefs she+IBk-d grown up with, communicating with the spirits of our ancestors. For
a long time I didn+IBk-t understand why so many black people had abandoned their
indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I
sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you+IBk-re
Native American and you pray to the wolves, you+IBk-re a savage. If you+IBk-re African and
you pray to your ancestors, you+IBk-re a primitive. But when white people pray to a
guy who turns water into wine, well, that+IBk-s just common sense.
     My childhood involved church, or some form of church, at least four nights a
week. Tuesday night was the prayer meeting. Wednesday night was Bible study.
Thursday night was Youth church. Friday and Saturday we had off. (Time to sin+ACE-)
Then on Sunday we went to church. Three churches, to be precise. The reason we
went to three churches was because my mom said each church gave her something
different. The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord. The second church
offered deep analysis of the scripture, which my mom loved. The third church
offered passion and catharsis+ADs- it was a place where you truly felt the presence of
the Holy Spirit inside you. Completely by coincidence, as we moved back and forth
between these churches, I noticed that each one had its own distinct racial
makeup: Jubilant church was mixed church. Analytical church was white church.
And passionate, cathartic church, that was black church.
     Mixed church was Rhema Bible Church. Rhema was one of those huge,
supermodern, suburban megachurches. The pastor, Ray McCauley, was an ex-
bodybuilder with a big smile and the personality of a cheerleader. Pastor Ray had
competed in the 1974 Mr. Universe competition. He placed third. The winner that
year was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Every week, Ray would be up onstage working
really hard to make Jesus cool. There was arena-style seating and a rock band
jamming out with the latest Christian contemporary pop. Everyone sang along,
and if you didn+IBk-t know the words that was okay because they were all right up
there on the Jumbotron for you. It was Christian karaoke, basically. I always had a
blast at mixed church.
     White church was Rosebank Union in Sandton, a very white and wealthy part
of Johannesburg. I loved white church because I didn+IBk-t actually have to go to the
main service. My mom would go to that, and I would go to the youth side, to
Sunday school. In Sunday school we got to read cool stories. Noah and the flood
was obviously a favorite+ADs- I had a personal stake there. But I also loved the stories
about Moses parting the Red Sea, David slaying Goliath, Jesus whipping the
money changers in the temple.
     I grew up in a home with very little exposure to popular culture. Boyz II Men
were not allowed in my mother+IBk-s house. Songs about some guy grinding on a girl
all night long? No, no, no. That was forbidden. I+IBk-d hear the other kids at school
singing +IBw-End of the Road,+IB0- and I+IBk-d have no clue what was going on. I knew of these
Boyz II Men, but I didn+IBk-t really know who they were. The only music I knew was
from church: soaring, uplifting songs praising Jesus. It was the same with movies.
My mom didn+IBk-t want my mind polluted by movies with sex and violence. So the
Bible was my action movie. Samson was my superhero. He was my He-Man. A guy
beating a thousand people to death with the jawbone of a donkey? That+IBk-s pretty
badass. Eventually you get to Paul writing letters to the Ephesians and it loses the
plot, but the Old Testament and the Gospels? I could quote you anything from
those pages, chapter and verse. There were Bible games and quizzes every week at
white church, and I kicked everyone+IBk-s ass.
     Then there was black church. There was always some kind of black church
service going on somewhere, and we tried them all. In the township, that typically
meant an outdoor, tent-revival-style church. We usually went to my
grandmother+IBk-s church, an old-school Methodist congregation, five hundred
African grannies in blue-and-white blouses, clutching their Bibles and patiently
burning in the hot African sun. Black church was rough, I won+IBk-t lie. No air-
conditioning. No lyrics up on Jumbotrons. And it lasted forever, three or four
hours at least, which confused me because white church was only like an hour+IBQ-in
and out, thanks for coming. But at black church I would sit there for what felt like
an eternity, trying to figure out why time moved so slowly. Is it possible for time to
actually stop? If so, why does it stop at black church and not at white church? I
eventually decided black people needed more time with Jesus because we suffered
more. +IBw-I+IBk-m here to fill up on my blessings for the week,+IB0- my mother used to say.
The more time we spent at church, she reckoned, the more blessings we accrued,
like a Starbucks Rewards Card.
     Black church had one saving grace. If I could make it to the third or fourth
hour I+IBk-d get to watch the pastor cast demons out of people. People possessed by
demons would start running up and down the aisles like madmen, screaming in
tongues. The ushers would tackle them, like bouncers at a club, and hold them
down for the pastor. The pastor would grab their heads and violently shake them
back and forth, shouting, +IBw-I cast out this spirit in the name of Jesus+ACEgHQ- Some
pastors were more violent than others, but what they all had in common was that
they wouldn+IBk-t stop until the demon was gone and the congregant had gone limp
and collapsed on the stage. The person had to fall. Because if he didn+IBk-t fall that
meant the demon was powerful and the pastor needed to come at him even
harder. You could be a linebacker in the NFL. Didn+IBk-t matter. That pastor was
taking you down. Good Lord, that was fun.
     Christian karaoke, badass action stories, and violent faith healers+IBQ-man, I
loved church. The thing I didn+IBk-t love was the lengths we had to go to in order to
get to church. It was an epic slog. We lived in Eden Park, a tiny suburb way
outside Johannesburg. It took us an hour to get to white church, another forty-five
minutes to get to mixed church, and another forty-five minutes to drive out to
Soweto for black church. Then, if that wasn+IBk-t bad enough, some Sundays we+IBk-d
double back to white church for a special evening service. By the time we finally
got home at night, I+IBk-d collapse into bed.
     This particular Sunday, the Sunday I was hurled from a moving car, started
out like any other Sunday. My mother woke me up, made me porridge for
breakfast. I took my bath while she dressed my baby brother Andrew, who was
nine months old. Then we went out to the driveway, but once we were finally all
strapped in and ready to go, the car wouldn+IBk-t start. My mom had this ancient,
broken-down, bright-tangerine Volkswagen Beetle that she picked up for next to
nothing. The reason she got it for next to nothing was because it was always
breaking down. To this day I hate secondhand cars. Almost everything that+IBk-s ever
gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand car. Secondhand cars
made me get detention for being late for school. Secondhand cars left us
hitchhiking on the side of the freeway. A secondhand car was also the reason my
mom got married. If it hadn+IBk-t been for the Volkswagen that didn+IBk-t work, we never
would have looked for the mechanic who became the husband who became the
stepfather who became the man who tortured us for years and put a bullet in the
back of my mother+IBk-s head+IBQ-I+IBk-ll take the new car with the warranty every time.
    As much as I loved church, the idea of a nine-hour slog, from mixed church to
white church to black church then doubling back to white church again, was just
too much to contemplate. It was bad enough in a car, but taking public transport
would be twice as long and twice as hard. When the Volkswagen refused to start,
inside my head I was praying, Please say we+IBk-ll just stay home. Please say we+IBk-ll just
stay home. Then I glanced over to see the determined look on my mother+IBk-s face,
her jaw set, and I knew I had a long day ahead of me.
    +IBw-Come,+IB0- she said. +IBw-We+IBk-re going to catch minibuses.+IB0-
                                          +IBQ-
My mother is as stubborn as she is religious. Once her mind+IBk-s made up, that+IBk-s it.
Indeed, obstacles that would normally lead a person to change their plans, like a
car breaking down, only made her more determined to forge ahead.
     +IBw-It+IBk-s the Devil,+IB0- she said about the stalled car. +IBw-The Devil doesn+IBk-t want us to go
to church. That+IBk-s why we+IBk-ve got to catch minibuses.+IB0-
    Whenever I found myself up against my mother+IBk-s faith-based obstinacy, I
would try, as respectfully as possible, to counter with an opposing point of view.
     +IBw-Or,+IB0- I said, +IBw-the Lord knows that today we shouldn+IBk-t go to church, which is
why he made sure the car wouldn+IBk-t start, so that we stay at home as a family and
take a day of rest, because even the Lord rested.+IB0-
    +IBw-Ah, that+IBk-s the Devil talking, Trevor.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, because Jesus is in control, and if Jesus is in control and we pray to
Jesus, he would let the car start, but he hasn+IBk-t, therefore+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-No, Trevor+ACE- Sometimes Jesus puts obstacles in your way to see if you
overcome them. Like Job. This could be a test.+IB0-
    +IBw-Ah+ACE- Yes, Mom. But the test could be to see if we+IBk-re willing to accept what has
happened and stay at home and praise Jesus for his wisdom.+IB0-
    +IBw-No. That+IBk-s the Devil talking. Now go change your clothes.+IB0-
    +IBw-But, Mom+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Trevor+ACE- Sun+IBk-qhela+ACEgHQ-
    Sun+IBk-qhela is a phrase with many shades of meaning. It says +IBw-don+IBk-t undermine
me,+IB0- +IBw-don+IBk-t underestimate me,+IB0- and +IBw-just try me.+IB0- It+IBk-s a command and a threat, all
at once. It+IBk-s a common thing for Xhosa parents to say to their kids. Any time I
heard it I knew it meant the conversation was over, and if I uttered another word I
was in for a hiding+IBQ-what we call a spanking.
     At the time, I attended a private Catholic school called Maryvale College. I
was the champion of the Maryvale sports day every single year, and my mother
won the moms+IBk- trophy every single year. Why? Because she was always chasing
me to kick my ass, and I was always running not to get my ass kicked. Nobody ran
like me and my mom. She wasn+IBk-t one of those +IBw-Come over here and get your
hiding+IB0- type moms. She+IBk-d deliver it to you free of charge. She was a thrower, too.
Whatever was next to her was coming at you. If it was something breakable, I had
to catch it and put it down. If it broke, that would be my fault, too, and the ass-
kicking would be that much worse. If she threw a vase at me, I+IBk-d have to catch it,
put it down, and then run. In a split second, I+IBk-d have to think, Is it valuable? Yes.
Is it breakable? Yes. Catch it, put it down, now run.
      We had a very Tom and Jerry relationship, me and my mom. She was the
strict disciplinarian+ADs- I was naughty as shit. She would send me out to buy
groceries, and I wouldn+IBk-t come right home because I+IBk-d be using the change from
the milk and bread to play arcade games at the supermarket. I loved videogames. I
was a master at Street Fighter. I could go forever on a single play. I+IBk-d drop a coin
in, time would fly, and the next thing I knew there+IBk-d be a woman behind me with a
belt. It was a race. I+IBk-d take off out the door and through the dusty streets of Eden
Park, clambering over walls, ducking through backyards. It was a normal thing in
our neighborhood. Everybody knew: That Trevor child would come through like a
bat out of hell, and his mom would be right there behind him. She could go at a
full sprint in high heels, but if she really wanted to come after me she had this
thing where she+IBk-d kick her shoes off while still going at top speed. She+IBk-d do this
weird move with her ankles and the heels would go flying and she wouldn+IBk-t even
miss a step. That+IBk-s when I knew, Okay, she+IBk-s in turbo mode now.
     When I was little she always caught me, but as I got older I got faster, and
when speed failed her she+IBk-d use her wits. If I was about to get away she+IBk-d yell,
+IBw-Stop+ACE- Thief+ACEgHQ- She+IBk-d do this to her own child. In South Africa, nobody gets involved
in other people+IBk-s business+IBQ-unless it+IBk-s mob justice, and then everybody wants in.
So she+IBk-d yell +IBw-Thief+ACEgHQ- knowing it would bring the whole neighborhood out against
me, and then I+IBk-d have strangers trying to grab me and tackle me, and I+IBk-d have to
duck and dive and dodge them as well, all the while screaming, +IBw-I+IBk-m not a thief+ACE-
I+IBk-m her son+ACEgHQ-
    The last thing I wanted to do that Sunday morning was climb into some
crowded minibus, but the second I heard my mom say sun+IBk-qhela I knew my fate
was sealed. She gathered up Andrew and we climbed out of the Volkswagen and
went out to try to catch a ride.
                                          +IBQ-
I was five years old, nearly six, when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. I
remember seeing it on TV and everyone being happy. I didn+IBk-t know why we were
happy, just that we were. I was aware of the fact that there was a thing called
apartheid and it was ending and that was a big deal, but I didn+IBk-t understand the
intricacies of it.
     What I do remember, what I will never forget, is the violence that followed.
The triumph of democracy over apartheid is sometimes called the Bloodless
Revolution. It is called that because very little white blood was spilled. Black blood
ran in the streets.
     As the apartheid regime fell, we knew that the black man was now going to
rule. The question was, which black man? Spates of violence broke out between
the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC, the African National Congress, as they
jockeyed for power. The political dynamic between these two groups was very
complicated, but the simplest way to understand it is as a proxy war between Zulu
and Xhosa. The Inkatha was predominantly Zulu, very militant and very
nationalistic. The ANC was a broad coalition encompassing many different tribes,
but its leaders at the time were primarily Xhosa. Instead of uniting for peace they
turned on one another, committing acts of unbelievable savagery. Massive riots
broke out. Thousands of people were killed. Necklacing was common. That+IBk-s
where people would hold someone down and put a rubber tire over his torso,
pinning his arms. Then they+IBk-d douse him with petrol and set him on fire and burn
him alive. The ANC did it to Inkatha. Inkatha did it to the ANC. I saw one of those
charred bodies on the side of the road one day on my way to school. In the
evenings my mom and I would turn on our little black-and-white TV and watch
the news. A dozen people killed. Fifty people killed. A hundred people killed.
     Eden Park sat not far from the sprawling townships of the East Rand,
Thokoza and Katlehong, which were the sites of some of the most horrific
Inkatha+IBM-ANC clashes. Once a month at least we+IBk-d drive home and the
neighborhood would be on fire. Hundreds of rioters in the street. My mom would
edge the car slowly through the crowds and around blockades made of flaming
tires. Nothing burns like a tire+IBQ-it rages with a fury you can+IBk-t imagine. As we drove
past the burning blockades, it felt like we were inside an oven. I used to say to my
mom, +IBw-I think Satan burns tires in Hell.+IB0-
     Whenever the riots broke out, all our neighbors would wisely hole up behind
closed doors. But not my mom. She+IBk-d head straight out, and as we+IBk-d inch our way
past the blockades, she+IBk-d give the rioters this look. Let me pass. I+IBk-m not involved
in this shit. She was unwavering in the face of danger. That always amazed me. It
didn+IBk-t matter that there was a war on our doorstep. She had things to do, places to
be. It was the same stubbornness that kept her going to church despite a broken-
down car. There could be five hundred rioters with a blockade of burning tires on
the main road out of Eden Park, and my mother would say, +IBw-Get dressed. I+IBk-ve got
to go to work. You+IBk-ve got to go to school.+IB0-
     +IBw-But aren+IBk-t you afraid?+IB0- I+IBk-d say. +IBw-There+IBk-s only one of you and there+IBk-s so many
of them.+IB0-
    +IBw-Honey, I+IBk-m not alone,+IB0- she+IBk-d say. +IBw-I+IBk-ve got all of Heaven+IBk-s angels behind me.+IB0-
     +IBw-Well, it would be nice if we could see them,+IB0- I+IBk-d say. +IBw-Because I don+IBk-t think
the rioters know they+IBk-re there.+IB0-
     She+IBk-d tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by:
+IBw-If God is with me, who can be against me?+IB0- She was never scared. Even when she
should have been.
                                         +IBQ-
That carless Sunday we made our circuit of churches, ending up, as usual, at white
church. When we walked out of Rosebank Union it was dark and we were alone. It
had been an endless day of minibuses from mixed church to black church to white
church, and I was exhausted. It was nine o+IBk-clock at least. In those days, with all the
violence and riots going on, you did not want to be out that late at night. We were
standing at the corner of Jellicoe Avenue and Oxford Road, right in the heart of
Johannesburg+IBk-s wealthy, white suburbia, and there were no minibuses. The streets
were empty.
     I so badly wanted to turn to my mom and say, +IBw-You see? This is why God
wanted us to stay home.+IB0- But one look at the expression on her face, and I knew
better than to speak. There were times I could talk smack to my mom+IBQ-this was
not one of them.
     We waited and waited for a minibus to come by. Under apartheid the
government provided no public transportation for blacks, but white people still
needed us to show up to mop their floors and clean their bathrooms. Necessity
being the mother of invention, black people created their own transit system, an
informal network of bus routes, controlled by private associations operating
entirely outside the law. Because the minibus business was completely
unregulated, it was basically organized crime. Different groups ran different
routes, and they would fight over who controlled what. There was bribery and
general shadiness that went on, a great deal of violence, and a lot of protection
money paid to avoid violence. The one thing you didn+IBk-t do was steal a route from a
rival group. Drivers who stole routes would get killed. Being unregulated,
minibuses were also very unreliable. When they came, they came. When they
didn+IBk-t, they didn+IBk-t.
    Standing outside Rosebank Union, I was literally falling asleep on my feet.
Not a minibus in sight. Eventually my mother said, +IBw-Let+IBk-s hitchhike.+IB0- We walked
and walked, and after what felt like an eternity, a car drove up and stopped. The
driver offered us a ride, and we climbed in. We hadn+IBk-t gone ten feet when
suddenly a minibus swerved right in front of the car and cut us off.
     A Zulu driver got out with an iwisa, a large, traditional Zulu weapon+IBQ-a war
club, basically. They+IBk-re used to smash people+IBk-s skulls in. Another guy, his crony,
got out of the passenger side. They walked up to the driver+IBk-s side of the car we
were in, grabbed the man who+IBk-d offered us a ride, pulled him out, and started
shoving their clubs in his face. +IBw-Why are you stealing our customers? Why are you
picking people up?+IB0-
      It looked like they were going to kill this guy. I knew that happened
sometimes. My mom spoke up. +IBw-Hey, listen, he was just helping me. Leave him.
We+IBk-ll ride with you. That+IBk-s what we wanted in the first place.+IB0- So we got out of the
first car and climbed into the minibus.
     We were the only passengers in the minibus. In addition to being violent
gangsters, South African minibus drivers are notorious for complaining and
haranguing passengers as they drive. This driver was a particularly angry one. As
we rode along, he started lecturing my mother about being in a car with a man
who was not her husband. My mother didn+IBk-t suffer lectures from strange men. She
told him to mind his own business, and when he heard her speaking in Xhosa, that
really set him off. The stereotypes of Zulu and Xhosa women were as ingrained as
those of the men. Zulu women were well-behaved and dutiful. Xhosa women were
promiscuous and unfaithful. And here was my mother, his tribal enemy, a Xhosa
woman alone with two small children+IBQ-one of them a mixed child, no less. Not just
a whore but a whore who sleeps with white men. +IBw-Oh, you+IBk-re a Xhosa,+IB0- he said.
+IBw-That explains it. Climbing into strange men+IBk-s cars. Disgusting woman.+IB0-
    My mom kept telling him off and he kept calling her names, yelling at her
from the front seat, wagging his finger in the rearview mirror and growing more
and more menacing until finally he said, +IBw-That+IBk-s the problem with you Xhosa
women. You+IBk-re all sluts+IBQ-and tonight you+IBk-re going to learn your lesson.+IB0-
     He sped off. He was driving fast, and he wasn+IBk-t stopping, only slowing down
to check for traffic at the intersections before speeding through. Death was never
far away from anybody back then. At that point my mother could be raped. We
could be killed. These were all viable options. I didn+IBk-t fully comprehend the danger
we were in at the moment+ADs- I was so tired that I just wanted to sleep. Plus my mom
stayed very calm. She didn+IBk-t panic, so I didn+IBk-t know to panic. She just kept trying
to reason with him.
    +IBw-I+IBk-m sorry if we+IBk-ve upset you, bhuti. You can just let us out here+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Really, it+IBk-s fine. We can just walk+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
     He raced along Oxford Road, the lanes empty, no other cars out. I was sitting
closest to the minibus+IBk-s sliding door. My mother sat next to me, holding baby
Andrew. She looked out the window at the passing road and then leaned over to
me and whispered, +IBw-Trevor, when he slows down at the next intersection, I+IBk-m
going to open the door and we+IBk-re going to jump.+IB0-
     I didn+IBk-t hear a word of what she was saying, because by that point I+IBk-d
completely nodded off. When we came to the next traffic light, the driver eased off
the gas a bit to look around and check the road. My mother reached over, pulled
the sliding door open, grabbed me, and threw me out as far as she could. Then she
took Andrew, curled herself in a ball around him, and leaped out behind me.
     It felt like a dream until the pain hit. Bam+ACE- I smacked hard on the pavement.
My mother landed right beside me and we tumbled and tumbled and rolled and
rolled. I was wide awake now. I went from half asleep to What the hell?+ACE-
Eventually I came to a stop and pulled myself up, completely disoriented. I looked
around and saw my mother, already on her feet. She turned and looked at me and
screamed.
    +IBw-Run+ACEgHQ-
    So I ran, and she ran, and nobody ran like me and my mom.
     It+IBk-s weird to explain, but I just knew what to do. It was animal instinct,
learned in a world where violence was always lurking and waiting to erupt. In the
townships, when the police came swooping in with their riot gear and armored
cars and helicopters, I knew: Run for cover. Run and hide. I knew that as a five-
year-old. Had I lived a different life, getting thrown out of a speeding minibus
might have fazed me. I+IBk-d have stood there like an idiot, going, +IBw-What+IBk-s happening,
Mom? Why are my legs so sore?+IB0- But there was none of that. Mom said +IBw-run,+IB0- and
I ran. Like the gazelle runs from the lion, I ran.
    The men stopped the minibus and got out and tried to chase us, but they
didn+IBk-t stand a chance. We smoked them. I think they were in shock. I still
remember glancing back and seeing them give up with a look of utter
bewilderment on their faces. What just happened? Who+IBk-d have thought a woman
with two small children could run so fast? They didn+IBk-t know they were dealing
with the reigning champs of the Maryvale College sports day. We kept going and
going until we made it to a twenty-four-hour petrol station and called the police.
By then the men were long gone.
     I still didn+IBk-t know why any of this had happened+ADs- I+IBk-d been running on pure
adrenaline. Once we stopped running I realized how much pain I was in. I looked
down, and the skin on my arms was scraped and torn. I was cut up and bleeding
all over. Mom was, too. My baby brother was fine, though, incredibly. My mom
had wrapped herself around him, and he+IBk-d come through without a scratch. I
turned to her in shock.
    +IBw-What was that?+ACE- Why are we running?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-What do you mean, +IBg-Why are we running?+IBk- Those men were trying to kill us.+IB0-
    +IBw-You never told me that+ACE- You just threw me out of the car+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-I did tell you. Why didn+IBk-t you jump?+IB0-
    +IBw-Jump?+ACE- I was asleep+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-So I should have left you there for them to kill you?+IB0-
    +IBw-At least they would have woken me up before they killed me.+IB0-
    Back and forth we went. I was too confused and too angry about getting
thrown out of the car to realize what had happened. My mother had saved my life.
     As we caught our breath and waited for the police to come and drive us home,
she said, +IBw-Well, at least we+IBk-re safe, thank God.+IB0-
    But I was nine years old and I knew better. I wasn+IBk-t going to keep quiet this
time.
    +IBw-No, Mom+ACE- This was not thanks to God+ACE- You should have listened to God
when he told us to stay at home when the car wouldn+IBk-t start, because clearly the
Devil tricked us into coming out tonight.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, Trevor+ACE- That+IBk-s not how the Devil works. This is part of God+IBk-s plan, and if
He wanted us here then He had a reason+ICYgHQ-
     And on and on and there we were, back at it, arguing about God+IBk-s will. Finally
I said, +IBw-Look, Mom. I know you love Jesus, but maybe next week you could ask
him to meet us at our house. Because this really wasn+IBk-t a fun night.+IB0-
    She broke out in a huge smile and started laughing. I started laughing, too,
and we stood there, this little boy and his mom, our arms and legs covered in
blood and dirt, laughing together through the pain in the light of a petrol station
on the side of the road in the middle of the night.
A partheid was perfect racism. It took centuries to develop, starting all the way back in 1652
when the Dutch East India Company landed at the Cape of Good Hope and established a
trading colony, Kaapstad, later known as Cape Town, a rest stop for ships traveling between
Europe and India. To impose white rule, the Dutch colonists went to war with the natives,
ultimately developing a set of laws to subjugate and enslave them. When the British took over
the Cape Colony, the descendants of the original Dutch settlers trekked inland and developed
their own language, culture, and customs, eventually becoming their own people, the
Afrikaners+IBQ-the white tribe of Africa.
     The British abolished slavery in name but kept it in practice. They did so because, in the
mid-1800s, in what had been written off as a near-worthless way station on the route to the
Far East, a few lucky capitalists stumbled upon the richest gold and diamond reserves in the
world, and an endless supply of expendable bodies was needed to go in the ground and get it
all out.
    As the British Empire fell, the Afrikaner rose up to claim South Africa as his rightful
inheritance. To maintain power in the face of the country+IBk-s rising and restless black majority,
the government realized they needed a newer and more robust set of tools. They set up a
formal commission to go out and study institutionalized racism all over the world. They went
to Australia. They went to the Netherlands. They went to America. They saw what worked,
what didn+IBk-t. Then they came back and published a report, and the government used that
knowledge to build the most advanced system of racial oppression known to man.
    Apartheid was a police state, a system of surveillance and laws designed to keep black
people under total control. A full compendium of those laws would run more than three
thousand pages and weigh approximately ten pounds, but the general thrust of it should be
easy enough for any American to understand. In America you had the forced removal of the
native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of
those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.
                                                        BORN A CRIME



I grew up in South Africa during apartheid, which was awkward because I was
raised in a mixed family, with me being the mixed one in the family. My mother,
Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, is black. My father, Robert, is white. Swiss/German,
to be precise, which Swiss/Germans invariably are. During apartheid, one of the
worst crimes you could commit was having sexual relations with a person of
another race. Needless to say, my parents committed that crime.
     In any society built on institutionalized racism, race-mixing doesn+IBk-t merely
challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and
incoherent. Race-mixing proves that races can mix+IBQ-and in a lot of cases, want to
mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system,
race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason.
     Humans being humans and sex being sex, that prohibition never stopped
anyone. There were mixed kids in South Africa nine months after the first Dutch
boats hit the beach in Table Bay. Just like in America, the colonists here had their
way with the native women, as colonists so often do. Unlike in America, where
anyone with one drop of black blood automatically became black, in South Africa
mixed people came to be classified as their own separate group, neither black nor
white but what we call +IBw-colored.+IB0- Colored people, black people, white people, and
Indian people were forced to register their race with the government. Based on
those classifications, millions of people were uprooted and relocated. Indian areas
were segregated from colored areas, which were segregated from black areas+IBQ-all
of them segregated from white areas and separated from one another by buffer
zones of empty land. Laws were passed prohibiting sex between Europeans and
natives, laws that were later amended to prohibit sex between whites and all
nonwhites.
     The government went to insane lengths to try to enforce these new laws. The
penalty for breaking them was five years in prison. There were whole police
squads whose only job was to go around peeking through windows+IBQ-clearly an
assignment for only the finest law enforcement officers. And if an interracial
couple got caught, God help them. The police would kick down the door, drag the
people out, beat them, arrest them. At least that+IBk-s what they did to the black
person. With the white person it was more like, +IBw-Look, I+IBk-ll just say you were drunk,
but don+IBk-t do it again, eh? Cheers.+IB0- That+IBk-s how it was with a white man and a black
woman. If a black man was caught having sex with a white woman, he+IBk-d be lucky if
he wasn+IBk-t charged with rape.
     If you ask my mother whether she ever considered the ramifications of having
a mixed child under apartheid, she will say no. She wanted to do something,
figured out a way to do it, and then she did it. She had a level of fearlessness that
you have to possess to take on something like she did. If you stop to consider the
ramifications, you+IBk-ll never do anything. Still, it was a crazy, reckless thing to do. A
million things had to go right for us to slip through the cracks the way we did for
as long as we did.
                                          +IBQ-
Under apartheid, if you were a black man you worked on a farm or in a factory or
in a mine. If you were a black woman, you worked in a factory or as a maid. Those
were pretty much your only options. My mother didn+IBk-t want to work in a factory.
She was a horrible cook and never would have stood for some white lady telling
her what to do all day. So, true to her nature, she found an option that was not
among the ones presented to her: She took a secretarial course, a typing class. At
the time, a black woman learning how to type was like a blind person learning how
to drive. It+IBk-s an admirable effort, but you+IBk-re unlikely to ever be called upon to
execute the task. By law, white-collar jobs and skilled-labor jobs were reserved for
whites. Black people didn+IBk-t work in offices. My mom, however, was a rebel, and,
fortunately for her, her rebellion came along at the right moment.
     In the early 1980s, the South African government began making minor
reforms in an attempt to quell international protest over the atrocities and human
rights abuses of apartheid. Among those reforms was the token hiring of black
workers in low-level white-collar jobs. Like typists. Through an employment
agency she got a job as a secretary at ICI, a multinational pharmaceutical company
in Braamfontein, a suburb of Johannesburg.
     When my mom started working, she still lived with my grandmother in
Soweto, the township where the government had relocated my family decades
before. But my mother was unhappy at home, and when she was twenty-two she
ran away to live in downtown Johannesburg. There was only one problem: It was
illegal for black people to live there.
     The ultimate goal of apartheid was to make South Africa a white country, with
every black person stripped of his or her citizenship and relocated to live in the
homelands, the Bantustans, semi-sovereign black territories that were in reality
puppet states of the government in Pretoria. But this so-called white country could
not function without black labor to produce its wealth, which meant black people
had to be allowed to live near white areas in the townships, government-planned
ghettos built to house black workers, like Soweto. The township was where you
lived, but your status as a laborer was the only thing that permitted you to stay
there. If your papers were revoked for any reason, you could be deported back to
the homelands.
     To leave the township for work in the city, or for any other reason, you had to
carry a pass with your ID number+ADs- otherwise you could be arrested. There was also
a curfew: After a certain hour, blacks had to be back home in the township or risk
arrest. My mother didn+IBk-t care. She was determined to never go home again. So she
stayed in town, hiding and sleeping in public restrooms until she learned the rules
of navigating the city from the other black women who had contrived to live there:
prostitutes.
     Many of the prostitutes in town were Xhosa. They spoke my mother+IBk-s
language and showed her how to survive. They taught her how to dress up in a
pair of maid+IBk-s overalls to move around the city without being questioned. They
also introduced her to white men who were willing to rent out flats in town. A lot
of these men were foreigners, Germans and Portuguese who didn+IBk-t care about the
law and were happy to sign a lease giving a prostitute a place to live and work in
exchange for a steady piece on the side. My mom wasn+IBk-t interested in any such
arrangement, but thanks to her job she did have money to pay rent. She met a
German fellow through one of her prostitute friends, and he agreed to let her a flat
in his name. She moved in and bought a bunch of maid+IBk-s overalls to wear. She was
caught and arrested many times, for not having her ID on the way home from
work, for being in a white area after hours. The penalty for violating the pass laws
was thirty days in jail or a fine of fifty rand, nearly half her monthly salary. She
would scrape together the money, pay the fine, and go right back about her
business.
                                         +IBQ-
My mom+IBk-s secret flat was in a neighborhood called Hillbrow. She lived in number
203. Down the corridor was a tall, brown-haired, brown-eyed Swiss/German
expat named Robert. He lived in 206. As a former trading colony, South Africa has
always had a large expatriate community. People find their way here. Tons of
Germans. Lots of Dutch. Hillbrow at the time was the Greenwich Village of South
Africa. It was a thriving scene, cosmopolitan and liberal. There were galleries and
underground theaters where artists and performers dared to speak up and
criticize the government in front of integrated crowds. There were restaurants and
nightclubs, a lot of them foreign-owned, that served a mixed clientele, black
people who hated the status quo and white people who simply thought it
ridiculous. These people would have secret get-togethers, too, usually in
someone+IBk-s flat or in empty basements that had been converted into clubs.
Integration by its nature was a political act, but the get-togethers themselves
weren+IBk-t political at all. People would meet up and hang out, have parties.
     My mom threw herself into that scene. She was always out at some club, some
party, dancing, meeting people. She was a regular at the Hillbrow Tower, one of
the tallest buildings in Africa at that time. It had a nightclub with a rotating dance
floor on the top floor. It was an exhilarating time but still dangerous. Sometimes
the restaurants and clubs would get shut down, sometimes not. Sometimes the
performers and patrons would get arrested, sometimes not. It was a roll of the
dice. My mother never knew whom to trust, who might turn her in to the police.
Neighbors would report on one another. The girlfriends of the white men in my
mom+IBk-s block of flats had every reason to report a black woman+IBQ-a prostitute, no
doubt+IBQ-living among them. And you must remember that black people worked for
the government as well. As far as her white neighbors knew, my mom could have
been a spy posing as a prostitute posing as a maid, sent into Hillbrow to inform on
whites who were breaking the law. That+IBk-s how a police state works+IBQ-everyone
thinks everyone else is the police.
    Living alone in the city, not being trusted and not being able to trust, my
mother started spending more and more time in the company of someone with
whom she felt safe: the tall Swiss man down the corridor in 206. He was forty-six.
She was twenty-four. He was quiet and reserved+ADs- she was wild and free. She would
stop by his flat to chat+ADs- they+IBk-d go to underground get-togethers, go dancing at the
nightclub with the rotating dance floor. Something clicked.
     I know that there was a genuine bond and a love between my parents. I saw it.
But how romantic their relationship was, to what extent they were just friends, I
can+IBk-t say. These are things a child doesn+IBk-t ask. All I do know is that one day she
made her proposal.
    +IBw-I want to have a kid,+IB0- she told him.
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t want kids,+IB0- he said.
   +IBw-I didn+IBk-t ask you to have a kid. I asked you to help me to have my kid. I just
want the sperm from you.+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m Catholic,+IB0- he said. +IBw-We don+IBk-t do such things.+IB0-
     +IBw-You do know,+IB0- she replied, +IBw-that I could sleep with you and go away and you
would never know if you had a child or not. But I don+IBk-t want that. Honor me with
your yes so that I can live peacefully. I want a child of my own, and I want it from
you. You will be able to see it as much as you like, but you will have no obligations.
You don+IBk-t have to talk to it. You don+IBk-t have to pay for it. Just make this child for
me.+IB0-
     For my mother+IBk-s part, the fact that this man didn+IBk-t particularly want a family
with her, was prevented by law from having a family with her, was part of the
attraction. She wanted a child, not a man stepping in to run her life. For my
father+IBk-s part, I know that for a long time he kept saying no. Eventually he said yes.
Why he said yes is a question I will never have the answer to.
     Nine months after that yes, on February 20, 1984, my mother checked into
Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family,
pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The
doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and
pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes,
and regulations+IBQ-I was born a crime.
                                         +IBQ-
When the doctors pulled me out there was an awkward moment where they said,
+IBw-Huh. That+IBk-s a very light-skinned baby.+IB0- A quick scan of the delivery room
revealed no man standing around to take credit.
    +IBw-Who is the father?+IB0- they asked.
    +IBw-His father is from Swaziland,+IB0- my mother said, referring to the tiny,
landlocked kingdom in the west of South Africa.
     They probably knew she was lying, but they accepted it because they needed
an explanation. Under apartheid, the government labeled everything on your birth
certificate: race, tribe, nationality. Everything had to be categorized. My mother
lied and said I was born in KaNgwane, the semi-sovereign homeland for Swazi
people living in South Africa. So my birth certificate doesn+IBk-t say that I+IBk-m Xhosa,
which technically I am. And it doesn+IBk-t say that I+IBk-m Swiss, which the government
wouldn+IBk-t allow. It just says that I+IBk-m from another country.
     My father isn+IBk-t on my birth certificate. Officially, he+IBk-s never been my father.
And my mother, true to her word, was prepared for him not to be involved. She+IBk-d
rented a new flat for herself in Joubert Park, the neighborhood adjacent to
Hillbrow, and that+IBk-s where she took me when she left the hospital. The next week
she went to visit him, with no baby. To her surprise, he asked where I was. +IBw-You
said that you didn+IBk-t want to be involved,+IB0- she said. And he hadn+IBk-t, but once I
existed he realized he couldn+IBk-t have a son living around the corner and not be a
part of my life. So the three of us formed a kind of family, as much as our peculiar
situation would allow. I lived with my mom. We+IBk-d sneak around and visit my dad
when we could.
     Where most children are proof of their parents+IBk- love, I was the proof of their
criminality. The only time I could be with my father was indoors. If we left the
house, he+IBk-d have to walk across the street from us. My mom and I used to go to
Joubert Park all the time. It+IBk-s the Central Park of Johannesburg+IBQ-beautiful
gardens, a zoo, a giant chessboard with human-sized pieces that people would
play. My mother tells me that once, when I was a toddler, my dad tried to go with
us. We were in the park, he was walking a good bit away from us, and I ran after
him, screaming, +IBw-Daddy+ACE- Daddy+ACE- Daddy+ACEgHQ- People started looking. He panicked and
ran away. I thought it was a game and kept chasing him.
     I couldn+IBk-t walk with my mother, either+ADs- a light-skinned child with a black
woman would raise too many questions. When I was a newborn, she could wrap
me up and take me anywhere, but very quickly that was no longer an option. I was
a giant baby, an enormous child. When I was one you+IBk-d have thought I was two.
When I was two, you+IBk-d have thought I was four. There was no way to hide me.
     My mom, same as she+IBk-d done with her flat and with her maid+IBk-s uniforms,
found the cracks in the system. It was illegal to be mixed (to have a black parent
and a white parent), but it was not illegal to be colored (to have two parents who
were both colored). So my mom moved me around the world as a colored child.
She found a cr+AOg-che in a colored area where she could leave me while she was at
work. There was a colored woman named Queen who lived in our block of flats.
When we wanted to go out to the park, my mom would invite her to go with us.
Queen would walk next to me and act like she was my mother, and my mother
would walk a few steps behind, like she was the maid working for the colored
woman. I+IBk-ve got dozens of pictures of me walking with this woman who looks like
me but who isn+IBk-t my mother. And the black woman standing behind us who looks
like she+IBk-s photobombing the picture, that+IBk-s my mom. When we didn+IBk-t have a
colored woman to walk with us, my mom would risk walking me on her own. She
would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to
drop me and pretend I wasn+IBk-t hers, like I was a bag of weed.
     When I was born, my mother hadn+IBk-t seen her family in three years, but she
wanted me to know them and wanted them to know me, so the prodigal daughter
returned. We lived in town, but I would spend weeks at a time with my
grandmother in Soweto, often during the holidays. I have so many memories from
the place that in my mind it+IBk-s like we lived there, too.
     Soweto was designed to be bombed+IBQ-that+IBk-s how forward-thinking the
architects of apartheid were. The township was a city unto itself, with a population
of nearly one million. There were only two roads in and out. That was so the
military could lock us in, quell any rebellion. And if the monkeys ever went crazy
and tried to break out of their cage, the air force could fly over and bomb the shit
out of everyone. Growing up, I never knew that my grandmother lived in the
center of a bull+IBk-s-eye.
     In the city, as difficult as it was to get around, we managed. Enough people
were out and about, black, white, and colored, going to and from work, that we
could get lost in the crowd. But only black people were permitted in Soweto. It was
much harder to hide someone who looked like me, and the government was
watching much more closely. In the white areas you rarely saw the police, and if
you did it was Officer Friendly in his collared shirt and pressed pants. In Soweto
the police were an occupying army. They didn+IBk-t wear collared shirts. They wore
riot gear. They were militarized. They operated in teams known as flying squads,
because they would swoop in out of nowhere, riding in armored personnel carriers
+IBQ-hippos, we called them+IBQ-tanks with enormous tires and slotted holes in the side
of the vehicle to fire their guns out of. You didn+IBk-t mess with a hippo. You saw one,
you ran. That was a fact of life. The township was in a constant state of
insurrection+ADs- someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to
be suppressed. Playing in my grandmother+IBk-s house, I+IBk-d hear gunshots, screams,
tear gas being fired into crowds.
     My memories of the hippos and the flying squads come from when I was five
or six, when apartheid was finally coming apart. I never saw the police before that,
because we could never risk the police seeing me. Whenever we went to Soweto,
my grandmother refused to let me outside. If she was watching me it was, +IBw-No, no,
no. He doesn+IBk-t leave the house.+IB0- Behind the wall, in the yard, I could play, but not
in the street. And that+IBk-s where the rest of the boys and girls were playing, in the
street. My cousins, the neighborhood kids, they+IBk-d open the gate and head out and
roam free and come back at dusk. I+IBk-d beg my grandmother to go outside.
    +IBw-Please. Please, can I go play with my cousins?+IB0-
    +IBw-No+ACE- They+IBk-re going to take you+ACEgHQ-
     For the longest time I thought she meant that the other kids were going to
steal me, but she was talking about the police. Children could be taken. Children
were taken. The wrong color kid in the wrong color area, and the government
could come in, strip your parents of custody, haul you off to an orphanage. To
police the townships, the government relied on its network of impipis, the
anonymous snitches who+IBk-d inform on suspicious activity. There were also the
blackjacks, black people who worked for the police. My grandmother+IBk-s neighbor
was a blackjack. She had to make sure he wasn+IBk-t watching when she smuggled me
in and out of the house.
     My gran still tells the story of when I was three years old and, fed up with
being a prisoner, I dug a hole under the gate in the driveway, wriggled through,
and ran off. Everyone panicked. A search party went out and tracked me down. I
had no idea how much danger I was putting everyone in. The family could have
been deported, my gran could have been arrested, my mom might have gone to
prison, and I probably would have been packed off to a home for colored kids.
     So I was kept inside. Other than those few instances of walking in the park,
the flashes of memory I have from when I was young are almost all indoors, me
with my mom in her tiny flat, me by myself at my gran+IBk-s. I didn+IBk-t have any friends.
I didn+IBk-t know any kids besides my cousins. I wasn+IBk-t a lonely kid+IBQ-I was good at
being alone. I+IBk-d read books, play with the toy that I had, make up imaginary
worlds. I lived inside my head. I still live inside my head. To this day you can leave
me alone for hours and I+IBk-m perfectly happy entertaining myself. I have to
remember to be with people.
                                         +IBQ-
Obviously, I was not the only child born to black and white parents during
apartheid. Traveling around the world today, I meet other mixed South Africans
all the time. Our stories start off identically. We+IBk-re around the same age. Their
parents met at some underground party in Hillbrow or Cape Town. They lived in
an illegal flat. The difference is that in virtually every other case they left. The
white parent smuggled them out through Lesotho or Botswana, and they grew up
in exile, in England or Germany or Switzerland, because being a mixed family
under apartheid was just that unbearable.
      Once Mandela was elected we could finally live freely. Exiles started to return.
I met my first one when I was around seventeen. He told me his story, and I was
like, +IBw-Wait, what? You mean we could have left? That was an option?+IB0- Imagine
being thrown out of an airplane. You hit the ground and break all your bones, you
go to the hospital and you heal and you move on and finally put the whole thing
behind you+IBQ-and then one day somebody tells you about parachutes. That+IBk-s how I
felt. I couldn+IBk-t understand why we+IBk-d stayed. I went straight home and asked my
mom.
    +IBw-Why? Why didn+IBk-t we just leave? Why didn+IBk-t we go to Switzerland?+IB0-
   +IBw-Because I am not Swiss,+IB0- she said, as stubborn as ever. +IBw-This is my country.
Why should I leave?+IB0-
S outh Africa is a mix of the old and the new, the ancient and the modern, and South African
Christianity is a perfect example of this. We adopted the religion of our colonizers, but most
people held on to the old ancestral ways, too, just in case. In South Africa, faith in the Holy
Trinity exists quite comfortably alongside belief in witchcraft, in casting spells and putting
curses on one+IBk-s enemies.
    I come from a country where people are more likely to visit sangomas+IBQ-shamans,
traditional healers, pejoratively known as witch doctors+IBQ-than they are to visit doctors of
Western medicine. I come from a country where people have been arrested and tried for
witchcraft+IBQ-in a court of law. I+IBk-m not talking about the 1700s. I+IBk-m talking about five years ago. I
remember a man being on trial for striking another person with lightning. That happens a lot
in the homelands. There are no tall buildings, few tall trees, nothing between you and the sky,
so people get hit by lightning all the time. And when someone gets killed by lightning, everyone
knows it+IBk-s because somebody used Mother Nature to take out a hit. So if you had a beef with
the guy who got killed, someone will accuse you of murder and the police will come knocking.
   +IBw-Mr. Noah, you+IBk-ve been accused of murder. You used witchcraft to kill David Kibuuka by
causing him to be struck by lightning.+IB0-
    +IBw-What is the evidence?+IB0-
    +IBw-The evidence is that David Kibuuka got struck by lightning and it wasn+IBk-t even raining.+IB0-
    And you go to trial. The court is presided over by a judge. There is a docket. There is a
prosecutor. Your defense attorney has to prove lack of motive, go through the crime-scene
forensics, present a staunch defense. And your attorney+IBk-s argument can+IBk-t be +IBw-Witchcraft isn+IBk-t
real.+IB0- No, no, no. You+IBk-ll lose.

I grew up in a world run by women. My father was loving and devoted, but I could
only see him when and where apartheid allowed. My uncle Velile, my mom+IBk-s
younger brother, lived with my grandmother, but he spent most of his time at the
local tavern getting into fights.
     The only semi-regular male figure in my life was my grandfather, my mother+IBk-s
father, who was a force to be reckoned with. He was divorced from my
grandmother and didn+IBk-t live with us, but he was around. His name was
Temperance Noah, which was odd since he was not a man of moderation at all. He
was boisterous and loud. His nickname in the neighborhood was +IBw-Tat Shisha,+IB0-
which translates loosely to +IBw-the smokin+IBk- hot grandpa.+IB0- And that+IBk-s exactly who he
was. He loved the ladies, and the ladies loved him. He+IBk-d put on his best suit and
stroll through the streets of Soweto on random afternoons, making everybody
laugh and charming all the women he+IBk-d meet. He had a big, dazzling smile with
bright white teeth+IBQ-false teeth. At home, he+IBk-d take them out and I+IBk-d watch him do
that thing where he looked like he was eating his own face.
    We found out much later in life that he was bipolar, but before that we just
thought he was eccentric. One time he borrowed my mother+IBk-s car to go to the shop
for milk and bread. He disappeared and didn+IBk-t come home until late that night
when we were way past the point of needing the milk or the bread. Turned out
he+IBk-d passed a young woman at the bus stop and, believing no beautiful woman
should have to wait for a bus, he offered her a ride to where she lived+IBQ-three hours
away. My mom was furious with him because he+IBk-d cost us a whole tank of petrol,
which was enough to get us to work and school for two weeks.
    When he was up you couldn+IBk-t stop him, but his mood swings were wild. In his
youth he+IBk-d been a boxer, and one day he said I+IBk-d disrespected him and now he
wanted to box me. He was in his eighties. I was twelve. He had his fists up, circling
me. +IBw-Let+IBk-s go, Trevah+ACE- Come on+ACE- Put your fists up+ACE- Hit me+ACE- I+IBk-ll show you I+IBk-m still a
man+ACE- Let+IBk-s go+ACEgHQ- I couldn+IBk-t hit him because I wasn+IBk-t about to hit my elder. Plus I+IBk-d
never been in a fight and I wasn+IBk-t going to have my first one be with an eighty-
year-old man. I ran to my mom, and she got him to stop. The day after his
pugilistic rage, he sat in his chair and didn+IBk-t move or say a word all day.
     Temperance lived with his second family in the Meadowlands, and we visited
them sparingly because my mom was always afraid of being poisoned. Which was
a thing that would happen. The first family were the heirs, so there was always the
chance they might get poisoned by the second family. It was like Game of Thrones
with poor people. We+IBk-d go into that house and my mom would warn me.
    +IBw-Trevor, don+IBk-t eat the food.+IB0-
    +IBw-But I+IBk-m starving.+IB0-
    +IBw-No. They might poison us.+IB0-
     +IBw-Okay, then why don+IBk-t I just pray to Jesus and Jesus will take the poison out
of the food?+IB0-
    +IBw-Trevor+ACE- Sun+IBk-qhela+ACEgHQ-
    So I only saw my grandfather now and then, and when he was gone the house
was in the hands of women.
     In addition to my mom there was my aunt Sibongile+ADs- she and her first
husband, Dinky, had two kids, my cousins Mlungisi and Bulelwa. Sibongile was a
powerhouse, a strong woman in every sense, big-chested, the mother hen. Dinky,
as his name implies, was dinky. He was a small man. He was abusive, but not
really. It was more like he tried to be abusive, but he wasn+IBk-t very good at it. He was
trying to live up to this image of what he thought a husband should be, dominant,
controlling. I remember being told as a child, +IBw-If you don+IBk-t hit your woman, you
don+IBk-t love her.+IB0- That was the talk you+IBk-d hear from men in bars and in the streets.
     Dinky was trying to masquerade as this patriarch that he wasn+IBk-t. He+IBk-d slap my
aunt and hit her and she+IBk-d take it and take it, and then eventually she+IBk-d snap and
smack him down and put him back in his place. Dinky would always walk around
like, +IBw-I control my woman.+IB0- And you+IBk-d want to say, +IBw-Dinky, first of all, you don+IBk-t.
Second of all, you don+IBk-t need to. Because she loves you.+IB0- I can remember one day
my aunt had really had enough. I was in the yard and Dinky came running out of
the house screaming bloody murder. Sibongile was right behind him with a pot of
boiling water, cursing at him and threatening to douse him with it. In Soweto you
were always hearing about men getting doused with pots of boiling water+IBQ-often a
woman+IBk-s only recourse. And men were lucky if it was water. Some women used
hot cooking oil. Water was if the woman wanted to teach her man a lesson. Oil
meant she wanted to end it.
     My grandmother Frances Noah was the family matriarch. She ran the house,
looked after the kids, did the cooking and the cleaning. She+IBk-s barely five feet tall,
hunched over from years in the factory, but rock hard and still to this day very
active and very much alive. Where my grandfather was big and boisterous, my
grandmother was calm, calculating, with a mind as sharp as anything. If you need
to know anything in the family history, going back to the 1930s, she can tell you
what day it happened, where it happened, and why it happened. She remembers it
all.
    My great-grandmother lived with us as well. We called her Koko. She was
super old, well into her nineties, stooped and frail, completely blind. Her eyes had
gone white, clouded over by cataracts. She couldn+IBk-t walk without someone holding
her up. She+IBk-d sit in the kitchen next to the coal stove, bundled up in long skirts and
head scarves, blankets over her shoulders. The coal stove was always on. It was for
cooking, heating the house, heating water for baths. We put her there because it
was the warmest spot in the house. In the morning someone would wake her and
bring her to sit in the kitchen. At night someone would come take her to bed.
That+IBk-s all she did, all day, every day. Sit by the stove. She was fantastic and fully
with it. She just couldn+IBk-t see and didn+IBk-t move.
     Koko and my gran would sit and have long conversations, but as a five-year-
old I didn+IBk-t think of Koko as a real person. Since her body didn+IBk-t move, she was
like a brain with a mouth. Our relationship was nothing but command prompts
and replies, like talking to a computer.
       +IBw-Good morning, Koko.+IB0-
       +IBw-Good morning, Trevor.+IB0-
       +IBw-Koko, did you eat?+IB0-
       +IBw-Yes, Trevor.+IB0-
       +IBw-Koko, I+IBk-m going out.+IB0-
       +IBw-Okay, be careful.+IB0-
       +IBw-Bye, Koko.+IB0-
       +IBw-Bye, Trevor.+IB0-
                                         +IBQ-
The fact that I grew up in a world run by women was no accident. Apartheid kept
me away from my father because he was white, but for almost all the kids I knew
on my grandmother+IBk-s block in Soweto, apartheid had taken away their fathers as
well, just for different reasons. Their fathers were off working in a mine
somewhere, able to come home only during the holidays. Their fathers had been
sent to prison. Their fathers were in exile, fighting for the cause. Women held the
community together. +IBw-Wathint+IBk-Abafazi Wathint+IBk-imbokodo+ACEgHQ- was the chant they
would rally to during the freedom struggle. +IBw-When you strike a woman, you strike
a rock.+IB0- As a nation, we recognized the power of women, but in the home they
were expected to submit and obey.
      In Soweto, religion filled the void left by absent men. I used to ask my mom if
it was hard for her to raise me alone without a husband. She+IBk-d reply, +IBw-Just because
I live without a man doesn+IBk-t mean I+IBk-ve never had a husband. God is my husband.+IB0-
For my mom, my aunt, my grandmother, and all the other women on our street,
life centered on faith. Prayer meetings would rotate houses up and down the block
based on the day. These groups were women and children only. My mom would
always ask my uncle Velile to join, and he+IBk-d say, +IBw-I would join if there were more
men, but I can+IBk-t be the only one here.+IB0- Then the singing and praying would start,
and that was his cue to leave.
     For these prayer meetings, we+IBk-d jam ourselves into the tiny living area of the
host family+IBk-s house and form a circle. Then we would go around the circle offering
prayers. The grannies would talk about what was happening in their lives. +IBw-I+IBk-m
happy to be here. I had a good week at work. I got a raise and I wanted to say
thank you and praise Jesus.+IB0- Sometimes they+IBk-d pull out their Bible and say, +IBw-This
scripture spoke to me and maybe it will help you.+IB0- Then there would be a bit of
song. There was a leather pad called +IBw-the beat+IB0- that you+IBk-d strap to your palm, like a
percussion instrument. Someone would clap along on that, keeping time while
everyone sang, +IBw-Masango vulekani singene eJerusalema. Masango vulekani
singene eJerusalema.+IB0-
     That+IBk-s how it would go. Pray, sing, pray. Sing, pray, sing. Sing, sing, sing.
Pray, pray, pray. Sometimes it would last for hours, always ending with an
+IBw-amen,+IB0- and they could keep that +IBw-amen+IB0- going on for five minutes at least. +IBw-Ah-
men.       Ah-ah-ah-men.      Ah-ah-ah-ah-men.        Ahhhhhhhhahhhhh?hhhhh?-
hahhhhhahhhhhhahhhhhmen. Meni-meni-meni. Men-men-men. Ahhhhh?hhhhh?-
hhhhh?hhhhh?hhhhh?hhhhh?hhhhh?hhhhh?hhhhmmmmmmmennnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?-
nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?-
nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?nnnnn?-
n.+IB0- Then everyone would say goodbye and go home. Next night, different house,
same thing.
     Tuesday nights, the prayer meeting came to my grandmother+IBk-s house, and I
was always excited, for two reasons. One, I got to clap along on the beat for the
singing. And two, I loved to pray. My grandmother always told me that she loved
my prayers. She believed my prayers were more powerful, because I prayed in
English. Everyone knows that Jesus, who+IBk-s white, speaks English. The Bible is in
English. Yes, the Bible was not written in English, but the Bible came to South
Africa in English so to us it+IBk-s in English. Which made my prayers the best prayers
because English prayers get answered first. How do we know this? Look at white
people. Clearly they+IBk-re getting through to the right person. Add to that Matthew
19:14. +IBw-Suffer little children to come unto me,+IB0- Jesus said, +IBw-for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.+IB0- So if a child is praying in English? To White Jesus? That+IBk-s a
powerful combination right there. Whenever I prayed, my grandmother would
say, +IBw-That prayer is going to get answered. I can feel it.+IB0-
    Women in the township always had something to pray for+IBQ-money problems,
a son who+IBk-d been arrested, a daughter who was sick, a husband who drank.
Whenever the prayer meetings were at our house, because my prayers were so
good, my grandmother would want me to pray for everyone. She would turn to me
and say, +IBw-Trevor, pray.+IB0- And I+IBk-d pray. I loved doing it. My grandmother had
convinced me that my prayers got answered. I felt like I was helping people.
                                         +IBQ-
There is something magical about Soweto. Yes, it was a prison designed by our
oppressors, but it also gave us a sense of self-determination and control. Soweto
was ours. It had an aspirational quality that you don+IBk-t find elsewhere. In America
the dream is to make it out of the ghetto. In Soweto, because there was no leaving
the ghetto, the dream was to transform the ghetto.
     For the million people who lived in Soweto, there were no stores, no bars, no
restaurants. There were no paved roads, minimal electricity, inadequate sewerage.
But when you put one million people together in one place, they find a way to
make a life for themselves. A black-market economy rose up, with every type of
business being run out of someone+IBk-s house: auto mechanics, day care, guys selling
refurbished tires.
     The most common were the spaza shops and the shebeens. The spaza shops
were informal grocery stores. People would build a kiosk in their garage, buy
wholesale bread and eggs, and then resell them piecemeal. Everyone in the
township bought things in minute quantities because nobody had any money. You
couldn+IBk-t afford to buy a dozen eggs at a time, but you could buy two eggs because
that+IBk-s all you needed that morning. You could buy a quarter loaf of bread, a cup of
sugar. The shebeens were unlawful bars in the back of someone+IBk-s house. They+IBk-d
put chairs in their backyard and hang out an awning and run a speakeasy. The
shebeens were where men would go to drink after work and during prayer
meetings and most any other time of day as well.
     People built homes the way they bought eggs: a little at a time. Every family in
the township was allocated a piece of land by the government. You+IBk-d first build a
shanty on your plot, a makeshift structure of plywood and corrugated iron. Over
time, you+IBk-d save up money and build a brick wall. One wall. Then you+IBk-d save up
and build another wall. Then, years later, a third wall and eventually a fourth. Now
you had a room, one room for everyone in your family to sleep, eat, do everything.
Then you+IBk-d save up for a roof. Then windows. Then you+IBk-d plaster the thing. Then
your daughter would start a family. There was nowhere for them to go, so they+IBk-d
move in with you. You+IBk-d add another corrugated-iron structure onto your brick
room and slowly, over years, turn that into a proper room for them as well. Now
your house had two rooms. Then three. Maybe four. Slowly, over generations,
you+IBk-d keep trying to get to the point where you had a home.
     My grandmother lived in Orlando East. She had a two-room house. Not a
two-bedroom house. A two-room house. There was a bedroom, and then there was
basically a living room/kitchen/everything-else room. Some might say we lived
like poor people. I prefer +IBw-open plan.+IB0- My mom and I would stay there during
school holidays. My aunt and cousins would be there whenever she was on the
outs with Dinky. We all slept on the floor in one room, my mom and me, my aunt
and my cousins, my uncle and my grandmother and my great-grandmother. The
adults each had their own foam mattresses, and there was one big one that we+IBk-d
roll out into the middle, and the kids slept on that.
     We had two shanties in the backyard that my grandmother would rent out to
migrants and seasonal workers. We had a small peach tree in a tiny patch on one
side of the house and on the other side my grandmother had a driveway. I never
understood why my grandmother had a driveway. She didn+IBk-t have a car. She didn+IBk-t
know how to drive. Yet she had a driveway. All of our neighbors had driveways,
some with fancy, cast-iron gates. None of them had cars, either. There was no
future in which most of these families would ever have cars. There was maybe one
car for every thousand people, yet almost everyone had a driveway. It was almost
like building the driveway was a way of willing the car to happen. The story of
Soweto is the story of the driveways. It+IBk-s a hopeful place.
                                         +IBQ-
Sadly, no matter how fancy you made your house, there was one thing you could
never aspire to improve: your toilet. There was no indoor running water, just one
communal outdoor tap and one outdoor toilet shared by six or seven houses. Our
toilet was in a corrugated-iron outhouse shared among the adjoining houses.
Inside, there was a concrete slab with a hole in it and a plastic toilet seat on top+ADs-
there had been a lid at some point, but it had broken and disappeared long ago.
We couldn+IBk-t afford toilet paper, so on the wall next to the seat was a wire hanger
with old newspaper on it for you to wipe. The newspaper was uncomfortable, but
at least I stayed informed while I handled my business.
    The thing that I couldn+IBk-t handle about the outhouse was the flies. It was a
long drop to the bottom, and they were always down there, eating on the pile, and
I had an irrational, all-consuming fear that they were going to fly up and into my
bum.
     One afternoon, when I was around five years old, my gran left me at home for
a few hours to go run errands. I was lying on the floor in the bedroom, reading. I
needed to go, but it was pouring down rain. I was dreading going outside to use
the toilet, getting drenched running out there, water dripping on me from the
leaky ceiling, wet newspaper, the flies attacking me from below. Then I had an
idea. Why bother with the outhouse at all? Why not put some newspaper on the
floor and do my business like a puppy? That seemed like a fantastic idea. So that+IBk-s
what I did. I took the newspaper, laid it out on the kitchen floor, pulled down my
pants, and squatted and got to it.
     When you shit, as you first sit down, you+IBk-re not fully in the experience yet.
You are not yet a shitting person. You+IBk-re transitioning from a person about to shit
to a person who is shitting. You don+IBk-t whip out your smartphone or a newspaper
right away. It takes a minute to get the first shit out of the way and get in the zone
and get comfortable. Once you reach that moment, that+IBk-s when it gets really nice.
    It+IBk-s a powerful experience, shitting. There+IBk-s something magical about it,
profound even. I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings
us back down to earth and gives us humility. I don+IBk-t care who you are, we all shit
the same. Beyonc+AOk- shits. The pope shits. The Queen of England shits. When we
shit we forget our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or how rich we are.
All of that goes away.
     You are never more yourself than when you+IBk-re taking a shit. You have that
moment where you realize, This is me. This is who I am. You can pee without
giving it a second thought, but not so with shitting. Have you ever looked in a
baby+IBk-s eyes when it+IBk-s shitting? It+IBk-s having a moment of pure self-awareness. The
outhouse ruins that for you. The rain, the flies, you are robbed of your moment,
and nobody should be robbed of that. Squatting and shitting on the kitchen floor
that day, I was like, Wow. There are no flies. There+IBk-s no stress. This is really
great. I+IBk-m really enjoying this. I knew I+IBk-d made an excellent choice, and I was very
proud of myself for making it. I+IBk-d reached that moment where I could relax and be
with myself. Then I casually looked around the room and I glanced to my left and
there, just a few feet away, right next to the coal stove, was Koko.
     It was like the scene in Jurassic Park when the children turn and the T. rex is
right there. Her eyes were wide open, cloudy white and darting around the room. I
knew she couldn+IBk-t see me, but her nose was starting to crinkle+IBQ-she could sense
that something was wrong.
     I panicked. I was mid-shit. All you can do when you+IBk-re mid-shit is finish
shitting. My only option was to finish as quietly and as slowly as I could, so that+IBk-s
what I decided to do. Then: the softest plop of a little-boy turd on the newspaper.
Koko+IBk-s head snapped toward the sound.
    +IBw-Who+IBk-s there? Hallo? Hallo?+ACEgHQ-
    I froze. I held my breath and waited.
    +IBw-Who+IBk-s there?+ACE- Hallo?+ACEgHQ-
    I kept quiet, waited, then started again.
    +IBw-Is somebody there?+ACE- Trevor, is that you?+ACE- Frances? Hallo? Hallo?+IB0-
    She started calling out the whole family. +IBw-Nombuyiselo? Sibongile? Mlungisi?
Bulelwa? Who+IBk-s there? What+IBk-s happening?+IB0-
     It was like a game, like I was trying to hide and a blind woman was trying to
find me using sonar. Every time she called out, I froze. There would be complete
silence. +IBw-Who+IBk-s there?+ACE- Hallo?+ACEgHQ- I+IBk-d pause, wait for her to settle back in her chair,
and then I+IBk-d start up again.
    Finally, after what felt like forever, I finished. I stood up, took the newspaper
+IBQ-which is not the quietest thing+IBQ-and I slowwwwwly folded it over. It crinkled.
+IBw-Who+IBk-s there?+IB0- Again I paused, waited. Then I folded it over some more, walked
over to the rubbish bin, placed my sin at the bottom, and gingerly covered it with
the rest of the trash. Then I tiptoed back to the other room, curled up on the
mattress on the floor, and pretended to be asleep. The shit was done, no outhouse
involved, and Koko was none the wiser.
    Mission accomplished.
                                          +IBQ-
An hour later the rain had stopped. My grandmother came home. The second she
walked in, Koko called out to her.
    +IBw-Frances+ACE- Thank God you+IBk-re here. There+IBk-s something in the house.+IB0-
    +IBw-What was it?+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t know, but I could hear it, and there was a smell.+IB0-
    My gran started sniffing the air. +IBw-Dear Lord+ACE- Yes, I can smell it, too. Is it a rat?
Did something die? It+IBk-s definitely in the house.+IB0-
     They went back and forth about it, quite concerned, and then, as it was
getting dark, my mother came home from work. The second she walked in, my
gran called out to her.
    +IBw-Oh, Nombuyiselo+ACE- Nombuyiselo+ACE- There+IBk-s something in the house+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-What?+ACE- What do you mean?+IB0-
    Koko told her the story, the sounds, the smells.
     Then my mom, who has a keen sense of smell, started going around the
kitchen, sniffing. +IBw-Yes, I can smell it. I can find it+ICY-I can find it+ICYgHQ- She went to the
rubbish bin. +IBw-It+IBk-s in here.+IB0- She lifted out the rubbish, pulled out the folded
newspaper underneath, and opened it up, and there was my little turd. She
showed it to gran.
    +IBw-Look+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-What?+ACE- How did it get there?+ACEgHQ-
    Koko, still blind, still stuck in her chair, was dying to know what was
happening.
    +IBw-What+IBk-s going on?+ACEgHQ- she cried. +IBw-What+IBk-s going on?+ACE- Did you find it?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-It+IBk-s shit,+IB0- Mom said. +IBw-There+IBk-s shit in the bottom of the dustbin.+IB0-
    +IBw-But how?+ACEgHQ- Koko said. +IBw-There was no one here+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Are you sure there was no one here?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes. I called out to everyone. Nobody came.+IB0-
    My mother gasped. +IBw-We+IBk-ve been bewitched+ACE- It+IBk-s a demon+ACEgHQ-
     For my mother, this was the logical conclusion. Because that+IBk-s how witchcraft
works. If someone has put a curse on you or your home, there is always the
talisman or totem, a tuft of hair or the head of a cat, the physical manifestation of
the spiritual thing, proof of the demon+IBk-s presence.
    Once my mom found the turd, all hell broke loose. This was serious. They had
evidence. She came into the bedroom.
    +IBw-Trevor+ACE- Trevor+ACE- Wake up+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-What?+ACEgHQ- I said, playing dumb. +IBw-What+IBk-s going on?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Come+ACE- There+IBk-s a demon in the house+ACEgHQ-
     She took my hand and dragged me out of bed. It was all hands on deck, time
for action. The first thing we had to do was go outside and burn the shit. That+IBk-s
what you do with witchcraft+ADs- the only way to destroy it is to burn the physical
thing. We went out to the yard, and my mom put the newspaper with my little turd
on the driveway, lit a match, and set it on fire. Then my mom and my gran stood
around the burning shit, praying and singing songs of praise.
     The commotion didn+IBk-t stop there because when there+IBk-s a demon around, the
whole community has to join together to drive it out. If you+IBk-re not part of the
prayer, the demon might leave our house and go to your house and curse you. So
we needed everyone. The alarm was raised. The call went out. My tiny old gran
was out the gate, going up and down the block, calling to all the other old grannies
for an emergency prayer meeting. +IBw-Come+ACE- We+IBk-ve been bewitched+ACEgHQ-
     I stood there, my shit burning in the driveway, my poor aged grandmother
tottering up and down the street in a panic, and I didn+IBk-t know what to do. I knew
there was no demon, but there was no way I could come clean. The hiding I would
have to endure? Good Lord. Honesty was never the best policy when it came to a
hiding. I kept quiet.
     Moments later the grannies came streaming in with their Bibles, through the
gate and up the driveway, a dozen or more at least. Everyone went inside. The
house was packed. This was by far the biggest prayer meeting we+IBk-d ever had+IBQ-the
biggest thing that had ever happened in the history of our home, period. Everyone
sat in the circle, praying and praying, and the prayers were strong. The grannies
were chanting and murmuring and swaying back and forth, speaking in tongues. I
was doing my best to keep my head low and stay out of it. Then my grandmother
reached back and grabbed me, pulled me into the middle of the circle, and looked
into my eyes.
    +IBw-Trevor, pray.+IB0-
   +IBw-Yes+ACEgHQ- my mother said. +IBw-Help us+ACE- Pray, Trevor. Pray to God to kill the
demon+ACEgHQ-
      I was terrified. I believed in the power of prayer. I knew that my prayers
worked. So if I prayed to God to kill the thing that left the shit, and the thing that
left the shit was me, then God was going to kill me. I froze. I didn+IBk-t know what to
do. But all the grannies were looking at me, waiting for me to pray, so I prayed,
stumbling through as best I could.
      +IBw-Dear Lord, please protect us, um, you know, from whoever did this
      but, like, we don+IBk-t know what happened exactly and maybe it was a
      big misunderstanding and, you know, maybe we shouldn+IBk-t be quick
      to judge when we don+IBk-t know the whole story and, I mean, of course
      you know best, Heavenly Father, but maybe this time it wasn+IBk-t
      actually a demon, because who can say for certain, so maybe cut
      whoever it was a break+ICYgHQ-

     It was not my best performance. Eventually I wrapped it up and sat back
down. The praying continued. It went on for some time. Pray, sing, pray. Sing,
pray, sing. Sing, sing, sing. Pray, pray, pray. Then everyone finally felt that the
demon was gone and life could continue, and we had the big +IBw-amen+IB0- and everyone
said good night and went home.
     That night I felt terrible. Before bed, I quietly prayed, +IBw-God, I am so sorry for
all of this. I know this was not cool.+IB0- Because I knew: God answers your prayers.
God is your father. He+IBk-s the man who+IBk-s there for you, the man who takes care of
you. When you pray, He stops and He takes His time and He listens, and I had
subjected Him to two hours of old grannies praying when I knew that with all the
pain and suffering in the world He had more important things to deal with than
my shit.
W hen I was growing up we used to get American TV shows rebroadcast on our stations:
Doogie Howser, M.D.+ADs- Murder, She Wrote+ADs- Rescue 911 with William Shatner. Most of them
were dubbed into African languages. ALF was in Afrikaans. Transformers was in Sotho. But if
you wanted to watch them in English, the original American audio would be simulcast on the
radio. You could mute your TV and listen to that. Watching those shows, I realized that
whenever black people were on-screen speaking in African languages, they felt familiar to me.
They sounded like they were supposed to sound. Then I+IBk-d listen to them in simulcast on the
radio, and they would all have black American accents. My perception of them changed. They
didn+IBk-t feel familiar. They felt like foreigners.
    Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared
language says +IBw-We+IBk-re the same.+IB0- A language barrier says +IBw-We+IBk-re different.+IB0- The architects of
apartheid understood this. Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were
separated not just physically but by language as well. In the Bantu schools, children were only
taught in their home language. Zulu kids learned in Zulu. Tswana kids learned in Tswana.
Because of this, we+IBk-d fall into the trap the government had set for us and fight among
ourselves, believing that we were different.
    The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite:
convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the
color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it+IBk-s easily tricked. If you+IBk-re racist and you meet
someone who doesn+IBk-t look like you, the fact that he can+IBk-t speak like you reinforces your racist
preconceptions: He+IBk-s different, less intelligent. A brilliant scientist can come over the border
from Mexico to live in America, but if he speaks in broken English, people say, +IBw-Eh, I don+IBk-t
trust this guy.+IB0-
    +IBw-But he+IBk-s a scientist.+IB0-
    +IBw-In Mexican science, maybe. I don+IBk-t trust him.+IB0-
   However, if the person who doesn+IBk-t look like you speaks like you, your brain short-circuits
because your racism program has none of those instructions in the code. +IBw-Wait, wait,+IB0- your
mind says, +IBw-the racism code says if he doesn+IBk-t look like me he isn+IBk-t like me, but the language
code says if he speaks like me he+ICY-is like me? Something is off here. I can+IBk-t figure this out.+IB0-
                                                           CHAMELEON



One afternoon I was playing with my cousins. I was a doctor and they were my
patients. I was operating on my cousin Bulelwa+IBk-s ear with a set of matches when I
accidentally perforated her eardrum. All hell broke loose. My grandmother came
running in from the kitchen. +IBw-Kwenzeka ntoni?+ACEgHQ- +IBw-What+IBk-s happening?+ACEgHQ- There was
blood coming out of my cousin+IBk-s head. We were all crying. My grandmother
patched up Bulelwa+IBk-s ear and made sure to stop the bleeding. But we kept crying.
Because clearly we+IBk-d done something we were not supposed to do, and we knew
we were going to be punished. My grandmother finished up with Bulelwa+IBk-s ear
and whipped out a belt and she beat the shit out of Bulelwa. Then she beat the shit
out of Mlungisi, too. She didn+IBk-t touch me.
    Later that night my mother came home from work. She found my cousin with
a bandage over her ear and my gran crying at the kitchen table.
    +IBw-What+IBk-s going on?+IB0- my mom said.
     +IBw-Oh, Nombuyiselo,+IB0- she said. +IBw-Trevor is so naughty. He+IBk-s the naughtiest child
I+IBk-ve ever come across in my life.+IB0-
    +IBw-Then you should hit him.+IB0-
    +IBw-I can+IBk-t hit him.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why not?+IB0-
     +IBw-Because I don+IBk-t know how to hit a white child,+IB0- she said. +IBw-A black child, I
understand. A black child, you hit them and they stay black. Trevor, when you hit
him he turns blue and green and yellow and red. I+IBk-ve never seen those colors
before. I+IBk-m scared I+IBk-m going to break him. I don+IBk-t want to kill a white person. I+IBk-m
so afraid. I+IBk-m not going to touch him.+IB0- And she never did.
     My grandmother treated me like I was white. My grandfather did, too, only he
was even more extreme. He called me +IBw-Mastah.+IB0- In the car, he insisted on driving
me as if he were my chauffeur. +IBw-Mastah must always sit in the backseat.+IB0- I never
challenged him on it. What was I going to say? +IBw-I believe your perception of race is
flawed, Grandfather.+IB0- No. I was five. I sat in the back.
    There were so many perks to being +IBw-white+IB0- in a black family, I can+IBk-t even
front. I was having a great time. My own family basically did what the American
justice system does: I was given more lenient treatment than the black kids.
Misbehavior that my cousins would have been punished for, I was given a warning
and let off. And I was way naughtier than either of my cousins. It wasn+IBk-t even
close. If something got broken or if someone was stealing granny+IBk-s cookies, it was
me. I was trouble.
     My mom was the only force I truly feared. She believed if you spare the rod,
you spoil the child. But everyone else said, +IBw-No, he+IBk-s different,+IB0- and they gave me a
pass. Growing up the way I did, I learned how easy it is for white people to get
comfortable with a system that awards them all the perks. I knew my cousins were
getting beaten for things that I+IBk-d done, but I wasn+IBk-t interested in changing my
grandmother+IBk-s perspective, because that would mean I+IBk-d get beaten, too. Why
would I do that? So that I+IBk-d feel better? Being beaten didn+IBk-t make me feel better. I
had a choice. I could champion racial justice in our home, or I could enjoy
granny+IBk-s cookies. I went with the cookies.
                                         +IBQ-
At that point I didn+IBk-t think of the special treatment as having to do with color. I
thought of it as having to do with Trevor. It wasn+IBk-t, +IBw-Trevor doesn+IBk-t get beaten
because Trevor is white.+IB0- It was, +IBw-Trevor doesn+IBk-t get beaten because Trevor is
Trevor.+IB0- Trevor can+IBk-t go outside. Trevor can+IBk-t walk without supervision. It+IBk-s
because I+IBk-m me+ADs- that+IBk-s why this is happening. I had no other points of reference.
There were no other mixed kids around so that I could say, +IBw-Oh, this happens to
us.+IB0-
     Nearly one million people lived in Soweto. Ninety-nine point nine percent of
them were black+IBQ-and then there was me. I was famous in my neighborhood just
because of the color of my skin. I was so unique people would give directions using
me as a landmark. +IBw-The house on Makhalima Street. At the corner you+IBk-ll see a
light-skinned boy. Take a right there.+IB0-
     Whenever the kids in the street saw me they+IBk-d yell, +IBw-Indoda yomlungu+ACEgHQ- +IBw-The
white man+ACEgHQ- Some of them would run away. Others would call out to their parents
to come look. Others would run up and try to touch me to see if I was real. It was
pandemonium. What I didn+IBk-t understand at the time was that the other kids
genuinely had no clue what a white person was. Black kids in the township didn+IBk-t
leave the township. Few people had televisions. They+IBk-d seen the white police roll
through, but they+IBk-d never dealt with a white person face-to-face, ever.
     I+IBk-d go to funerals and I+IBk-d walk in and the bereaved would look up and see me
and they+IBk-d stop crying. They+IBk-d start whispering. Then they+IBk-d wave and say, +IBw-Oh+ACEgHQ-
like they were more shocked by me walking in than by the death of their loved
ones. I think people felt like the dead person was more important because a white
person had come to the funeral.
    After a funeral, the mourners all go to the house of the surviving family to eat.
A hundred people might show up, and you+IBk-ve got to feed them. Usually you get a
cow and slaughter it and your neighbors come over and help you cook. Neighbors
and acquaintances eat outside in the yard and in the street, and the family eats
indoors. Every funeral I ever went to, I ate indoors. It didn+IBk-t matter if we knew the
deceased or not. The family would see me and invite me in. +IBw-Awunakuvumela
umntana womlungu ame ngaphandle. Yiza naye apha ngaphakathi,+IB0- they+IBk-d say.
+IBw-You can+IBk-t let the white child stand outside. Bring him in here.+IB0-
     As a kid I understood that people were different colors, but in my head white
and black and brown were like types of chocolate. Dad was the white chocolate,
mom was the dark chocolate, and I was the milk chocolate. But we were all just
chocolate. I didn+IBk-t know any of it had anything to do with +IBw-race.+IB0- I didn+IBk-t know
what race was. My mother never referred to my dad as white or to me as mixed. So
when the other kids in Soweto called me +IBw-white,+IB0- even though I was light brown, I
just thought they had their colors mixed up, like they hadn+IBk-t learned them
properly. +IBw-Ah, yes, my friend. You+IBk-ve confused aqua with turquoise. I can see how
you made that mistake. You+IBk-re not the first.+IB0-
     I soon learned that the quickest way to bridge the race gap was through
language. Soweto was a melting pot: families from different tribes and homelands.
Most kids in the township spoke only their home language, but I learned several
languages because I grew up in a house where there was no option but to learn
them. My mom made sure English was the first language I spoke. If you+IBk-re black in
South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. English
is the language of money. English comprehension is equated with intelligence. If
you+IBk-re looking for a job, English is the difference between getting the job or
staying unemployed. If you+IBk-re standing in the dock, English is the difference
between getting off with a fine or going to prison.
    After English, Xhosa was what we spoke around the house. When my mother
was angry she+IBk-d fall back on her home language. As a naughty child, I was well
versed in Xhosa threats. They were the first phrases I picked up, mostly for my
own safety+IBQ-phrases like +IBw-Ndiza kubetha entloko.+IB0- +IBw-I+IBk-ll knock you upside the
head.+IB0- Or +IBw-Sidenge ndini somntwana.+IB0- +IBw-You idiot of a child.+IB0- It+IBk-s a very passionate
language. Outside of that, my mother picked up different languages here and
there. She learned Zulu because it+IBk-s similar to Xhosa. She spoke German because
of my father. She spoke Afrikaans because it is useful to know the language of your
oppressor. Sotho she learned in the streets.
     Living with my mom, I saw how she used language to cross boundaries,
handle situations, navigate the world. We were in a shop once, and the
shopkeeper, right in front of us, turned to his security guard and said, in
Afrikaans, +IBw-Volg daai swartes, netnou steel hulle iets.+IB0- +IBw-Follow those blacks in
case they steal something.+IB0-
    My mother turned around and said, in beautiful, fluent Afrikaans, +IBw-Hoekom
volg jy nie daai swartes sodat jy hulle kan help kry waarna hulle soek nie?+IB0- +IBw-Why
don+IBk-t you follow these blacks so you can help them find what they+IBk-re looking for?+IB0-
     +IBw-Ag, jammer+ACEgHQ- he said, apologizing in Afrikaans. Then+IBQ-and this was the
funny thing+IBQ-he didn+IBk-t apologize for being racist+ADs- he merely apologized for aiming
his racism at us. +IBw-Oh, I+IBk-m so sorry,+IB0- he said. +IBw-I thought you were like the other
blacks. You know how they love to steal.+IB0-
     I learned to use language like my mother did. I would simulcast+IBQ-give you the
program in your own tongue. I+IBk-d get suspicious looks from people just walking
down the street. +IBw-Where are you from?+IB0- they+IBk-d ask. I+IBk-d reply in whatever language
they+IBk-d addressed me in, using the same accent that they used. There would be a
brief moment of confusion, and then the suspicious look would disappear. +IBw-Oh,
okay. I thought you were a stranger. We+IBk-re good then.+IB0-
     It became a tool that served me my whole life. One day as a young man I was
walking down the street, and a group of Zulu guys was walking behind me, closing
in on me, and I could hear them talking to one another about how they were going
to mug me. +IBw-Asibambe le autie yomlungu. Phuma ngapha mina ngizoqhamuka
ngemuva kwakhe.+IB0- +IBw-Let+IBk-s get this white guy. You go to his left, and I+IBk-ll come up
behind him.+IB0- I didn+IBk-t know what to do. I couldn+IBk-t run, so I just spun around real
quick and said, +IBw-Kodwa bafwethu yingani singavele sibambe umuntu inkunzi?
Asenzeni. Mina ngikulindele.+IB0- +IBw-Yo, guys, why don+IBk-t we just mug someone
together? I+IBk-m ready. Let+IBk-s do it.+IB0-
     They looked shocked for a moment, and then they started laughing. +IBw-Oh,
sorry, dude. We thought you were something else. We weren+IBk-t trying to take
anything from you. We were trying to steal from white people. Have a good day,
man.+IB0- They were ready to do me violent harm, until they felt we were part of the
same tribe, and then we were cool. That, and so many other smaller incidents in
my life, made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are
to people.
     I became a chameleon. My color didn+IBk-t change, but I could change your
perception of my color. If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu. If you
spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn+IBk-t look like you,
but if I spoke like you, I was you.
                                          +IBQ-
As apartheid was coming to an end, South Africa+IBk-s elite private schools started
accepting children of all colors. My mother+IBk-s company offered bursaries,
scholarships, for underprivileged families, and she managed to get me into
Maryvale College, an expensive private Catholic school. Classes taught by nuns.
Mass on Fridays. The whole bit. I started preschool there when I was three,
primary school when I was five.
    In my class we had all kinds of kids. Black kids, white kids, Indian kids,
colored kids. Most of the white kids were pretty well off. Every child of color pretty
much wasn+IBk-t. But because of scholarships we all sat at the same table. We wore the
same maroon blazers, the same gray slacks and skirts. We had the same books. We
had the same teachers. There was no racial separation. Every clique was racially
mixed.
    Kids still got teased and bullied, but it was over usual kid stuff: being fat or
being skinny, being tall or being short, being smart or being dumb. I don+IBk-t
remember anybody being teased about their race. I didn+IBk-t learn to put limits on
what I was supposed to like or not like. I had a wide berth to explore myself. I had
crushes on white girls. I had crushes on black girls. Nobody asked me what I was. I
was Trevor.
     It was a wonderful experience to have, but the downside was that it sheltered
me from reality. Maryvale was an oasis that kept me from the truth, a comfortable
place where I could avoid making a tough decision. But the real world doesn+IBk-t go
away. Racism exists. People are getting hurt, and just because it+IBk-s not happening
to you doesn+IBk-t mean it+IBk-s not happening. And at some point, you have to choose.
Black or white. Pick a side. You can try to hide from it. You can say, +IBw-Oh, I don+IBk-t
pick sides,+IB0- but at some point life will force you to pick a side.
    At the end of grade six I left Maryvale to go to H. A. Jack Primary, a
government school. I had to take an aptitude test before I started, and, based on
the results of the test, the school counselor told me, +IBw-You+IBk-re going to be in the
smart classes, the A classes.+IB0- I showed up for the first day of school and went to
my classroom. Of the thirty or so kids in my class, almost all of them were white.
There was one Indian kid, maybe one or two black kids, and me.
    Then recess came. We went out on the playground, and black kids were
everywhere. It was an ocean of black, like someone had opened a tap and all the
black had come pouring out. I was like, Where were they all hiding? The white
kids I+IBk-d met that morning, they went in one direction, the black kids went in
another direction, and I was left standing in the middle, totally confused. Were we
going to meet up later on? I did not understand what was happening.
     I was eleven years old, and it was like I was seeing my country for the first
time. In the townships you don+IBk-t see segregation, because everyone is black. In the
white world, any time my mother took me to a white church, we were the only
black people there, and my mom didn+IBk-t separate herself from anyone. She didn+IBk-t
care. She+IBk-d go right up and sit with the white people. And at Maryvale, the kids
were mixed up and hanging out together. Before that day, I had never seen people
being together and yet not together, occupying the same space yet choosing not to
associate with each other in any way. In an instant I could see, I could feel, how
the boundaries were drawn. Groups moved in color patterns across the yard, up
the stairs, down the hall. It was insane. I looked over at the white kids I+IBk-d met that
morning. Ten minutes earlier I+IBk-d thought I was at a school where they were a
majority. Now I realized how few of them there actually were compared to
everyone else.
    I stood there awkwardly by myself in this no-man+IBk-s-land in the middle of the
playground. Luckily, I was rescued by the Indian kid from my class, a guy named
Theesan Pillay. Theesan was one of the few Indian kids in school, so he+IBk-d noticed
me, another obvious outsider, right away. He ran over to introduce himself.
+IBw-Hello, fellow anomaly+ACE- You+IBk-re in my class. Who are you? What+IBk-s your story?+IB0- We
started talking and hit it off. He took me under his wing, the Artful Dodger to my
bewildered Oliver.
     Through our conversation it came up that I spoke several African languages,
and Theesan thought a colored kid speaking black languages was the most
amazing trick. He brought me over to a group of black kids. +IBw-Say something,+IB0- he
told them, +IBw-and he+IBk-ll show you he understands you.+IB0- One kid said something in
Zulu, and I replied to him in Zulu. Everyone cheered. Another kid said something
in Xhosa, and I replied to him in Xhosa. Everyone cheered. For the rest of recess
Theesan took me around to different black kids on the playground. +IBw-Show them
your trick. Do your language thing.+IB0-
     The black kids were fascinated. In South Africa back then, it wasn+IBk-t common
to find a white person or a colored person who spoke African languages+ADs- during
apartheid white people were always taught that those languages were beneath
them. So the fact that I did speak African languages immediately endeared me to
the black kids.
    +IBw-How come you speak our languages?+IB0- they asked.
    +IBw-Because I+IBk-m black,+IB0- I said, +IBw-like you.+IB0-
    +IBw-You+IBk-re not black.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes, I am.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, you+IBk-re not. Have you not seen yourself?+IB0-
     They were confused at first. Because of my color, they thought I was a colored
person, but speaking the same languages meant that I belonged to their tribe. It
just took them a moment to figure it out. It took me a moment, too.
     At some point I turned to one of them and said, +IBw-Hey, how come I don+IBk-t see
you guys in any of my classes?+IB0- It turned out they were in the B classes, which also
happened to be the black classes. That same afternoon, I went back to the A
classes, and by the end of the day I realized that they weren+IBk-t for me. Suddenly, I
knew who my people were, and I wanted to be with them. I went to see the school
counselor.
    +IBw-I+IBk-d like to switch over,+IB0- I told her. +IBw-I+IBk-d like to go to the B classes.+IB0-
    She was confused. +IBw-Oh, no,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I don+IBk-t think you want to do that.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why not?+IB0-
    +IBw-Because those kids are+ICY-you know.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, I don+IBk-t know. What do you mean?+IB0-
    +IBw-Look,+IB0- she said, +IBw-you+IBk-re a smart kid. You don+IBk-t want to be in that class.+IB0-
    +IBw-But aren+IBk-t the classes the same? English is English. Math is math.+IB0-
     +IBw-Yeah, but that class is+ICY-those kids are gonna hold you back. You want to be in
the smart class.+IB0-
    +IBw-But surely there must be some smart kids in the B class.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, there aren+IBk-t.+IB0-
    +IBw-But all my friends are there.+IB0-
    +IBw-You don+IBk-t want to be friends with those kids.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes, I do.+IB0-
    We went back and forth. Finally she gave me a stern warning.
     +IBw-You do realize the effect this will have on your future? You do understand
what you+IBk-re giving up? This will impact the opportunities you+IBk-ll have open to you
for the rest of your life.+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-ll take that chance.+IB0-
    I moved to the B classes with the black kids. I decided I+IBk-d rather be held back
with people I liked than move ahead with people I didn+IBk-t know.
     Being at H. A. Jack made me realize I was black. Before that recess I+IBk-d never
had to choose, but when I was forced to choose, I chose black. The world saw me
as colored, but I didn+IBk-t spend my life looking at myself. I spent my life looking at
other people. I saw myself as the people around me, and the people around me
were black. My cousins are black, my mom is black, my gran is black. I grew up
black. Because I had a white father, because I+IBk-d been in white Sunday school, I got
along with the white kids, but I didn+IBk-t belong with the white kids. I wasn+IBk-t a part of
their tribe. But the black kids embraced me. +IBw-Come along,+IB0- they said. +IBw-You+IBk-re
rolling with us.+IB0- With the black kids, I wasn+IBk-t constantly trying to be. With the
black kids, I just was.
B efore apartheid, any black South African who received a formal education was likely taught
by European missionaries, foreign enthusiasts eager to Christianize and Westernize the
natives. In the mission schools, black people learned English, European literature, medicine,
the law. It+IBk-s no coincidence that nearly every major black leader of the anti-apartheid
movement, from Nelson Mandela to Steve Biko, was educated by the missionaries+IBQ-a
knowledgeable man is a free man, or at least a man who longs for freedom.
    The only way to make apartheid work, therefore, was to cripple the black mind. Under
apartheid, the government built what became known as Bantu schools. Bantu schools taught
no science, no history, no civics. They taught metrics and agriculture: how to count potatoes,
how to pave roads, chop wood, till the soil. +IBw-It does not serve the Bantu to learn history and
science because he is primitive,+IB0- the government said. +IBw-This will only mislead him, showing
him pastures in which he is not allowed to graze.+IB0- To their credit, they were simply being
honest. Why educate a slave? Why teach someone Latin when his only purpose is to dig holes
in the ground?
    Mission schools were told to conform to the new curriculum or shut down. Most of them
shut down, and black children were forced into crowded classrooms in dilapidated schools,
often with teachers who were barely literate themselves. Our parents and grandparents were
taught with little singsong lessons, the way you+IBk-d teach a preschooler shapes and colors. My
grandfather used to sing the songs and laugh about how silly they were. Two times two is four.
Three times two is six. La la la la la. We+IBk-re talking about fully grown teenagers being taught
this way, for generations.
    What happened with education in South Africa, with the mission schools and the Bantu
schools, offers a neat comparison of the two groups of whites who oppressed us, the British
and the Afrikaners. The difference between British racism and Afrikaner racism was that at
least the British gave the natives something to aspire to. If they could learn to speak correct
English and dress in proper clothes, if they could Anglicize and civilize themselves, one day
they might be welcome in society. The Afrikaners never gave us that option. British racism
said, +IBw-If the monkey can walk like a man and talk like a man, then perhaps he is a man.+IB0-
Afrikaner racism said, +IBw-Why give a book to a monkey?+IB0-
                                                 THE SECOND GIRL



My mother used to tell me, +IBw-I chose to have you because I wanted something to
love and something that would love me unconditionally in return.+IB0- I was a product
of her search for belonging. She never felt like she belonged anywhere. She didn+IBk-t
belong to her mother, didn+IBk-t belong to her father, didn+IBk-t belong with her siblings.
She grew up with nothing and wanted something to call her own.
     My grandparents+IBk- marriage was an unhappy one. They met and married in
Sophiatown, but one year later the army came in and drove them out. The
government seized their home and bulldozed the whole area to build a fancy, new
white suburb, Triomf. Triumph. Along with tens of thousands of other black
people, my grandparents were forcibly relocated to Soweto, to a neighborhood
called the Meadowlands. They divorced not long after that, and my grandmother
moved to Orlando with my mom, my aunt, and my uncle.
     My mom was the problem child, a tomboy, stubborn, defiant. My gran had no
idea how to raise her. Whatever love they had was lost in the constant fighting that
went on between them. But my mom adored her father, the charming, charismatic
Temperance. She went gallivanting with him on his manic misadventures. She+IBk-d
tag along when he+IBk-d go drinking in the shebeens. All she wanted in life was to
please him and be with him. She was always being swatted away by his girlfriends,
who didn+IBk-t like having a reminder of his first marriage hanging around, but that
only made her want to be with him all the more.
     When my mother was nine years old, she told my gran that she didn+IBk-t want to
live with her anymore. She wanted to live with her father. +IBw-If that+IBk-s what you
want,+IB0- Gran said, +IBw-then go.+IB0- Temperance came to pick my mom up, and she
happily bounded up into his car, ready to go and be with the man she loved. But
instead of taking her to live with him in the Meadowlands, without even telling her
why, he packed her off and sent her to live with his sister in the Xhosa homeland,
Transkei+IBQ-he didn+IBk-t want her, either. My mom was the middle child. Her sister
was the eldest and firstborn. Her brother was the only son, bearer of the family
name. They both stayed in Soweto, were both raised and cared for by their
parents. But my mom was unwanted. She was the second girl. The only place she
would have less value would be China.
     My mother didn+IBk-t see her family again for twelve years. She lived in a hut with
fourteen cousins+IBQ-fourteen children from fourteen different mothers and fathers.
All the husbands and uncles had gone off to the cities to find work, and the
children who weren+IBk-t wanted, or whom no one could afford to feed, had been sent
back to the homeland to live on this aunt+IBk-s farm.
     The homelands were, ostensibly, the original homes of South Africa+IBk-s tribes,
sovereign and semi-sovereign +IBw-nations+IB0- where black people would be +IBw-free.+IB0- Of
course, this was a lie. For starters, despite the fact that black people made up over
80 percent of South Africa+IBk-s population, the territory allocated for the homelands
was about 13 percent of the country+IBk-s land. There was no running water, no
electricity. People lived in huts.
      Where South Africa+IBk-s white countryside was lush and irrigated and green, the
black lands were overpopulated and overgrazed, the soil depleted and eroding.
Other than the menial wages sent home from the cities, families scraped by with
little beyond subsistence-level farming. My mother+IBk-s aunt hadn+IBk-t taken her in out
of charity. She was there to work. +IBw-I was one of the cows,+IB0- my mother would later
say, +IBw-one of the oxen.+IB0- She and her cousins were up at half past four, plowing
fields and herding animals before the sun baked the soil as hard as cement and
made it too hot to be anywhere but in the shade.
     For dinner there might be one chicken to feed fourteen children. My mom
would have to fight with the bigger kids to get a handful of meat or a sip of the
gravy or even a bone from which to suck out some marrow. And that+IBk-s when there
was food for dinner at all. When there wasn+IBk-t, she+IBk-d steal food from the pigs. She+IBk-d
steal food from the dogs. The farmers would put out scraps for the animals, and
she+IBk-d jump for it. She was hungry+ADs- let the animals fend for themselves. There were
times when she literally ate dirt. She would go down to the river, take the clay
from the riverbank, and mix it with the water to make a grayish kind of milk. She+IBk-d
drink that to feel full.
    But my mother was blessed that her village was one of the places where a
mission school had contrived to stay open in spite of the government+IBk-s Bantu
education policies. There she had a white pastor who taught her English. She
didn+IBk-t have food or shoes or even a pair of underwear, but she had English. She
could read and write. When she was old enough she stopped working on the farm
and got a job at a factory in a nearby town. She worked on a sewing machine
making school uniforms. Her pay at the end of each day was a plate of food. She
used to say it was the best food she+IBk-d ever eaten, because it was something she had
earned on her own. She wasn+IBk-t a burden to anyone and didn+IBk-t owe anything to
anyone.
     When my mom turned twenty-one, her aunt fell ill and that family could no
longer keep her in Transkei. My mom wrote to my gran, asking her to send the
price of a train ticket, about thirty rand, to bring her home. Back in Soweto, my
mom enrolled in the secretarial course that allowed her to grab hold of the bottom
rung of the white-collar world. She worked and worked and worked but, living
under my grandmother+IBk-s roof, she wasn+IBk-t allowed to keep her own wages. As a
secretary, my mom was bringing home more money than anyone else, and my
grandmother insisted it all go to the family. The family needed a radio, an oven, a
refrigerator, and it was now my mom+IBk-s job to provide it.
     So many black families spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the
past. That is the curse of being black and poor, and it is a curse that follows you
from generation to generation. My mother calls it +IBw-the black tax.+IB0- Because the
generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use
your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring
everyone behind you back up to zero. Working for the family in Soweto, my mom
had no more freedom than she+IBk-d had in Transkei, so she ran away. She ran all the
way down to the train station and jumped on a train and disappeared into the city,
determined to sleep in public restrooms and rely on the kindness of prostitutes
until she could make her own way in the world.
                                         +IBQ-
My mother never sat me down and told me the whole story of her life in Transkei.
She+IBk-d give me little bursts, random details, stories of having to keep her wits about
her to avoid getting raped by strange men in the village. She+IBk-d tell me these things
and I+IBk-d be like, Lady, clearly you do not know what kind of stories to be telling a
ten-year-old.
    My mom told me these things so that I+IBk-d never take for granted how we got to
where we were, but none of it ever came from a place of self-pity. +IBw-Learn from
your past and be better because of your past,+IB0- she would say, +IBw-but don+IBk-t cry about
your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don+IBk-t hold on to it.
Don+IBk-t be bitter.+IB0- And she never was. The deprivations of her youth, the betrayals of
her parents, she never complained about any of it.
     Just as she let the past go, she was determined not to repeat it: my childhood
would bear no resemblance to hers. She started with my name. The names Xhosa
families give their children always have a meaning, and that meaning has a way of
becoming self-fulfilling. You have my cousin, Mlungisi. +IBw-The Fixer.+IB0- That+IBk-s who he
is. Whenever I got into trouble he was the one trying to help me fix it. He was
always the good kid, doing chores, helping around the house. You have my uncle,
the unplanned pregnancy, Velile. +IBw-He Who Popped Out of Nowhere.+IB0- And that+IBk-s
all he+IBk-s done his whole life, disappear and reappear. He+IBk-ll go off on a drinking
binge and then pop back up out of nowhere a week later.
     Then you have my mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. +IBw-She Who Gives
Back.+IB0- That+IBk-s what she does. She gives and gives and gives. She did it even as a girl
in Soweto. Playing in the streets she would find toddlers, three- and four-year-
olds, running around unsupervised all day long. Their fathers were gone and their
mothers were drunks. My mom, who was only six or seven herself, used to round
up the abandoned kids and form a troop and take them around to the shebeens.
They+IBk-d collect empties from the men who were passed out and take the bottles to
where you could turn them in for a deposit. Then my mom would take that money,
buy food in the spaza shops, and feed the kids. She was a child taking care of
children.
     When it was time to pick my name, she chose Trevor, a name with no
meaning whatsoever in South Africa, no precedent in my family. It+IBk-s not even a
Biblical name. It+IBk-s just a name. My mother wanted her child beholden to no fate.
She wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone.
    She gave me the tools to do it as well. She taught me English as my first
language. She read to me constantly. The first book I learned to read was the book.
The Bible. Church was where we got most of our other books, too. My mom would
bring home boxes that white people had donated+IBQ-picture books, chapter books,
any book she could get her hands on. Then she signed up for a subscription
program where we got books in the mail. It was a series of how-to books. How to
Be a Good Friend. How to Be Honest. She bought a set of encyclopedias, too+ADs- it
was fifteen years old and way out of date, but I would sit and pore through those.
    My books were my prized possessions. I had a bookshelf where I put them,
and I was so proud of it. I loved my books and kept them in pristine condition. I
read them over and over, but I did not bend the pages or the spines. I treasured
every single one. As I grew older I started buying my own books. I loved fantasy,
loved to get lost in worlds that didn+IBk-t exist. I remember there was some book
about white boys who solved mysteries or some shit. I had no time for that. Give
me Roald Dahl. James and the Giant Peach, The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. That was my fix.
     I had to fight to convince my mom to get the Narnia books for me. She didn+IBk-t
like them.
    +IBw-This lion,+IB0- she said, +IBw-he is a false God+IBQ-a false idol+ACE- You remember what
happened when Moses came down from the mountain after he got the tablets+ICYgHQ-
    +IBw-Yes, Mom,+IB0- I explained, +IBw-but the lion is a Christ figure. Technically, he is
Jesus. It+IBk-s a story to explain Jesus.+IB0-
    She wasn+IBk-t comfortable with that. +IBw-No, no. No false idols, my friend.+IB0-
    Eventually I wore her down. That was a big win.
      If my mother had one goal, it was to free my mind. My mother spoke to me
like an adult, which was unusual. In South Africa, kids play with kids and adults
talk to adults. The adults supervise you, but they don+IBk-t get down on your level and
talk to you. My mom did. All the time. I was like her best friend. She was always
telling me stories, giving me lessons, Bible lessons especially. She was big into
Psalms. I had to read Psalms every day. She would quiz me on it. +IBw-What does the
passage mean? What does it mean to you? How do you apply it to your life?+IB0- That
was every day of my life. My mom did what school didn+IBk-t. She taught me how to
think.
                                         +IBQ-
The end of apartheid was a gradual thing. It wasn+IBk-t like the Berlin Wall where one
day it just came down. Apartheid+IBk-s walls cracked and crumbled over many years.
Concessions were made here and there, some laws were repealed, others simply
weren+IBk-t enforced. There came a point, in the months before Mandela+IBk-s release,
when we could live less furtively. It was then that my mother decided we needed to
move. She felt we had grown as much as we could hiding in our tiny flat in town.
     The country was open now. Where would we go? Soweto came with its
burdens. My mother still wanted to get out from the shadow of her family. My
mother also couldn+IBk-t walk with me through Soweto without people saying, +IBw-There
goes that prostitute with a white man+IBk-s child.+IB0- In a black area she would always be
seen as that. So, since my mom didn+IBk-t want to move to a black area and couldn+IBk-t
afford to move to a white area, she decided to move to a colored area.
     Eden Park was a colored neighborhood adjacent to several black townships
on the East Rand. Half-colored and half-black, she figured, like us. We+IBk-d be
camouflaged there. It didn+IBk-t work out that way+ADs- we never fit in at all. But that was
her thinking when we made the move. Plus it was a chance to buy a home+IBQ-our
own home. Eden Park was one of those +IBw-suburbs+IB0- that are actually out on the edge
of civilization, the kind of place where property developers have said, +IBw-Hey, poor
people. You can live the good life, too. Here+IBk-s a house. In the middle of nowhere.
But look, you have a yard+ACEgHQ- For some reason the streets in Eden Park were named
after cars: Jaguar Street. Ferrari Street. Honda Street. I don+IBk-t know if that was a
coincidence or not, but it+IBk-s funny because colored people in South Africa are
known for loving fancy cars. It was like living in a white neighborhood with all the
streets named after varietals of fine wine.
     I remember moving out there in flashbacks, snippets, driving to a place I+IBk-d
never seen, seeing people I+IBk-d never seen. It was flat, not many trees, the same
dusty red-clay dirt and grass as Soweto but with proper houses and paved roads
and a sense of suburbia to it. Ours was a tiny house at the bend in the road right
off Toyota Street. It was modest and cramped inside, but walking in I thought,
Wow. We are really living. It was crazy to have my own room. I didn+IBk-t like it. My
whole life I+IBk-d slept in a room with my mom or on the floor with my cousins. I was
used to having other human beings right next to me, so I slept in my mom+IBk-s bed
most nights.
    There was no stepfather in the picture yet, no baby brother crying in the
night. It was me and her, alone. There was this sense of the two of us embarking
on a grand adventure. She+IBk-d say things to me like, +IBw-It+IBk-s you and me against the
world.+IB0- I understood even from an early age that we weren+IBk-t just mother and son.
We were a team.
    It was when we moved to Eden Park that we finally got a car, the beat-up,
tangerine Volkswagen my mother bought secondhand for next to nothing. One out
of five times it wouldn+IBk-t start. There was no AC. Anytime I made the mistake of
turning on the fan the vent would fart bits of leaves and dust all over me.
Whenever it broke down we+IBk-d catch minibuses, or sometimes we+IBk-d hitchhike.
She+IBk-d make me hide in the bushes because she knew men would stop for a woman
but not a woman with a child. She+IBk-d stand by the road, the driver would pull over,
she+IBk-d open the door and then whistle, and I+IBk-d come running up to the car. I would
watch their faces drop as they realized they weren+IBk-t picking up an attractive single
woman but an attractive single woman with a fat little kid.
     When the car did work, we had the windows down, sputtering along and
baking in the heat. For my entire life the dial on that car+IBk-s radio stayed on one
station. It was called Radio Pulpit, and as the name suggests it was nothing but
preaching and praise. I wasn+IBk-t allowed to touch that dial. Anytime the radio wasn+IBk-t
getting reception, my mom would pop in a cassette of Jimmy Swaggart sermons.
(When we finally found out about the scandal? Oh, man. That was rough.)
     But as shitty as our car was, it was a car. It was freedom. We weren+IBk-t black
people stuck in the townships, waiting for public transport. We were black people
who were out in the world. We were black people who could wake up and say,
+IBw-Where do we choose to go today?+IB0- On the commute to work and school, there was
a long stretch of the road into town that was completely deserted. That+IBk-s where
Mom would let me drive. On the highway. I was six. She+IBk-d put me on her lap and
let me steer and work the indicators while she worked the pedals and the stick
shift. After a few months of that, she taught me how to work the stick. She was still
working the clutch, but I+IBk-d climb onto her lap and take the stick, and she+IBk-d call out
the gears as we drove. There was this one part of the road that ran deep into a
valley and then back up the other side. We+IBk-d get up a head of speed, and we+IBk-d stick
it into neutral and let go of the brake and the clutch, and, woo-hoo+ACE-, we+IBk-d race
down the hill and then, zoom+ACE-, we+IBk-d shoot up the other side. We were flying.
     If we weren+IBk-t at school or work or church, we were out exploring. My mom+IBk-s
attitude was +IBw-I chose you, kid. I brought you into this world, and I+IBk-m going to give
you everything I never had.+IB0- She poured herself into me. She would find places for
us to go where we didn+IBk-t have to spend money. We must have gone to every park
in Johannesburg. My mom would sit under a tree and read the Bible, and I+IBk-d run
and play and play and play. On Sunday afternoons after church, we+IBk-d go for drives
out in the country. My mom would find places with beautiful views for us to sit
and have a picnic. There was none of the fanfare of a picnic basket or plates or
anything like that, only baloney and brown bread and margarine sandwiches
wrapped up in butcher paper. To this day, baloney and brown bread and
margarine will instantly take me back. You can come with all the Michelin stars in
the world, just give me baloney and brown bread and margarine and I+IBk-m in
heaven.
    Food, or the access to food, was always the measure of how good or bad
things were going in our lives. My mom would always say, +IBw-My job is to feed your
body, feed your spirit, and feed your mind.+IB0- That+IBk-s exactly what she did, and the
way she found money for food and books was to spend absolutely nothing on
anything else. Her frugality was the stuff of legend. Our car was a tin can on
wheels, and we lived in the middle of nowhere. We had threadbare furniture,
busted old sofas with holes worn through the fabric. Our TV was a tiny black-and-
white with a bunny aerial on top. We changed the channels using a pair of pliers
because the buttons didn+IBk-t work. Most of the time you had to squint to see what
was going on.
    We always wore secondhand clothes, from Goodwill stores or that were
giveaways from white people at church. All the other kids at school got brands,
Nike and Adidas. I never got brands. One time I asked my mom for Adidas
sneakers. She came home with some knockoff brand, Abidas.
    +IBw-Mom, these are fake,+IB0- I said.
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t see the difference.+IB0-
    +IBw-Look at the logo. There are four stripes instead of three.+IB0-
    +IBw-Lucky you,+IB0- she said. +IBw-You got one extra.+IB0-
     We got by with next to nothing, but we always had church and we always had
books and we always had food. Mind you, it wasn+IBk-t necessarily good food. Meat
was a luxury. When things were going well we+IBk-d have chicken. My mom was an
expert at cracking open a chicken bone and getting out every last bit of marrow
inside. We didn+IBk-t eat chickens. We obliterated them. Our family was an
archaeologist+IBk-s nightmare. We left no bones behind. When we were done with a
chicken there was nothing left but the head. Sometimes the only meat we had was
a packaged meat you could buy at the butcher called +IBw-sawdust.+IB0- It was literally the
dust of the meat, the bits that fell off the cuts being packaged for the shop, the bits
of fat and whatever+IBk-s left. They+IBk-d sweep it up and put it into bags. It was meant for
dogs, but my mom bought it for us. There were many months where that was all
we ate.
     The butcher sold bones, too. We called them +IBw-soup bones,+IB0- but they were
actually labeled +IBw-dog bones+IB0- in the store+ADs- people would cook them for their dogs as
a treat. Whenever times were really tough we+IBk-d fall back on dog bones. My mom
would boil them for soup. We+IBk-d suck the marrow out of them. Sucking marrow out
of bones is a skill poor people learn early. I+IBk-ll never forget the first time I went to a
fancy restaurant as a grown man and someone told me, +IBw-You have to try the bone
marrow. It+IBk-s such a delicacy. It+IBk-s divine.+IB0- They ordered it, the waiter brought it out,
and I was like, +IBw-Dog bones, motherfucker+ACEgHQ- I was not impressed.
     As modestly as we lived at home, I never felt poor because our lives were so
rich with experience. We were always out doing something, going somewhere. My
mom used to take me on drives through fancy white neighborhoods. We+IBk-d go look
at people+IBk-s houses, look at their mansions. We+IBk-d look at their walls, mostly,
because that+IBk-s all we could see from the road. We+IBk-d look at a wall that ran from
one end of the block to the other and go, +IBw-Wow. That+IBk-s only one house. All of that
is for one family.+IB0- Sometimes we+IBk-d pull over and go up to the wall, and she+IBk-d put
me up on her shoulders like I was a little periscope. I would look into the yards
and describe everything I was seeing. +IBw-It+IBk-s a big white house+ACE- They have two dogs+ACE-
There+IBk-s a lemon tree+ACE- They have a swimming pool+ACE- And a tennis court+ACEgHQ-
     My mother took me places black people never went. She refused to be bound
by ridiculous ideas of what black people couldn+IBk-t or shouldn+IBk-t do. She+IBk-d take me to
the ice rink to go skating. Johannesburg used to have this epic drive-in movie
theater, Top Star Drive-In, on top of a massive mine dump outside the city. She+IBk-d
take me to movies there+ADs- we+IBk-d get snacks, hang the speaker on our car window.
Top Star had a 360-degree view of the city, the suburbs, Soweto. Up there I could
see for miles in every direction. I felt like I was on top of the world.
     My mom raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what
I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid+IBQ-not white
culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should
speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered.
     We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can
imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite
limited. Growing up in Soweto, our dream was to put another room on our house.
Maybe have a driveway. Maybe, someday, a cast-iron gate at the end of the
driveway. Because that is all we knew. But the highest rung of what+IBk-s possible is
far beyond the world you can see. My mother showed me what was possible. The
thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one
chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will.
     Perhaps even more amazing is the fact that my mother started her little
project, me, at a time when she could not have known that apartheid would end.
There was no reason to think it would end+ADs- it had seen generations come and go. I
was nearly six when Mandela was released, ten before democracy finally came, yet
she was preparing me to live a life of freedom long before we knew freedom would
exist. A hard life in the township or a trip to the colored orphanage were the far
more likely options on the table. But we never lived that way. We only moved
forward and we always moved fast, and by the time the law and everyone else
came around we were already miles down the road, flying across the freeway in a
bright-orange, piece-of-shit Volkswagen with the windows down and Jimmy
Swaggart praising Jesus at the top of his lungs.
     People thought my mom was crazy. Ice rinks and drive-ins and suburbs, these
things were izinto zabelungu+IBQ-the things of white people. So many black people
had internalized the logic of apartheid and made it their own. Why teach a black
child white things? Neighbors and relatives used to pester my mom. +IBw-Why do all
this? Why show him the world when he+IBk-s never going to leave the ghetto?+IB0-
    +IBw-Because,+IB0- she would say, +IBw-even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know
that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I+IBk-ve done enough.+IB0-
A partheid, for all its power, had fatal flaws baked in, starting with the fact that it never made
any sense. Racism is not logical. Consider this: Chinese people were classified as black in
South Africa. I don+IBk-t mean they were running around acting black. They were still Chinese.
But, unlike Indians, there weren+IBk-t enough Chinese people to warrant devising a whole
separate classification. Apartheid, despite its intricacies and precision, didn+IBk-t know what to do
with them, so the government said, +IBw-Eh, we+IBk-ll just call +IBk-em black. It+IBk-s simpler that way.+IB0-
    Interestingly, at the same time, Japanese people were labeled as white. The reason for this
was that the South African government wanted to establish good relations with the Japanese
in order to import their fancy cars and electronics. So Japanese people were given honorary
white status while Chinese people stayed black. I always like to imagine being a South African
policeman who likely couldn+IBk-t tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese but whose job
was to make sure that people of the wrong color weren+IBk-t doing the wrong thing. If he saw an
Asian person sitting on a whites-only bench, what would he say?
    +IBw-Hey, get off that bench, you Chinaman+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Excuse me. I+IBk-m Japanese.+IB0-
    +IBw-Oh, I apologize, sir. I didn+IBk-t mean to be racist. Have a lovely afternoon.+IB0-
                                                             LOOPHOLES



My mother used to tell me, +IBw-I chose to have you because I wanted something to
love and something that would love me unconditionally in return+IBQ-and then I gave
birth to the most selfish piece of shit on earth and all it ever did was cry and eat
and shit and say, +IBg-Me, me, me, me me.+IBk- +IB0-
     My mom thought having a child was going to be like having a partner, but
every child is born the center of its own universe, incapable of understanding the
world beyond its own wants and needs, and I was no different. I was a voracious
kid. I consumed boxes of books and wanted more, more, more. I ate like a pig. The
way I ate I should have been obese. At a certain point the family thought I had
worms. Whenever I went to my cousins+IBk- house for the holidays, my mom would
drop me off with a bag of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes and a large sack of
cornmeal. That was her way of preempting any complaints about my visit. At my
gran+IBk-s house I always got seconds, which none of the other kids got. My
grandmother would give me the pot and say, +IBw-Finish it.+IB0- If you didn+IBk-t want to wash
the dishes, you called Trevor. They called me the rubbish bin of the family. I ate
and ate and ate.
     I was hyperactive, too. I craved constant stimulation and activity. When I
walked down the sidewalk as a toddler, if you didn+IBk-t have my arm in a death grip, I
was off, running full-speed toward the traffic. I loved to be chased. I thought it was
a game. The old grannies my mom hired to look after me while she was at work? I
would leave them in tears. My mom would come home and they+IBk-d be crying. +IBw-I
quit. I can+IBk-t do this. Your son is a tyrant.+IB0- It was the same with my schoolteachers,
with Sunday school teachers. If you weren+IBk-t engaging me, you were in trouble. I
wasn+IBk-t a shit to people. I wasn+IBk-t whiny and spoiled. I had good manners. I was just
high-energy and knew what I wanted to do.
     My mom used to take me to the park so she could run me to death to burn off
the energy. She+IBk-d take a Frisbee and throw it, and I+IBk-d run and catch it and bring it
back. Over and over and over. Sometimes she+IBk-d throw a tennis ball. Black people+IBk-s
dogs don+IBk-t play fetch+ADs- you don+IBk-t throw anything to a black person+IBk-s dog unless it+IBk-s
food. So it was only when I started spending time in parks with white people and
their pets that I realized my mom was training me like a dog.
    Anytime my extra energy wasn+IBk-t burned off, it would find its way into general
naughtiness and misbehavior. I prided myself on being the ultimate prankster.
Every teacher at school used overhead projectors to put their notes up on the wall
during class. One day I went around and took the magnifying glass out of every
projector in every classroom. Another time I emptied a fire extinguisher into the
school piano, because I knew we were going to have a performance at assembly
the next day. The pianist sat down and played the first note and, foomp+ACE-, all this
foam exploded out of the piano.
      The two things I loved most were fire and knives. I was endlessly fascinated
by them. Knives were just cool. I collected them from pawnshops and garage sales:
flick knives, butterfly knives, the Rambo knife, the Crocodile Dundee knife. Fire
was the ultimate, though. I loved fire and I especially loved fireworks. We
celebrated Guy Fawkes Day in November, and every year my mom would buy us a
ton of fireworks, like a mini-arsenal. I realized that I could take the gunpowder out
of all the fireworks and create one massive firework of my own. One afternoon I
was doing precisely that, goofing around with my cousin and filling an empty
plant pot with a huge pile of gunpowder, when I got distracted by some Black Cat
firecrackers. The cool thing you could do with a Black Cat was, instead of lighting
it to make it explode, you could break it in half and light it and it would turn into a
mini-flamethrower. I stopped midway through building my gunpowder pile to
play with the Black Cats and somehow dropped a match into the pile. The whole
thing exploded, throwing a massive ball of flame up in my face. Mlungisi
screamed, and my mom came running into the yard in a panic.
    +IBw-What happened?+ACEgHQ-
     I played it cool, even though I could still feel the heat of the fireball on my
face. +IBw-Oh, nothing. Nothing happened.+IB0-
    +IBw-Were you playing with fire?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    She shook her head. +IBw-You know what? I would beat you, but Jesus has already
exposed your lies.+IB0-
    +IBw-Huh?+IB0-
    +IBw-Go to the bathroom and look at yourself.+IB0-
    I went to the toilet and looked in the mirror. My eyebrows were gone and the
front inch or so of my hair was completely burned off.
     From an adult+IBk-s point of view, I was destructive and out of control, but as a
child I didn+IBk-t think of it that way. I never wanted to destroy. I wanted to create. I
wasn+IBk-t burning my eyebrows. I was creating fire. I wasn+IBk-t breaking overhead
projectors. I was creating chaos, to see how people reacted.
    And I couldn+IBk-t help it. There+IBk-s a condition kids suffer from, a compulsive
disorder that makes them do things they themselves don+IBk-t understand. You can
tell a child, +IBw-Whatever you do, don+IBk-t draw on the wall. You can draw on this paper.
You can draw in this book. You can draw on any surface you want. But do not
draw or write or color on the wall.+IB0- The child will look you dead in the eye and say,
+IBw-Got it.+IB0- Ten minutes later the child is drawing on the wall. You start screaming.
+IBw-Why the hell are you drawing on the wall?+ACEgHQ- The child looks at you, and he
genuinely has no idea why he drew on the wall. As a kid, I remember having that
feeling all the time. Every time I got punished, as my mom was whooping my ass,
I+IBk-d be thinking, Why did I just do that? I knew not to do that. She told me not to
do that. Then once the hiding was over I+IBk-d say to myself, I+IBk-m going to be so good
from here on. I+IBk-m never ever going to do a bad thing in my life ever ever ever
ever ever+IBQ-and to remember not to do anything bad, let me write something on
the wall to remind myself+ICY-and then I would pick up a crayon and get straight
back into it, and I never understood why.
                                          +IBQ-
My relationship with my mom was like the relationship between a cop and a
criminal in the movies+IBQ-the relentless detective and the devious mastermind she+IBk-s
determined to catch. They+IBk-re bitter rivals, but, damn, they respect the hell out of
each other, and somehow they even grow to like each other. Sometimes my mom
would catch me, but she was usually one step behind, and she was always giving
me the eye. Someday, kid. Someday I+IBk-m going to catch you and put you away for
the rest of your life. Then I would give her a nod in return. Have a good evening,
Officer. That was my whole childhood.
     My mom was forever trying to rein me in. Over the years, her tactics grew
more and more sophisticated. Where I had youth and energy on my side, she had
cunning, and she figured out different ways to keep me in line. One Sunday we
were at the shops and there was a big display of toffee apples. I loved toffee apples,
and I kept nagging her the whole way through the shop. +IBw-Please can I have a toffee
apple? Please can I have a toffee apple? Please can I have a toffee apple? Please
can I have a toffee apple?+IB0-
     Finally, once we had our groceries and my mom was heading to the front to
pay, I succeeded in wearing her down. +IBw-Fine,+IB0- she said. +IBw-Go and get a toffee apple.+IB0-
I ran, got a toffee apple, came back, and put it on the counter at the checkout.
    +IBw-Add this toffee apple, please,+IB0- I said.
     The cashier looked at me skeptically. +IBw-Wait your turn, boy. I+IBk-m still helping
this lady.+IB0-
    +IBw-No,+IB0- I said. +IBw-She+IBk-s buying it for me.+IB0-
    My mother turned to me. +IBw-Who+IBk-s buying it for you?+IB0-
    +IBw-You+IBk-re buying it for me.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, no. Why doesn+IBk-t your mother buy it for you?+IB0-
    +IBw-What? My mother? You are my mother.+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m your mother? No, I+IBk-m not your mother. Where+IBk-s your mother?+IB0-
    I was so confused. +IBw-You+IBk-re my mother.+IB0-
    The cashier looked at her, looked back at me, looked at her again. She
shrugged, like, I have no idea what that kid+IBk-s talking about. Then she looked at
me like she+IBk-d never seen me before in her life.
    +IBw-Are you lost, little boy? Where+IBk-s your mother?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah,+IB0- the cashier said. +IBw-Where+IBk-s your mother?+IB0-
    I pointed at my mother. +IBw-She+IBk-s my mother.+IB0-
    +IBw-What? She can+IBk-t be your mother, boy. She+IBk-s black. Can+IBk-t you see?+IB0-
    My mom shook her head. +IBw-Poor little colored boy lost his mother. What a
shame.+IB0-
   I panicked. Was I crazy? Is she not my mother? I started bawling. +IBw-You+IBk-re my
mother. You+IBk-re my mother. She+IBk-s my mother. She+IBk-s my mother.+IB0-
    She shrugged again. +IBw-So sad. I hope he finds his mother.+IB0-
     The cashier nodded. She paid him, took our groceries, and walked out of the
shop. I dropped the toffee apple, ran out behind her in tears, and caught up to her
at the car. She turned around, laughing hysterically, like she+IBk-d really got me good.
    +IBw-Why are you crying?+IB0- she asked.
   +IBw-Because you said you weren+IBk-t my mother. Why did you say you weren+IBk-t my
mother?+IB0-
     +IBw-Because you wouldn+IBk-t shut up about the toffee apple. Now get in the car.
Let+IBk-s go.+IB0-
     By the time I was seven or eight, I was too smart to be tricked, so she changed
tactics. Our life turned into a courtroom drama with two lawyers constantly
debating over loopholes and technicalities. My mom was smart and had a sharp
tongue, but I was quicker in an argument. She+IBk-d get flustered because she couldn+IBk-t
keep up. So she started writing me letters. That way she could make her points
and there could be no verbal sparring back and forth. If I had chores to do, I+IBk-d
come home to find an envelope slipped under the door, like from the landlord.
      Dear Trevor,
      +IBw-Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.+IB0-
      +IBQ-Colossians 3:20
      There are certain things I expect from you as my child and as a young man. You need to
      clean your room. You need to keep the house clean. You need to look after your school
      uniform. Please, my child, I ask you. Respect my rules so that I may also respect you. I ask
      you now, please go and do the dishes and do the weeds in the garden.
      Yours sincerely,
      Mom
    I would do my chores, and if I had anything to say I would write back.
Because my mom was a secretary and I spent hours at her office every day after
school, I+IBk-d learned a great deal about business correspondence. I was extremely
proud of my letter-writing abilities.
      To Whom It May Concern:
      Dear Mom,
      I have received your correspondence earlier. I am delighted to say that I am ahead of
      schedule on the dishes and I will continue to wash them in an hour or so. Please note that
      the garden is wet and so I cannot do the weeds at this time, but please be assured this task
      will be completed by the end of the weekend. Also, I completely agree with what you are
      saying with regard to my respect levels and I will maintain my room to a satisfactory
      standard.
      Yours sincerely,
      Trevor

     Those were the polite letters. If we were having a real, full-on argument or if
I+IBk-d gotten in trouble at school, I+IBk-d find more accusatory missives waiting for me
when I got home.
      Dear Trevor,
      +IBw-Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child+ADs- the rod of discipline will remove it far from
      him.+IB0-
      +IBQ-Proverbs 22:15
      Your school marks this term have been very disappointing, and your behavior in class
      continues to be disruptive and disrespectful. It is clear from your actions that you do not
      respect me. You do not respect your teachers. Learn to respect the women in your life. The
      way you treat me and the way you treat your teachers will be the way you treat other women
      in the world. Learn to buck that trend now and you will be a better man because of it.
      Because of your behavior I am grounding you for one week. There will be no television and
      no videogames.
      Yours sincerely,
      Mom

    I, of course, would find this punishment completely unfair. I+IBk-d take the letter
and confront her.
    +IBw-Can I speak to you about this?+IB0-
    +IBw-No. If you want to reply, you have to write a letter.+IB0-
     I+IBk-d go to my room, get out my pen and paper, sit at my little desk, and go after
her arguments one by one.
      To Whom It May Concern:
      Dear Mom,
      First of all, this has been a particularly tough time in school, and for you to say that my
      marks are bad is extremely unfair, especially considering the fact that you yourself were not
      very good in school and I am, after all, a product of yours, and so in part you are to blame
      because if you were not good in school, why would I be good in school because genetically
      we are the same. Gran always talks about how naughty you were, so obviously my
      naughtiness comes from you, so I don+IBk-t think it is right or just for you to say any of this.
      Yours sincerely,
      Trevor

     I+IBk-d bring her the letter and stand there while she read it. Invariably she+IBk-d tear
it up and throw it in the dustbin. +IBw-Rubbish+ACE- This is rubbish+ACEgHQ- Then she+IBk-d start to
launch into me and I+IBk-d say, +IBw-Ah-ah-ah. No. You have to write a letter.+IB0- Then I+IBk-d go
to my room and wait for her reply. This sometimes went back and forth for days.
     The letter writing was for minor disputes. For major infractions, my mom
went with the ass-whooping. Like most black South African parents, when it came
to discipline my mom was old school. If I pushed her too far, she+IBk-d go for the belt
or switch. That+IBk-s just how it was in those days. Pretty much all of my friends had it
the same.
     My mom would have given me proper sit-down hidings if I+IBk-d given her the
opportunity, but she could never catch me. My gran called me +IBw-Springbok,+IB0- after
the second-fastest land mammal on earth, the deer that the cheetah hunts. My
mom had to become a guerrilla fighter. She got her licks in where she could, her
belt or maybe a shoe, administered on the fly.
     One thing I respected about my mom was that she never left me in any doubt
as to why I was receiving the hiding. It wasn+IBk-t rage or anger. It was discipline from
a place of love. My mom was on her own with a crazy child. I destroyed pianos. I
shat on floors. I would screw up, she+IBk-d beat the shit out of me and give me time to
cry, and then she+IBk-d pop back into my room with a big smile and go, +IBw-Are you ready
for dinner? We need to hurry and eat if we want to watch Rescue 911. Are you
coming?+IB0-
    +IBw-What? What kind of psychopath are you? You just beat me+ACEgHQ-
   +IBw-Yes. Because you did something wrong. It doesn+IBk-t mean I don+IBk-t love you
anymore.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-Look, did you or did you not do something wrong?+IB0-
    +IBw-I did.+IB0-
     +IBw-And then? I hit you. And now that+IBk-s over. So why sit there and cry? It+IBk-s time
for Rescue 911. William Shatner is waiting. Are you coming or not?+IB0-
                                                     +IBQ-
When it came to discipline, Catholic school was no joke. Whenever I got into
trouble with the nuns at Maryvale they+IBk-d rap me on the knuckles with the edge of a
metal ruler. For cursing they+IBk-d wash my mouth out with soap. For serious offenses
I+IBk-d get sent to the principal+IBk-s office. Only the principal could give you an official
hiding. You+IBk-d have to bend over and he+IBk-d hit your ass with this flat rubber thing,
like the sole of a shoe.
     Whenever the principal would hit me, it was like he was afraid to do it too
hard. One day I was getting a hiding and I thought, Man, if only my mom hit me
like this, and I started laughing. I couldn+IBk-t help it. The principal was quite
disturbed. +IBw-If you+IBk-re laughing while you+IBk-re getting beaten,+IB0- he said, +IBw-then
something is definitely wrong with you.+IB0-
     That was the first of three times the school made my mom take me to a
psychologist to be evaluated. Every psychologist who examined me came back and
said, +IBw-There+IBk-s nothing wrong with this kid.+IB0- I wasn+IBk-t ADD. I wasn+IBk-t a sociopath. I
was just creative and independent and full of energy. The therapists did give me a
series of tests, and they came to the conclusion that I was either going to make an
excellent criminal or be very good at catching criminals, because I could always
find loopholes in the law. Whenever I thought a rule wasn+IBk-t logical, I+IBk-d find my
way around it.
     The rules about communion at Friday mass, for example, made absolutely no
sense. We+IBk-d be in there for an hour of kneeling, standing, sitting, kneeling,
standing, sitting, kneeling, standing, sitting, and by the end of it I+IBk-d be starving,
but I was never allowed to take communion, because I wasn+IBk-t Catholic. The other
kids could eat Jesus+IBk-s body and drink Jesus+IBk-s blood, but I couldn+IBk-t. And Jesus+IBk-s
blood was grape juice. I loved grape juice. Grape juice and crackers+IBQ-what more
could a kid want? And they wouldn+IBk-t let me have any. I+IBk-d argue with the nuns and
the priest all the time.
    +IBw-Only Catholics can eat Jesus+IBk-s body and drink Jesus+IBk-s blood, right?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes.+IB0-
    +IBw-But Jesus wasn+IBk-t Catholic.+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Jesus was Jewish.+IB0-
    +IBw-Well, yes.+IB0-
    +IBw-So you+IBk-re telling me that if Jesus walked into your church right now, Jesus
would not be allowed to have the body and blood of Jesus?+IB0-
    +IBw-Well+ICY-uh+ICY-um+ICYgHQ-
    They never had a satisfactory reply.
     One morning before mass I decided, I+IBk-m going to get me some Jesus blood
and Jesus body. I snuck behind the altar and I drank the entire bottle of grape
juice and I ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times that I
couldn+IBk-t.
     In my mind, I wasn+IBk-t breaking the rules, because the rules didn+IBk-t make any
sense. And I got caught only because they broke their own rules. Another kid
ratted me out in confession, and the priest turned me in.
     +IBw-No, no,+IB0- I protested. +IBw-You+IBk-ve broken the rules. That+IBk-s confidential
information. The priest isn+IBk-t supposed to repeat what you say in confession.+IB0-
    They didn+IBk-t care. The school could break whatever rules it wanted. The
principal laid into me.
    +IBw-What kind of a sick person would eat all of Jesus+IBk-s body and drink all of
Jesus+IBk-s blood?+IB0-
    +IBw-A hungry person.+IB0-
     I got another hiding and a second trip to the psychologist for that one. The
third visit to the shrink, and the last straw, came in grade six. A kid was bullying
me. He said he was going to beat me up, and I brought one of my knives to school.
I wasn+IBk-t going to use it+ADs- I just wanted to have it. The school didn+IBk-t care. That was
the last straw for them. I wasn+IBk-t expelled, exactly. The principal sat me down and
said, +IBw-Trevor, we can expel you. You need to think hard about whether you really
want to be at Maryvale next year.+IB0- I think he thought he was giving me an
ultimatum that would get me to shape up. But I felt like he was offering me an out,
and I took it. +IBw-No,+IB0- I told him, +IBw-I don+IBk-t want to be here.+IB0- And that was the end of
Catholic school.
     Funnily enough, I didn+IBk-t get into trouble with my mom when it happened.
There was no ass-whooping waiting for me at home. She+IBk-d lost the bursary when
she+IBk-d left her job at ICI, and paying for private school was becoming a burden. But
more than that, she thought the school was overreacting. The truth is she probably
took my side against Maryvale more often than not. She agreed with me 100
percent about the Eucharist thing. +IBw-Let me get this straight,+IB0- she told the
principal. +IBw-You+IBk-re punishing a child because he wants Jesus+IBk-s body and Jesus+IBk-s
blood? Why shouldn+IBk-t he have those things? Of course he should have them.+IB0-
When they made me see a therapist for laughing while the principal hit me, she
told the school that was ridiculous, too.
    +IBw-Ms. Noah, your son was laughing while we were hitting him.+IB0-
    +IBw-Well, clearly you don+IBk-t know how to hit a kid. That+IBk-s your problem, not mine.
Trevor+IBk-s never laughed when I+IBk-ve hit him, I can tell you.+IB0-
    That was the weird and kind of amazing thing about my mom. If she agreed
with me that a rule was stupid, she wouldn+IBk-t punish me for breaking it. Both she
and the psychologists agreed that the school was the one with the problem, not
me. Catholic school is not the place to be creative and independent.
     Catholic school is similar to apartheid in that it+IBk-s ruthlessly authoritarian, and
its authority rests on a bunch of rules that don+IBk-t make any sense. My mother grew
up with these rules and she questioned them. When they didn+IBk-t hold up, she
simply went around them. The only authority my mother recognized was God+IBk-s.
God is love and the Bible is truth+IBQ-everything else was up for debate. She taught
me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on
her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.
                                         +IBQ-
When I was seven years old, my mother had been dating her new boyfriend, Abel,
for a year maybe, but at that point I was too young to know who they were to each
other. It was just +IBw-Hey, that+IBk-s mom+IBk-s friend who+IBk-s around a lot.+IB0- I liked Abel+ADs- he
was a really nice guy.
     As a black person back then, if you wanted to live in the suburbs you+IBk-d have to
find a white family renting out their servants+IBk- quarters or sometimes their garage,
which was what Abel had done. He lived in a neighborhood called Orange Grove in
a white family+IBk-s garage, which he+IBk-d turned into a cottage-type thing with a hot
plate and a bed. Sometimes he+IBk-d come and sleep at our house, and sometimes
we+IBk-d go stay with him. Staying in a garage when we owned our own house wasn+IBk-t
ideal, but Orange Grove was close to my school and my mom+IBk-s work so it had its
benefits.
     This white family also had a black maid who lived in the servants+IBk- quarters in
the backyard, and I+IBk-d play with her son whenever we stayed there. At that age my
love of fire was in full bloom. One afternoon everyone was at work+IBQ-my mom and
Abel and both of the white parents+IBQ-and the kid and I were playing together while
his mom was inside the house cleaning. One thing I loved doing at the time was
using a magnifying glass to burn my name into pieces of wood. You had to aim the
lens and get the focus just right and then you got the flame and then you moved it
slowly and you could burn shapes and letters and patterns. I was fascinated by it.
    That afternoon I was teaching this kid how to do it. We were inside the
servants+IBk- quarters, which was really more of a toolshed added on to the back of the
house, full of wooden ladders, buckets of old paint, turpentine. I had a box of
matches with me, too+IBQ-all my usual fire-making tools. We were sitting on an old
mattress that they used to sleep on the floor, basically a sack stuffed with dried
straw. The sun was beaming in through the window, and I was showing the kid
how to burn his name into a piece of plywood.
     At one point we took a break to go get a snack. I set the magnifying glass and
the matches on the mattress and we left. When we came back a few minutes later
we found the shed had one of those doors that self-locks from the inside. We
couldn+IBk-t get back in without going to get his mother, so we decided to run around
and play in the yard. After a while I noticed smoke coming out of the cracks in the
window frame. I ran over and looked inside. A small fire was burning in the
middle of the straw mattress where we+IBk-d left the matches and the magnifying
glass. We ran and called the maid. She came, but she didn+IBk-t know what to do. The
door was locked, and before we could figure out how to get into the shed the whole
thing caught+IBQ-the mattress, the ladders, the paint, the turpentine, everything.
    The flames moved quickly. Soon the roof was on fire, and from there the blaze
spread to the main house, and the whole thing burned and burned and burned.
Smoke was billowing into the sky. A neighbor had called the fire brigade, and the
sirens were on their way. Me and this kid and the maid, we ran out to the road and
watched as the firemen tried to put it out, but by the time they did, it was too late.
There was nothing left but a charred brick-and-mortar shell, roof gone, and gutted
from the inside.
     The white family came home and stood on the street, staring at the ruins of
their house. They asked the maid what happened and she asked her son and the
kid totally snitched. +IBw-Trevor had matches,+IB0- he said. The family said nothing to me.
I don+IBk-t think they knew what to say. They were completely dumbfounded. They
didn+IBk-t call the police, didn+IBk-t threaten to sue. What were they going to do, arrest a
seven-year-old for arson? And we were so poor you couldn+IBk-t actually sue us for
anything. Plus they had insurance, so that was the end of it.
     They kicked Abel out of the garage, which I thought was hilarious because the
garage, which was freestanding, was the only piece of the property left unscathed.
I saw no reason for Abel to have to leave, but they made him. We packed up his
stuff, put it into our car, and drove home to Eden Park+ADs- Abel basically lived with us
from then on. He and my mom got into a huge fight. +IBw-Your son has burned down
my life+ACEgHQ- But there was no punishment for me that day. My mom was too much in
shock. There+IBk-s naughty, and then there+IBk-s burning down a white person+IBk-s house.
She didn+IBk-t know what to do.
     I didn+IBk-t feel bad about it at all. I still don+IBk-t. The lawyer in me maintains that I
am completely innocent. There were matches and there was a magnifying glass
and there was a mattress and then, clearly, a series of unfortunate events. Things
catch fire sometimes. That+IBk-s why there+IBk-s a fire brigade. But everyone in my family
will tell you, +IBw-Trevor burned down a house.+IB0- If people thought I was naughty
before, after the fire I was notorious. One of my uncles stopped calling me Trevor.
He called me +IBw-Terror+IB0- instead. +IBw-Don+IBk-t leave that kid alone in your home,+IB0- he+IBk-d say.
+IBw-He+IBk-ll burn it to the ground.+IB0-
     My cousin Mlungisi, to this day, cannot comprehend how I survived being as
naughty as I was for as long as I did, how I withstood the number of hidings that I
got. Why did I keep misbehaving? How did I never learn my lesson? Both of my
cousins were supergood kids. Mlungisi got maybe one hiding in his life. After that
he said he never wanted to experience anything like it ever again, and from that
day he always followed the rules. But I was blessed with another trait I inherited
from my mother: her ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the thing that
caused the trauma, but I don+IBk-t hold on to the trauma. I never let the memory of
something painful prevent me from trying something new. If you think too much
about the ass-kicking your mom gave you, or the ass-kicking that life gave you,
you+IBk-ll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It+IBk-s better to take it,
spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on. You+IBk-ll have a few
bruises and they+IBk-ll remind you of what happened and that+IBk-s okay. But after a while
the bruises fade, and they fade for a reason+IBQ-because now it+IBk-s time to get up to
some shit again.
I  grew up in a black family in a black neighborhood in a black country. I+IBk-ve traveled to other
black cities in black countries all over the black continent. And in all of that time I+IBk-ve yet to
find a place where black people like cats. One of the biggest reasons for that, as we know in
South Africa, is that only witches have cats, and all cats are witches.
    There was a famous incident during an Orlando Pirates soccer match a few years ago. A
cat got into the stadium and ran through the crowd and out onto the pitch in the middle of the
game. A security guard, seeing the cat, did what any sensible black person would do. He said to
himself, +IBw-That cat is a witch.+IB0- He caught the cat and+IBQ-live on TV+IBQ-he kicked it and stomped it
and beat it to death with a sjambok, a hard leather whip.
     It was front-page news all over the country. White people lost their shit. Oh my word, it
was insane. The security guard was arrested and put on trial and found guilty of animal abuse.
He had to pay some enormous fine to avoid spending several months in jail. What was ironic
to me was that white people had spent years seeing video of black people being beaten to death
by other white people, but this one video of a black man kicking a cat, that+IBk-s what sent them
over the edge. Black people were just confused. They didn+IBk-t see any problem with what the
man did. They were like, +IBw-Obviously that cat was a witch. How else would a cat know how to
get out onto a soccer pitch? Somebody sent it to jinx one of the teams. That man had to kill the
cat. He was protecting the players.+IB0-
    In South Africa, black people have dogs.
                                                                                    FUFI



A month after we moved to Eden Park, my mother brought home two cats. Black
cats. Beautiful creatures. Some woman from her work had a litter of kittens she
was trying to get rid of, and my mom ended up with two. I was excited because I+IBk-d
never had a pet before. My mom was excited because she loves animals. She didn+IBk-t
believe in any nonsense about cats. It was just another way in which she was a
rebel, refusing to conform to ideas about what black people did and didn+IBk-t do.
     In a black neighborhood, you wouldn+IBk-t dare own a cat, especially a black cat.
That would be like wearing a sign that said, +IBw-Hello, I am a witch.+IB0- That would be
suicide. Since we+IBk-d moved to a colored neighborhood, my mom thought the cats
would be okay. Once they were grown we let them out during the day to roam the
neighborhood. Then we came home one evening and found the cats strung up by
their tails from our front gate, gutted and skinned and bleeding out, their heads
chopped off. On our front wall someone had written in Afrikaans,
+IBw-Heks+IB0gFCAc-Witch.+IB0-
     Colored people, apparently, were no more progressive than black people on
the issue of cats.
    I wasn+IBk-t exactly devastated about the cats. I don+IBk-t think we+IBk-d had them long
enough for me to get attached+ADs- I don+IBk-t even remember their names. And cats are
dicks for the most part. As much as I tried they never felt like real pets. They never
showed me affection nor did they accept any of mine. Had the cats made more of
an effort, I might have felt like I had lost something. But even as a kid, looking at
these dead, mutilated animals, I was like, +IBw-Well, there you have it. Maybe if they+IBk-d
been nicer, they could have avoided this.+IB0-
     After the cats were killed, we took a break from pets for a while. Then we got
dogs. Dogs are cool. Almost every black family I knew had a dog. No matter how
poor you were, you had a dog. White people treat dogs like children or members of
the family. Black people+IBk-s dogs are more for protection, a poor-man+IBk-s alarm
system. You buy a dog and you keep it out in the yard. Black people name dogs by
their traits. If it has stripes, you call it Tiger. If it+IBk-s vicious, you call it Danger. If it
has spots, you call it Spotty. Given the finite number of traits a dog can have,
pretty much everyone+IBk-s dogs have the same names+ADs- people just recycle them.
     We+IBk-d never had dogs in Soweto. Then one day some lady at my mom+IBk-s work
offered us two puppies. They weren+IBk-t planned puppies. This woman+IBk-s Maltese
poodle had been impregnated by the bull terrier from next door, a strange mix. My
mom said she+IBk-d take them both. She brought them home, and I was the happiest
kid on earth.
     My mom named them Fufi and Panther. Fufi, I don+IBk-t know where her name
came from. Panther had a pink nose, so she was Pink Panther and eventually just
Panther. They were two sisters who loved and hated each other. They would look
out for each other, but they would also fight all the time. Like, blood fights. Biting.
Clawing. It was a strange, gruesome relationship.
      Panther was my mom+IBk-s dog+ADs- Fufi was mine. Fufi was beautiful. Clean lines,
happy face. She looked like a perfect bull terrier, only skinnier because of the
Maltese mixed in. Panther, who was more half-and-half, came out weird and
scruffy-looking. Panther was smart. Fufi was dumb as shit. At least we always
thought she was dumb as shit. Whenever we called them, Panther would come
right away, but Fufi wouldn+IBk-t do anything. Panther would run back and get Fufi
and then they+IBk-d both come. It turned out that Fufi was deaf. Years later Fufi died
when a burglar was trying to break into our house. He pushed the gate over and it
fell on her back and broke her spine. We took her to the vet and she had to be put
down. After examining her, the vet came over and gave us the news.
     +IBw-It must have been strange for your family living with a dog that was deaf,+IB0- he
said.
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-You didn+IBk-t know your dog was deaf?+IB0-
    +IBw-No, we thought it was stupid.+IB0-
    That+IBk-s when we realized that their whole lives the one dog had been telling the
other dog what to do somehow. The smart, hearing one was helping the dumb,
deaf one.
     Fufi was the love of my life. Beautiful but stupid. I raised her. I potty-trained
her. She slept in my bed. A dog is a great thing for a kid to have. It+IBk-s like a bicycle
but with emotions.
      Fufi could do all sorts of tricks. She could jump super high. I mean, Fufi could
jump. I could hold a piece of food out above my own head and she+IBk-d leap up and
grab it like it was nothing. If YouTube had been around, Fufi would have been a
star.
    Fufi was a little rascal as well. During the day we kept the dogs in the
backyard, which was enclosed by a wall at least five feet high. After a while, every
day we+IBk-d come home and Fufi would be sitting outside the gate, waiting for us. We
were always confused. Was someone opening the gate? What was going on? It
never occurred to us that she could actually scale a five-foot wall, but that was
exactly what was happening. Every morning, Fufi would wait for us to leave, jump
over the wall, and go roaming around the neighborhood.
     I caught her one day when I was home for the school holidays. My mom had
left for work and I was in the living room. Fufi didn+IBk-t know I was there+ADs- she
thought I was gone because the car was gone. I heard Panther barking in the
backyard, looked out, and there was Fufi, scaling the wall. She+IBk-d jumped,
scampered up the last couple of feet, and then she was gone.
     I couldn+IBk-t believe this was happening. I ran out front, grabbed my bicycle, and
followed her to see where she was going. She went a long way, many streets over,
to another part of the neighborhood. Then she went up to this other house and
jumped over their wall and into their backyard. What the hell was she doing? I
went up to the gate and rang the doorbell. This colored kid answered.
    +IBw-May I help you?+IB0- he said.
    +IBw-Yeah. My dog is in your yard.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-My dog. She+IBk-s in your yard.+IB0-
    Fufi walked up and stood between us.
    +IBw-Fufi, come+ACEgHQ- I said. +IBw-Let+IBk-s go+ACEgHQ-
   This kid looked at Fufi and called her by some other stupid name, Spotty or
some bullshit like that.
    +IBw-Spotty, go back inside the house.+IB0-
    +IBw-Whoa, whoa,+IB0- I said. +IBw-Spotty? That+IBk-s Fufi+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-No, that+IBk-s my dog, Spotty.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, that+IBk-s Fufi, my friend.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, this is Spotty.+IB0-
    +IBw-How could this be Spotty? She doesn+IBk-t even have spots. You don+IBk-t know what
you+IBk-re talking about.+IB0-
    +IBw-This is Spotty+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Fufi+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Spotty+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Fufi+ACEgHQ-
     Of course, since Fufi was deaf she didn+IBk-t respond to +IBw-Spotty+IB0- or +IBw-Fufi.+IB0- She
just stood there. I started cursing the kid out.
    +IBw-Give me back my dog+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t know who you are,+IB0- he said, +IBw-but you better get out of here.+IB0-
    Then he went into the house and got his mom and she came out.
    +IBw-What do you want?+IB0- she said.
    +IBw-That+IBk-s my dog+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-This is our dog. Go away.+IB0-
     I started crying. +IBw-Why are you stealing my dog?+ACEgHQ- I turned to Fufi and begged
her. +IBw-Fufi, why are you doing this to me?+ACE- Why, Fufi?+ACE- Why?+ACEgHQ- I called to her. I
begged her to come. Fufi was deaf to my pleas. And everything else.
     I jumped onto my bike and raced home, tears running down my face. I loved
Fufi so much. To see her with another boy, acting like she didn+IBk-t know me, after I
raised her, after all the nights we spent together. I was heartbroken.
     That evening Fufi didn+IBk-t come home. Because the other family thought I was
coming to steal their dog, they had decided to lock her inside, so she couldn+IBk-t
make it back the way she normally did to wait for us outside the fence. My mom
got home from work. I was in tears. I told her Fufi had been kidnapped. We went
back to the house. My mom rang the bell and confronted the mom.
    +IBw-Look, this is our dog.+IB0-
    This lady lied to my mom+IBk-s face. +IBw-This is not your dog. We bought this dog.+IB0-
    +IBw-You didn+IBk-t buy the dog. It+IBk-s our dog.+IB0-
     They went back and forth. This woman wasn+IBk-t budging, so we went home to
get evidence: pictures of us with the dogs, certificates from the vet. I was crying
the whole time, and my mom was losing her patience with me. +IBw-Stop crying+ACE- We+IBk-ll
get the dog+ACE- Calm down+ACEgHQ-
     We gathered up our documentation and went back to the house. This time we
brought Panther with us, as part of the proof. My mom showed this lady the
pictures and the information from the vet. She still wouldn+IBk-t give us Fufi. My mom
threatened to call the police. It turned into a whole thing. Finally my mom said,
+IBw-Okay, I+IBk-ll give you a hundred rand.+IB0-
    +IBw-Fine,+IB0- the lady said.
     My mom gave her some money and she brought Fufi out. The other kid, who
thought Fufi was Spotty, had to watch his mother sell the dog he thought was his.
Now he started crying. +IBw-Spotty+ACE- No+ACE- Mom, you can+IBk-t sell Spotty+ACEgHQ- I didn+IBk-t care. I
just wanted Fufi back.
    Once Fufi saw Panther she came right away. The dogs left with us and we
walked. I sobbed the whole way home, still heartbroken. My mom had no time for
my whining.
    +IBw-Why are you crying?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Because Fufi loves another boy.+IB0-
    +IBw-So? Why would that hurt you? It didn+IBk-t cost you anything. Fufi+IBk-s here. She
still loves you. She+IBk-s still your dog. So get over it.+IB0-
     Fufi was my first heartbreak. No one has ever betrayed me more than Fufi. It
was a valuable lesson to me. The hard thing was understanding that Fufi wasn+IBk-t
cheating on me with another boy. She was merely living her life to the fullest.
Until I knew that she was going out on her own during the day, her other
relationship hadn+IBk-t affected me at all. Fufi had no malicious intent.
     I believed that Fufi was my dog, but of course that wasn+IBk-t true. Fufi was a dog.
I was a boy. We got along well. She happened to live in my house. That experience
shaped what I+IBk-ve felt about relationships for the rest of my life: You do not own
the thing that you love. I was lucky to learn that lesson at such a young age. I have
so many friends who still, as adults, wrestle with feelings of betrayal. They+IBk-ll come
to me angry and crying and talking about how they+IBk-ve been cheated on and lied to,
and I feel for them. I understand what they+IBk-re going through. I sit with them and
buy them a drink and I say, +IBw-Friend, let me tell you the story of Fufi.+IB0-
W hen I was twenty-four years old, one day out of the blue my mother said to me, +IBw-You need
to find your father.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why?+IB0- I asked. At that point I hadn+IBk-t seen him in over ten years and didn+IBk-t think I+IBk-d ever
see him again.
    +IBw-Because he+IBk-s a piece of you,+IB0- she said, +IBw-and if you don+IBk-t find him you won+IBk-t find yourself.+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t need him for that,+IB0- I said. +IBw-I know who I am.+IB0-
    +IBw-It+IBk-s not about knowing who you are. It+IBk-s about him knowing who you are, and you
knowing who he is. Too many men grow up without their fathers, so they spend their lives
with a false impression of who their father is and what a father should be. You need to find
your father. You need to show him what you+IBk-ve become. You need to finish that story.+IB0-
                                                                    ROBERT



My father is a complete mystery. There are so many questions about his life that I
still cannot even begin to answer.
    Where+IBk-d he grow up? Somewhere in Switzerland.
    Where+IBk-d he go to university? I don+IBk-t know if he did.
    How+IBk-d he end up in South Africa? I haven+IBk-t a clue.
    I+IBk-ve never met my Swiss grandparents. I don+IBk-t know their names or anything
about them. I do know my dad has an older sister, but I+IBk-ve never met her, either. I
know that he worked as a chef in Montreal and New York for a while before
moving to South Africa in the late 1970s. I know that he worked for an industrial
food-service company and that he opened a couple of bars and restaurants here
and there. That+IBk-s about it.
     I never called my dad +IBw-Dad.+IB0- I never addressed him +IBw-Daddy+IB0- or +IBw-Father,+IB0-
either. I couldn+IBk-t. I was instructed not to. If we were out in public or anywhere
people might overhear us and I called him +IBw-Dad,+IB0- someone might have asked
questions or called the police. So for as long as I can remember I always called him
Robert.
     While I know nothing of my dad+IBk-s life before me, thanks to my mom and just
from the time I have been able to spend with him, I do have a sense of who he is as
a person. He+IBk-s very Swiss, clean and particular and precise. He+IBk-s the only person I
know who checks into a hotel room and leaves it cleaner than when he arrived. He
doesn+IBk-t like anyone waiting on him. No servants, no housekeepers. He cleans up
after himself. He likes his space. He lives in his own world and does his own
everything.
     I know that he never married. He used to say that most people marry because
they want to control another person, and he never wanted to be controlled. I know
that he loves traveling, loves entertaining, having people over. But at the same
time his privacy is everything to him. Wherever he lives he+IBk-s never listed in the
phone book. I+IBk-m sure my parents would have been caught in their time together if
he hadn+IBk-t been as private as he is. My mom was wild and impulsive. My father was
reserved and rational. She was fire, he was ice. They were opposites that attracted,
and I am a mix of them both.
     One thing I do know about my dad is that he hates racism and homogeneity
more than anything, and not because of any feelings of self-righteousness or moral
superiority. He just never understood how white people could be racist in South
Africa. +IBw-Africa is full of black people,+IB0- he would say. +IBw-So why would you come all
the way to Africa if you hate black people? If you hate black people so much, why
did you move into their house?+IB0- To him it was insane.
     Because racism never made sense to my father, he never subscribed to any of
the rules of apartheid. In the early eighties, before I was born, he opened one of
the first integrated restaurants in Johannesburg, a steakhouse. He applied for a
special license that allowed businesses to serve both black and white patrons.
These licenses existed because hotels and restaurants needed them to serve black
travelers and diplomats from other countries, who in theory weren+IBk-t subject to the
same restrictions as black South Africans+ADs- black South Africans with money in
turn exploited that loophole to frequent those hotels and restaurants.
    My dad+IBk-s restaurant was an instant, booming success. Black people came
because there were few upscale establishments where they could eat, and they
wanted to come and sit in a nice restaurant and see what that was like. White
people came because they wanted to see what it was like to sit with black people.
The white people would sit and watch the black people eat, and the black people
would sit and eat and watch the white people watching them eat. The curiosity of
being together overwhelmed the animosity keeping people apart. The place had a
great vibe.
    The restaurant closed only because a few people in the neighborhood took it
upon themselves to complain. They filed petitions, and the government started
looking for ways to shut my dad down. At first the inspectors came and tried to get
him on cleanliness and health-code violations. Clearly they had never heard of the
Swiss. That failed dismally. Then they decided to go after him by imposing
additional and arbitrary restrictions.
     +IBw-Since you+IBk-ve got the license you can keep the restaurant open,+IB0- they said,
+IBw-but you+IBk-ll need to have separate toilets for every racial category. You+IBk-ll need white
toilets, black toilets, colored toilets, and Indian toilets.+IB0-
    +IBw-But then it will be a whole restaurant of nothing but toilets.+IB0-
     +IBw-Well, if you don+IBk-t want to do that, your other option is to make it a normal
restaurant and only serve whites.+IB0-
    He closed the restaurant.
     After apartheid fell, my father moved from Hillbrow to Yeoville, a formerly
quiet, residential neighborhood that had transformed into this vibrant melting pot
of black and white and every other hue. Immigrants were pouring in from Nigeria
and Ghana and all over the continent, bringing different food and exciting music.
Rockey Street was the main strip, and its sidewalks were filled with street vendors
and restaurants and bars. It was an explosion of culture.
     My dad lived two blocks over from Rockey, on Yeo Street, right next to this
incredible park where I loved to go because kids of all races and different
countries were running around and playing there. My dad+IBk-s house was simple.
Nice, but nothing fancy. I feel like my dad had enough money to be comfortable
and travel, but he never spent lavishly on things. He+IBk-s extremely frugal, the kind of
guy who drives the same car for twenty years.
     My father and I lived on a schedule. I visited him every Sunday afternoon.
Even though apartheid had ended, my mom had made her decision: She didn+IBk-t
want to get married. So we had our house, and he had his. I+IBk-d made a deal with my
mom that if I went with her to mixed church and white church in the morning,
after that I+IBk-d get to skip black church and go to my dad+IBk-s, where we+IBk-d watch
Formula 1 racing instead of casting out demons.
    I celebrated my birthday with my dad every year, and we spent Christmas
with him as well. I loved Christmas with my dad because my dad celebrated
European Christmas. European Christmas was the best Christmas ever. My dad
went all out. He had Christmas lights and a Christmas tree. He had fake snow and
snow globes and stockings hung by the fireplace and lots of wrapped presents
from Santa Claus. African Christmas was a lot more practical. We+IBk-d go to church,
come home, have a nice meal with good meat and lots of custard and jelly. But
there was no tree. You+IBk-d get a present, but it was usually just clothes, a new outfit.
You might get a toy, but it wasn+IBk-t wrapped and it was never from Santa Claus. The
whole issue of Santa Claus is a rather contentious one when it comes to African
Christmas, a matter of pride. When an African dad buys his kid a present, the last
thing he+IBk-s going to do is give some fat white man credit for it. African Dad will tell
you straight up, +IBw-No, no, no. I bought you that.+IB0-
     Outside of birthdays and special occasions, all we had were our Sunday
afternoons. He would cook for me. He+IBk-d ask me what I wanted, and I+IBk-d always
request the exact same meal, a German dish called R+APY-sti, which is basically a
pancake made out of potatoes and some sort of meat with a gravy. I+IBk-d have that
and a bottle of Sprite, and for dessert a plastic container of custard with caramel
on top.
     A good chunk of those afternoons would pass in silence. My dad didn+IBk-t talk
much. He was caring and devoted, attentive to detail, always a card on my
birthday, always my favorite food and toys when I came for a visit. But at the same
time he was a closed book. We+IBk-d talk about the food he was making, talk about the
F1 racing we+IBk-d watched. Every now and then he+IBk-d drop a tidbit of information,
about a place he+IBk-d visited or his steakhouse. But that was it. Being with my dad
was like watching a web series. I+IBk-d get a few minutes of information a few minutes
at a time, then I+IBk-d have to wait a week for the next installment.
                                         +IBQ-
When I was thirteen my dad moved to Cape Town, and we lost touch. We+IBk-d been
losing touch for a while, for a couple of reasons. I was a teenager. I had a whole
other world I was dealing with now. Videogames and computers meant more to
me than spending time with my parents. Also, my mom had married Abel. He was
incensed by the idea of my mom being in contact with her previous love, and she
decided it was safer for everyone involved not to test his anger. I went from seeing
my dad every Sunday to seeing him every other Sunday, maybe once a month,
whenever my mom could sneak me over, same as she+IBk-d done back in Hillbrow.
We+IBk-d gone from living under apartheid to living under another kind of tyranny,
that of an abusive, alcoholic man.
    At the same time, Yeoville had started to suffer from white flight, neglect,
general decline. Most of my dad+IBk-s German friends had left for Cape Town. If he
wasn+IBk-t seeing me, he had no reason to stay, so he left. His leaving wasn+IBk-t anything
traumatic, because it never registered that we might lose touch and never see each
other again. In my mind it was just Dad+IBk-s moving to Cape Town for a bit.
Whatever.
     Then he was gone. I stayed busy living my life, surviving high school,
surviving my early twenties, becoming a comedian. My career took off quickly. I
got a radio DJ gig and hosted a kids+IBk- adventure reality show on television. I was
headlining at clubs all over the country. But even as my life was moving forward,
the questions about my dad were always there in the back of my mind, bubbling
up to the surface now and then. +IBw-I wonder where he is. Does he think about me?
Does he know what I+IBk-m doing? Is he proud of me?+IB0- When a parent is absent,
you+IBk-re left in the lurch of not knowing, and it+IBk-s so easy to fill that space with
negative thoughts. +IBw-They don+IBk-t care.+IB0- +IBw-They+IBk-re selfish.+IB0- My one saving grace was
that my mom never spoke ill of him. She would always compliment him. +IBw-You+IBk-re
good with your money. You get that from your dad.+IB0- +IBw-You have your dad+IBk-s smile.+IB0-
+IBw-You+IBk-re clean and tidy like your father.+IB0- I never turned to bitterness, because she
made sure I knew his absence was because of circumstance and not a lack of love.
She always told me the story of her coming home from the hospital and my dad
saying, +IBw-Where+IBk-s my kid? I want that kid in my life.+IB0- She+IBk-d say to me, +IBw-Don+IBk-t ever
forget: He chose you.+IB0- And, ultimately, when I turned twenty-four, it was my mom
who made me track him down.
     Because my father is so private, finding him was hard work. We didn+IBk-t have
an address. He wasn+IBk-t in the phone book. I started by reaching out to some of his
old connections, German expats in Johannesburg, a woman who used to date one
of his friends who knew somebody who knew the last place he stayed. I got
nowhere. Finally my mom suggested the Swiss embassy. +IBw-They have to know
where he is,+IB0- she said, +IBw-because he has to be in touch with them.+IB0-
     I wrote to the Swiss embassy asking them where my father was, but because
my father is not on my birth certificate I had no proof that my father is my father.
The embassy wrote back and said they couldn+IBk-t give me any information, because
they didn+IBk-t know who I was. I tried calling them, and I got the runaround there as
well. +IBw-Look, kid,+IB0- they said. +IBw-We can+IBk-t help you. We+IBk-re the Swiss embassy. Do you
know nothing about the Swiss? Discretion is kind of our thing. That+IBk-s what we do.
Tough luck.+IB0- I kept pestering them and finally they said, +IBw-Okay, we+IBk-ll take your
letter and, if a man such as you+IBk-re describing exists, we might forward your letter
to him. If he doesn+IBk-t, maybe we won+IBk-t. Let+IBk-s see what happens.+IB0-
    A few months later, a letter came back in the post: +IBw-Great to hear from you.
How are you? Love, Dad.+IB0- He gave me his address in Cape Town, in a
neighborhood called Camps Bay, and a few months later I went down to visit.
      I+IBk-ll never forget that day. It was probably one of the weirdest days of my life,
going to meet a person I knew and yet did not know at all. My memories of him
felt just out of reach. I was trying to remember how he spoke, how he laughed,
what his manner was. I parked on his street and started looking for his address.
Camps Bay is full of older, semiretired white people, and as I walked down the
road all these old white men were walking toward me and past me. My father was
pushing seventy by that point, and I was so afraid I+IBk-d forgotten what he looked
like. I was looking in the face of every old white man who passed me, like, Are you
my daddy? Basically it looked like I was cruising old white dudes in a beachfront
retirement community. Then finally I got to the address I+IBk-d been given and rang
the bell, and the second he opened the door I recognized him. Hey+ACE- It+IBk-s you, I
thought. Of course it+IBk-s you. You+IBk-re the guy. I know you.
     We picked up right where we+IBk-d left off, which was him treating me exactly the
way he+IBk-d treated me as a thirteen-year-old boy. Like the creature of habit he was,
my father went straight back into it. +IBw-Right+ACE- So where were we? Here, I+IBk-ve got all
your favorites. Potato R+APY-sti. A bottle of Sprite. Custard with caramel.+IB0- Luckily my
tastes hadn+IBk-t matured much since the age of thirteen, so I tucked right in.
     While I was eating he got up and went and picked up this book, an oversized
photo album, and brought it back to the table. +IBw-I+IBk-ve been following you,+IB0- he said,
and he opened it up. It was a scrapbook of everything I had ever done, every time
my name was mentioned in a newspaper, everything from magazine covers to the
tiniest club listings, from the beginning of my career all the way through to that
week. He was smiling so big as he took me through it, looking at the headlines.
+IBw-Trevor Noah Appearing This Saturday at the Blues Room.+IB0- +IBw-Trevor Noah Hosting
New TV Show.+IB0-
     I felt a flood of emotions rushing through me. It was everything I could do not
to start crying. It felt like this ten-year gap in my life closed right up in an instant,
like only a day had passed since I+IBk-d last seen him. For years I+IBk-d had so many
questions. Is he thinking about me? Does he know what I+IBk-m doing? Is he proud of
me? But he+IBk-d been with me the whole time. He+IBk-d always been proud of me.
Circumstance had pulled us apart, but he was never not my father.
     I walked out of his house that day an inch taller. Seeing him had reaffirmed
his choosing of me. He chose to have me in his life. He chose to answer my letter. I
was wanted. Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human
being.
     Once we reconnected, I was overcome by this drive to make up for all the
years we+IBk-d missed. I decided the best way to do it was to interview him. I realized
very quickly that that was a mistake. Interviews will give you facts and
information, but facts and information weren+IBk-t really what I was after. What I
wanted was a relationship, and an interview is not a relationship. Relationships
are built in the silences. You spend time with people, you observe them and
interact with them, and you come to know them+IBQ-and that is what apartheid stole
from us: time. You can+IBk-t make up for that with an interview, but I had to figure
that out for myself.
    I went down to spend a few days with my father, and I made it my mission:
This weekend I will get to know my father. As soon as I arrived I started peppering
him with questions. +IBw-Where are you from? Where did you go to school? Why did
you do this? How did you do that?+IB0- He started getting visibly irritated.
    +IBw-What is this?+IB0- he said. +IBw-Why are you interrogating me? What+IBk-s going on
here?+IB0-
    +IBw-I want to get to know you.+IB0-
    +IBw-Is this how you normally get to know people, by interrogating them?+IB0-
    +IBw-Well+ICY-not really.+IB0-
    +IBw-So how do you get to know people?+IB0-
    +IBw-I dunno. By spending time with them, I guess.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay. So spend time with me. See what you find out.+IB0-
     So we spent the weekend together. We had dinner and talked about politics.
We watched F1 racing and talked about sports. We sat quietly in his backyard and
listened to old Elvis Presley records. The whole time he said not one word about
himself. Then, as I was packing up to leave, he walked over to me and sat down.
     +IBw-So,+IB0- he said, +IBw-in the time we+IBk-ve spent together, what would you say you+IBk-ve
learned about your dad?+IB0-
    +IBw-Nothing. All I know is that you+IBk-re extremely secretive.+IB0-
    +IBw-You see? You+IBk-re getting to know me already.+IB0-
W hen Dutch colonists landed at the southern tip of Africa over three hundred years ago,
they encountered an indigenous people known as the Khoisan. The Khoisan are the Native
Americans of South Africa, a lost tribe of bushmen, nomadic hunter-gatherers distinct from
the darker, Bantu-speaking peoples who later migrated south to become the Zulu, Xhosa, and
Sotho tribes of modern South Africa. While settling in Cape Town and the surrounding
frontier, the white colonists had their way with the Khoisan women, and the first mixed
people of South Africa were born.
    To work the colonists+IBk- farms, slaves were soon imported from different corners of the
Dutch empire, from West Africa, Madagascar, and the East Indies. The slaves and the Khoisan
intermarried, and the white colonists continued to dip in and take their liberties, and over
time the Khoisan all but disappeared from South Africa. While most were killed off through
disease, famine, and war, the rest of their bloodline was bred out of existence, mixed in with
the descendants of whites and slaves to form an entirely new race of people: coloreds. Colored
people are a hybrid, a complete mix. Some are light and some are dark. Some have Asian
features, some have white features, some have black features. It+IBk-s not uncommon for a colored
man and a colored woman to have a child that looks nothing like either parent.
    The curse that colored people carry is having no clearly defined heritage to go back to. If
they trace their lineage back far enough, at a certain point it splits into white and native and a
tangled web of +IBw-other.+IB0- Since their native mothers are gone, their strongest affinity has always
been with their white fathers, the Afrikaners. Most colored people don+IBk-t speak African
languages. They speak Afrikaans. Their religion, their institutions, all of the things that
shaped their culture came from Afrikaners.
    The history of colored people in South Africa is, in this respect, worse than the history of
black people in South Africa. For all that black people have suffered, they know who they are.
Colored people don+IBk-t.
                                              THE MULBERRY TREE



At the end of our street in Eden Park, right in a bend at the top of the road, stood a
giant mulberry tree growing out of someone+IBk-s front yard. Every year when it bore
fruit the neighborhood kids would go and pick berries from it, eating as many as
they could and filling up bags to take home. They would all play under the tree
together. I had to play under the tree by myself. I didn+IBk-t have any friends in Eden
Park.
     I was the anomaly wherever we lived. In Hillbrow, we lived in a white area,
and nobody looked like me. In Soweto, we lived in a black area, and nobody
looked like me. Eden Park was a colored area. In Eden Park, everyone looked like
me, but we couldn+IBk-t have been more different. It was the biggest mindfuck I+IBk-ve
ever experienced.
     The animosity I felt from the colored people I encountered growing up was
one of the hardest things I+IBk-ve ever had to deal with. It taught me that it is easier to
be an insider as an outsider than to be an outsider as an insider. If a white guy
chooses to immerse himself in hip-hop culture and only hang out with black
people, black people will say, +IBw-Cool, white guy. Do what you need to do.+IB0- If a black
guy chooses to button up his blackness to live among white people and play lots of
golf, white people will say, +IBw-Fine. I like Brian. He+IBk-s safe.+IB0- But try being a black
person who immerses himself in white culture while still living in the black
community. Try being a white person who adopts the trappings of black culture
while still living in the white community. You will face more hate and ridicule and
ostracism than you can even begin to fathom. People are willing to accept you if
they see you as an outsider trying to assimilate into their world. But when they see
you as a fellow tribe member attempting to disavow the tribe, that is something
they will never forgive. That is what happened to me in Eden Park.
                                          +IBQ-
When apartheid came, colored people defied easy categorization, so the system
used them+IBQ-quite brilliantly+IBQ-to sow confusion, hatred, and mistrust. For the
purposes of the state, colored people became the almost-whites. They were
second-class citizens, denied the rights of white people but given special privileges
that black people didn+IBk-t have, just to keep them holding out for more. Afrikaners
used to call them amperbaas: +IBw-the almost-boss.+IB0- The almost-master. +IBw-You+IBk-re
almost there. You+IBk-re so close. You+IBk-re this close to being white. Pity your
grandfather couldn+IBk-t keep his hands off the chocolate, eh? But it+IBk-s not your fault
you+IBk-re colored, so keep trying. Because if you work hard enough you can erase this
taint from your bloodline. Keep on marrying lighter and whiter and don+IBk-t touch
the chocolate and maybe, maybe, someday, if you+IBk-re lucky, you can become
white.+IB0-
     Which seems ridiculous, but it would happen. Every year under apartheid,
some colored people would get promoted to white. It wasn+IBk-t a myth+ADs- it was real.
People could submit applications to the government. Your hair might become
straight enough, your skin might become light enough, your accent might become
polished enough+IBQ-and you+IBk-d be reclassified as white. All you had to do was
denounce your people, denounce your history, and leave your darker-skinned
friends and family behind.
     The legal definition of a white person under apartheid was +IBw-one who in
appearance is obviously a white person who is generally not accepted as a
coloured person+ADs- or is generally accepted as a white person and is not in
appearance obviously a white person.+IB0- It was completely arbitrary, in other words.
That+IBk-s where the government came up with things like the pencil test. If you were
applying to be white, the pencil went into your hair. If it fell out, you were white. If
it stayed in, you were colored. You were what the government said you were.
Sometimes that came down to a lone clerk eyeballing your face and making a snap
decision. Depending on how high your cheekbones were or how broad your nose
was, he could tick whatever box made sense to him, thereby deciding where you
could live, whom you could marry, what jobs and rights and privileges you were
allowed.
     And colored people didn+IBk-t just get promoted to white. Sometimes colored
people became Indian. Sometimes Indian people became colored. Sometimes
blacks were promoted to colored, and sometimes coloreds were demoted to black.
And of course whites could be demoted to colored as well. That was key. Those
mixed bloodlines were always lurking, waiting to peek out, and fear of losing their
status kept white people in line. If two white parents had a child and the
government decided that child was too dark, even if both parents produced
documentation proving they were white, the child could be classified as colored,
and the family had to make a decision. Do they give up their white status to go and
live as colored people in a colored area? Or would they split up, the mother taking
the colored child to live in the ghetto while the father stayed white to make a living
to support them?
     Many colored people lived in this limbo, a true purgatory, always yearning for
the white fathers who disowned them, and they could be horribly racist to one
another as a result. The most common colored slur was boesman. +IBw-Bushman.+IB0-
+IBw-Bushie.+IB0- Because it called out their blackness, their primitiveness. The worst way
to insult a colored person was to infer that they were in some way black. One of
the most sinister things about apartheid was that it taught colored people that it
was black people who were holding them back. Apartheid said that the only reason
colored people couldn+IBk-t have first-class status was because black people might use
coloredness to sneak past the gates to enjoy the benefits of whiteness.
      That+IBk-s what apartheid did: It convinced every group that it was because of the
other race that they didn+IBk-t get into the club. It+IBk-s basically the bouncer at the door
telling you, +IBw-We can+IBk-t let you in because of your friend Darren and his ugly shoes.+IB0-
So you look at Darren and say, +IBw-Screw you, Black Darren. You+IBk-re holding me
back.+IB0- Then when Darren goes up, the bouncer says, +IBw-No, it+IBk-s actually your friend
Sizwe and his weird hair.+IB0- So Darren says, +IBw-Screw you, Sizwe,+IB0- and now everyone
hates everyone. But the truth is that none of you were ever getting into that club.
     Colored people had it rough. Imagine: You+IBk-ve been brainwashed into
believing that your blood is tainted. You+IBk-ve spent all your time assimilating and
aspiring to whiteness. Then, just as you think you+IBk-re closing in on the finish line,
some fucking guy named Nelson Mandela comes along and flips the country on its
head. Now the finish line is back where the starting line was, and the benchmark is
black. Black is in charge. Black is beautiful. Black is powerful. For centuries
colored people were told: Blacks are monkeys. Don+IBk-t swing from the trees like
them. Learn to walk upright like the white man. Then all of a sudden it+IBk-s Planet of
the Apes, and the monkeys have taken over.
                                         +IBQ-
So you can imagine how weird it was for me. I was mixed but not colored+IBQ-colored
by complexion but not by culture. Because of that I was seen as a colored person
who didn+IBk-t want to be colored.
     In Eden Park, I encountered two types of colored people. Some colored
people hated me because of my blackness. My hair was curly and I was proud of
my Afro. I spoke African languages and loved speaking them. People would hear
me speaking Xhosa or Zulu and they+IBk-d say, +IBw-Wat is jy? +IBk-n Boesman?+IB0- +IBw-What are
you, a Bushman?+IB0- Why are you trying to be black? Why do you speak that click-
click language? Look at your light skin. You+IBk-re almost there and you+IBk-re throwing it
away.
      Other colored people hated me because of my whiteness. Even though I
identified as being black, I had a white father. I went to an English private school.
I+IBk-d learned to get along with white people at church. I could speak perfect English,
and I barely spoke Afrikaans, the language colored people were supposed to speak.
So colored people thought that I thought I was better than them. They would
mock my accent, like I was putting on airs. +IBw-Dink jy, jy is gr+AOo-nd?+IB0- +IBw-You think
you+IBk-re high class?+IB0gFA-uppity, people would say in America.
    Even when I thought I was liked, I wasn+IBk-t. One year I got a brand-new bike
during the summer holidays. My cousin Mlungisi and I were taking turns riding
around the block. I was riding up our street when this cute colored girl came out to
the road and stopped me. She smiled and waved to me sweetly.
    +IBw-Hey,+IB0- she said, +IBw-can I ride your bike?+IB0-
    I was completely shocked. Oh, wow, I thought, I made a friend.
    +IBw-Yeah, of course,+IB0- I said.
     I got off and she got on and rode about twenty or thirty feet. Some random
older kid came running up to the street, she stopped and got off, and he climbed
on and rode away. I was so happy that a girl had spoken to me that it didn+IBk-t fully
sink in that they+IBk-d stolen my bicycle. I ran back home, smiling and skipping along.
My cousin asked where the bicycle was. I told him.
    +IBw-Trevor, you+IBk-ve been robbed,+IB0- he said. +IBw-Why didn+IBk-t you chase them?+IB0-
    +IBw-I thought they were being nice. I thought I+IBk-d made a friend.+IB0-
   Mlungisi was older, my protector. He ran off and found the kids, and thirty
minutes later he came back with my bike.
     Things like that happened a lot. I was bullied all the time. The incident at the
mulberry tree was probably the worst of them. Late one afternoon I was playing by
myself like I always did, running around the neighborhood. This group of five or
six colored boys was up the street picking berries off the mulberry tree and eating
them. I went over and started picking some to take home for myself. The boys
were a few years older than me, around twelve or thirteen. They didn+IBk-t talk to me,
and I didn+IBk-t talk to them. They were speaking to one another in Afrikaans, and I
could understand what they were saying. Then one of them, this kid who was the
ringleader of the group, walked over. +IBw-Mag ek jou moerbeie sien?+IB0- +IBw-Can I see your
mulberries?+IB0- My first thought, again, was, Oh, cool. I made a friend. I held up my
hand and showed him my mulberries. Then he knocked them out of my hand and
smushed them into the ground. The other kids started laughing. I stood there and
looked at him a moment. By that point I+IBk-d developed thick skin. I was used to
being bullied. I shrugged it off and went back to picking berries.
     Clearly not getting the reaction he wanted, this kid started cursing me out.
+IBw-Fok weg, jou onnosele Boesman+ACEgHQ- +IBw-Get the fuck out of here+ACE- Go away, you stupid
Bushie+ACE- Bushman+ACEgHQ- I ignored him and went on about my business. Then I felt a
splat+ACE- on the back of my head. He+IBk-d hit me with a mulberry. It wasn+IBk-t painful, just
startling. I turned to look at him and, splat+ACE-, he hit me again, right in my face.
     Then, in a split second, before I could even react, all of these kids started
pelting me with berries, pelting the shit out of me. Some of the berries weren+IBk-t
ripe, and they stung like rocks. I tried to cover my face with my hands, but there
was a barrage coming at me from all sides. They were laughing and pelting me and
calling me names. +IBw-Bushie+ACE- Bushman+ACEgHQ- I was terrified. Just the suddenness of it, I
didn+IBk-t know what to do. I started crying, and I ran. I ran for my life, all the way
back down the road to our house.
    When I ran inside I looked like I+IBk-d been beaten to a pulp because I was
bawling my eyes out and was covered in red-purple berry juice. My mother looked
at me, horrified.
    +IBw-What happened?+IB0-
     In between sobs I told her the story. +IBw-These kids+ICY-the mulberry tree+ICY-they
threw berries at me+ICYgHQ- When I finished, she burst out laughing. +IBw-It+IBk-s not funny+ACEgHQ- I
said.
    +IBw-No, no, Trevor,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I+IBk-m not laughing because it+IBk-s funny. I+IBk-m laughing
out of relief. I thought you+IBk-d been beaten up. I thought this was blood. I+IBk-m
laughing because it+IBk-s only berry juice.+IB0-
    My mom thought everything was funny. There was no subject too dark or too
painful for her to tackle with humor. +IBw-Look on the bright side,+IB0- she said, laughing
and pointing to the half of me covered in dark berry juice. +IBw-Now you really are half
black and half white.+IB0-
    +IBw-It+IBk-s not funny+ACEgHQ-
   +IBw-Trevor, you+IBk-re okay,+IB0- she said. +IBw-Go and wash up. You+IBk-re not hurt. You+IBk-re hurt
emotionally. But you+IBk-re not hurt.+IB0-
     Half an hour later, Abel showed up. At that point Abel was still my mom+IBk-s
boyfriend. He wasn+IBk-t trying to be my father or even a stepfather, really. He was
more like a big brother than anything. He+IBk-d joke around with me, have fun. I
didn+IBk-t know him that well, but one thing I did know about him was that he had a
temper. Very charming when he wanted to be, incredibly funny, but fuck he could
be mean. He+IBk-d grown up in the homelands, where you had to fight to survive. Abel
was big, too, around six-foot-three, long and lean. He hadn+IBk-t hit my mom yet. He
hadn+IBk-t hit me yet, either. But I knew he was dangerous. I+IBk-d seen it. Someone would
cut us off in traffic. Abel would yell out the window. The other guy would honk and
yell back. In a flash Abel would be out of our car, over to theirs, grabbing the guy
through the driver+IBk-s-side window, screaming in his face, raising a fist. You+IBk-d see
the other guy panic. +IBw-Whoa, whoa, whoa. I+IBk-m sorry, I+IBk-m sorry.+IB0-
    When Abel walked in that night, he sat down on the couch and saw that I+IBk-d
been crying.
    +IBw-What happened?+IB0- he said.
    I started to explain. My mother cut me off. +IBw-Don+IBk-t tell him,+IB0- she said. She
knew what would happen. She knew better than me.
    +IBw-Don+IBk-t tell me what?+IB0- Abel said.
    +IBw-It+IBk-s nothing,+IB0- she said.
    +IBw-It+IBk-s not nothing,+IB0- I said.
    She glared at me. +IBw-Don+IBk-t tell him.+IB0-
    Abel was getting frustrated. +IBw-What? Don+IBk-t tell me what?+IB0-
      He+IBk-d been drinking+ADs- he never came home from work sober, and the drinking
always made his temper worse. It was strange, but in that moment I realized that
if I said the right things I could get him to step in and do something. We were
almost family, and I knew if I made him feel like his family had been insulted, he+IBk-d
help me get back at the boys. I knew he had a demon inside him, and I hated that+ADs-
it terrified me how violent and dangerous he was when he snapped. But in that
moment I knew exactly what I had to say to get the monster on my side.
     I told him the story, the names they called me, the way they attacked me. My
mother kept laughing it off, telling me to get over it, that it was kids being kids, no
big deal. She was trying to defuse the situation, but I couldn+IBk-t see that. I was just
mad at her. +IBw-You think it+IBk-s a joke, but it+IBk-s not funny+ACE- It+IBk-s not funny+ACEgHQ-
    Abel wasn+IBk-t laughing. As I told him what the bullies had done, I could see the
anger building up inside him. With Abel+IBk-s anger, there was no ranting and raving,
no clenched fists. He sat there on the couch listening to me, not saying a word.
Then, very calm and deliberate, he stood up.
    +IBw-Take me to these boys,+IB0- he said.
    Yes, I thought, this is it. Big brother is going to get my revenge for me.
     We got into his car and drove up the road, stopping a few houses down from
the tree. It was dark now except for the light from the streetlamps, but we could
see the boys were still there, playing under the tree. I pointed to the ringleader.
+IBw-That one. He was the main one.+IB0- Abel slammed his foot on the gas and shot up
onto the grass and straight toward the bottom of the tree. He jumped out. I
jumped out. As soon as the kids saw me they knew exactly what was happening.
They scattered and ran like hell.
    Abel was quick. Good Lord, he was fast. The ringleader had made a dash for it
and was trying to climb over a wall. Abel grabbed him, pulled him down, and
dragged him back. Then he stripped a branch off the tree, a switch, and started
whipping him. He whipped the shit out of him, and I loved it. I have never enjoyed
anything as much as I enjoyed that moment. Revenge truly is sweet. It takes you to
a dark place, but, man, it satisfies a thirst.
     Then there was the strangest moment where it flipped. I caught a glimpse of
the look of terror in the boy+IBk-s face, and I realized that Abel had gone past getting
revenge for me. He wasn+IBk-t doing this to teach the kid a lesson. He was just beating
him. He was a grown man venting his rage on a twelve-year-old boy. In an instant
I went from Yes, I got my revenge to No, no, no. Too much. Too much. Oh shit. Oh
shit. Oh shit. Dear God, what have I done?
    Once this kid was beat to shit, Abel dragged him over to the car and held him
up in front of me. +IBw-Say you+IBk-re sorry.+IB0- The kid was whimpering, trembling. He
looked me in the eye, and I had never seen fear in someone+IBk-s eyes like I saw in his.
He+IBk-d been beaten by a stranger in a way I don+IBk-t think he+IBk-d ever been beaten before.
He said he was sorry, but it was like his apology wasn+IBk-t for what he+IBk-d done to me.
It was like he was sorry for every bad thing he+IBk-d ever done in his life, because he
didn+IBk-t know there could be a punishment like this.
     Looking in that boy+IBk-s eyes, I realized how much he and I had in common. He
was a kid. I was a kid. He was crying. I was crying. He was a colored boy in South
Africa, taught how to hate and how to hate himself. Who had bullied him that he
needed to bully me? He+IBk-d made me feel fear, and to get my revenge I+IBk-d unleashed
my own hell on his world. But I knew I+IBk-d done a terrible thing.
     Once the kid apologized, Abel shoved him away and kicked him. +IBw-Go.+IB0- The kid
ran off, and we drove back to the house in silence. At home Abel and my mom got
in a huge fight. She was always on him about his temper. +IBw-You can+IBk-t go around
hitting other people+IBk-s children+ACE- You+IBk-re not the law+ACE- This anger, this is no way to
live+ACEgHQ-
     A couple of hours later this kid+IBk-s dad drove over to our house to confront
Abel. Abel went out to the gate, and I watched from inside the house. By that point
Abel was truly drunk. This kid+IBk-s dad had no idea what he was walking into. He was
some mild-mannered, middle-aged guy. I don+IBk-t remember much about him,
because I was watching Abel the whole time. I never took my eyes off him. I knew
that+IBk-s where the danger was.
     Abel didn+IBk-t have a gun yet+ADs- he bought that later. But Abel didn+IBk-t need a gun to
put the fear of God in you. I watched as he got right in this guy+IBk-s face. I couldn+IBk-t
hear what the other man was saying, but I heard Abel. +IBw-Don+IBk-t fuck with me. I will
kill you.+IB0- The guy turned quickly and got back in his car and drove away. He
thought he was coming to defend the honor of his family. He left happy to escape
with his life.
W hen I was growing up, my mom spent a lot of time trying to teach me about women. She
was always giving me lessons, little talks, pieces of advice. It was never a full-blown, sit-down
lecture about relationships. It was more like tidbits along the way. And I never understood
why, because I was a kid. The only women in my life were my mom and my grandmother and
my aunt and my cousin. I had no love interest whatsoever, yet my mom insisted. She would go
off on a whole range of things.
    +IBw-Trevor, remember a man is not determined by how much he earns. You can still be the
man of the house and earn less than your woman. Being a man is not what you have, it+IBk-s who
you are. Being more of a man doesn+IBk-t mean your woman has to be less than you.+IB0-
   +IBw-Trevor, make sure your woman is the woman in your life. Don+IBk-t be one of these men who
makes his wife compete with his mother. A man with a wife cannot be beholden to his
mother.+IB0-
    The smallest thing could prompt her. I+IBk-d walk through the house on the way to my room
and say, +IBw-Hey, Mom+IB0- without glancing up. She+IBk-d say, +IBw-No, Trevor+ACE- You look at me. You
acknowledge me. Show me that I exist to you, because the way you treat me is the way you will
treat your woman. Women like to be noticed. Come and acknowledge me and let me know that
you see me. Don+IBk-t just see me when you need something.+IB0-
    These little lessons were always about grown-up relationships, funnily enough. She was so
preoccupied with teaching me how to be a man that she never taught me how to be a boy. How
to talk to a girl or pass a girl a note in class+IBQ-there was none of that. She only told me about
adult things. She would even lecture me about sex. As I was a kid, that would get very
awkward.
    +IBw-Trevor, don+IBk-t forget: You+IBk-re having sex with a woman in her mind before you+IBk-re having
sex with her in her vagina.+IB0-
    +IBw-Trevor, foreplay begins during the day. It doesn+IBk-t begin in the bedroom.+IB0-
    I+IBk-d be like, +IBw-What? What is foreplay? What does that even mean?+IB0-
        A YOUNG MAN+IBk-S LONG, AWKWARD,
  OCCASIONALLY TRAGIC, AND FREQUENTLY
    HUMILIATING EDUCATION IN AFFAIRS OF
      THE HEART, PART I: VALENTINE+IBk-S DAY



It was my first year at H. A. Jack, the primary school I transferred to after leaving
Maryvale. Valentine+IBk-s Day was approaching fast. I was twelve years old, and I+IBk-d
never done Valentine+IBk-s Day before. We didn+IBk-t celebrate it in Catholic school. I
understood Valentine+IBk-s Day, as a concept. The naked baby shoots you with an
arrow and you fall in love. I got that part. But this was my first time being
introduced to it as an activity. At H. A. Jack, Valentine+IBk-s Day was used as a
fundraiser. Pupils were going around selling flowers and cards, and I had to go ask
a friend what was happening.
    +IBw-What is this?+IB0- I said. +IBw-What are we doing?+IB0-
    +IBw-Oh, you know,+IB0- she said, +IBw-it+IBk-s Valentine+IBk-s Day. You pick a special person and
you tell them that you love them, and they love you back.+IB0-
     Wow, I thought, that seems intense. But I hadn+IBk-t been shot by Cupid+IBk-s arrow,
and I didn+IBk-t know of anyone getting shot on my behalf. I had no clue what was
going on. All week, the girls in school kept saying, +IBw-Who+IBk-s your valentine? Who+IBk-s
your valentine?+IB0- I didn+IBk-t know what I was supposed to do. Finally one of the girls,
a white girl, said, +IBw-You should ask Maylene.+IB0- The other kids agreed. +IBw-Yes, Maylene.
You should definitely ask Maylene. You have to ask Maylene. You guys are perfect
for each other.+IB0-
    Maylene was a girl I used to walk home from school with. We lived in the city
now, me, my mom and Abel, who was now my stepfather, and my new baby
brother, Andrew. We+IBk-d sold our house in Eden Park to invest in Abel+IBk-s new garage.
Then that fell apart, and we ended up moving to a neighborhood called Highlands
North, a thirty-minute walk from H. A. Jack. A group of us would leave school
together every afternoon, each kid peeling off and going their separate way when
we reached their house. Maylene and I lived the farthest, so we+IBk-d always be the last
two. We+IBk-d walk together until we got where we needed to go, and then we+IBk-d part
ways.
    Maylene was cool. She was good at tennis, smart, cute. I liked her. I didn+IBk-t
have a crush on her+ADs- I wasn+IBk-t even thinking about girls that way yet. I just liked
hanging out with her. Maylene was also the only colored girl in school. I was the
only mixed kid in school. We were the only two people who looked like each other.
The white girls were insistent about me asking Maylene to be my valentine. They
were like, +IBw-Trevor, you have to ask her. You+IBk-re the only two. It+IBk-s your
responsibility.+IB0- It was like our species was going to die out if we didn+IBk-t mate and
carry on. Which I+IBk-ve learned in life is something that white people do without even
realizing it. +IBw-You two look the same, therefore we must arrange for you to have
sex.+IB0-
     I honestly hadn+IBk-t thought of asking Maylene, but when the girls brought it up,
that thing happened where someone plants the idea in your head and it changes
your perception.
    +IBw-Maylene+IBk-s totally got a thing for you.+IB0-
    +IBw-Does she?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, you guys are great together+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Are we?+IB0-
    +IBw-Totally.+IB0-
    +IBw-Well, okay. If you say so.+IB0-
     I liked Maylene as much as I liked anyone, I suppose. Mostly I think I liked
the idea of being liked. I decided I+IBk-d ask her to be my valentine, but I had no idea
how to do it. I didn+IBk-t know the first thing about having a girlfriend. I had to be
taught the whole love bureaucracy of the school. There was the thing where you
don+IBk-t actually talk straight to the person. You have your group of friends and she
has her group of friends, and your group of friends has to go to her group of
friends and say, +IBw-Okay, Trevor likes Maylene. He wants her to be his valentine.
We+IBk-re in favor. We+IBk-re ready to sign off with your approval.+IB0- Her friends say, +IBw-Okay.
Sounds good. We have to run it by Maylene.+IB0- They go to Maylene. They consult.
They tell her what they think. +IBw-Trevor says he likes you. We+IBk-re in favor. We think
you+IBk-d be good together. What do you say?+IB0- Maylene says, +IBw-I like Trevor.+IB0- They say,
+IBw-Okay. Let+IBk-s move forward.+IB0- They come back to us. +IBw-Maylene says she approves
and she+IBk-s waiting for Trevor+IBk-s Valentine+IBk-s Day advance.+IB0-
     The girls told me this process was what needed to happen. I said, +IBw-Cool. Let+IBk-s
do it.+IB0- The friends sorted it out, Maylene got on board, and I was all set.
      The week before Valentine+IBk-s, Maylene and I were walking home together, and
I was trying to get up the courage to ask her. I was so nervous. I+IBk-d never done
anything like it. I already knew the answer+ADs- her friends had told me she+IBk-d say yes.
It+IBk-s like being in Congress. You know you have the votes before you go to the floor,
but it+IBk-s still difficult because anything could happen. I didn+IBk-t know how to do it, all
I knew was I wanted it to be perfect, so I waited until we were standing outside
McDonald+IBk-s. Then I mustered up all of my courage and turned to her.
    +IBw-Hey, Valentine+IBk-s Day is coming up, and I was wondering, would you be my
valentine?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes. I+IBk-ll be your valentine.+IB0-
     And then, under the golden arches, we kissed. It was my first time ever
kissing a girl. It was just a peck, our lips touched for only a few seconds, but it set
off explosions in my head. Yes+ACE- Oh, yes. This. I don+IBk-t know what this is, but I like
it. Something had awakened. And it was right outside McDonald+IBk-s, so it was extra
special.
     Now I was truly excited. I had a valentine. I had a girlfriend. I spent the whole
week thinking about Maylene, wanting to make her Valentine+IBk-s Day as memorable
as I could. I saved up my pocket money and bought her flowers and a teddy bear
and a card. I wrote a poem with her name in the card, which was really hard
because there aren+IBk-t many good words that rhyme with Maylene. (Machine?
Ravine? Sardine?) Then the big day came. I got my Valentine+IBk-s card and the
flowers and the teddy bear and got them ready and took them to school. I was the
happiest boy on earth.
     The teachers had set aside a period before recess for everyone to exchange
valentines. There was a corridor outside our classrooms where I knew Maylene
would be, and I waited for her there. All around me, love was in bloom. Boys and
girls exchanging cards and gifts, laughing and giggling and stealing kisses. I
waited and waited. Finally Maylene showed up and walked over to me. I was about
to say +IBw-Happy Valentine+IBk-s Day+ACEgHQ- when she stopped me and said, +IBw-Oh, hi, Trevor.
Um, listen, I can+IBk-t be your girlfriend anymore. Lorenzo asked me to be his
valentine and I can+IBk-t have two valentines, so I+IBk-m his girlfriend now and not yours.+IB0-
     She said it so matter-of-factly that I had no idea how to process it. This was
my first time having a girlfriend, so at first I thought, Huh, maybe this is just how
it goes.
    +IBw-Oh, okay,+IB0- I said. +IBw-Well, um+ICY-happy Valentine+IBk-s Day.+IB0-
     I held out the card and the flowers and the teddy bear. She took them and
said thanks, and she was gone.
    I felt like someone had taken a gun and shot holes in every part of me. But at
the same time some part of me said, +IBw-Well, this makes sense.+IB0- Lorenzo was
everything I wasn+IBk-t. He was popular. He was white. He+IBk-d upset the balance of
everything by asking out the only colored girl in school. Girls loved him, and he
was dumb as rocks. A nice guy, but kind of a bad boy. Girls did his homework for
him+ADs- he was that guy. He was really good-looking, too. It was like when he was
creating his character he traded in all his intelligence points for beauty points. I
stood no chance.
     As devastated as I was, I understood why Maylene made the choice that she
did. I would have picked Lorenzo over me, too. All the other kids were running up
and down the corridors and out on the playground, laughing and smiling with
their red and pink cards and flowers, and I went back to the classroom and sat by
myself and waited for the bell to ring.
P etrol for the car, like food, was an expense we could not avoid, but my mom could get more
mileage out of a tank of petrol than any human who has ever been on a road in the history of
automobiles. She knew every trick. Driving around Johannesburg in our rusty old
Volkswagen, every time she stopped in traffic, she+IBk-d turn off the car. Then the traffic would
start and she+IBk-d turn the car on again. That stop-start technology that they use in hybrid cars
now? That was my mom. She was a hybrid car before hybrid cars came out. She was the
master of coasting. She knew every downhill between work and school, between school and
home. She knew exactly where the gradient shifted to put it into neutral. She could time the
traffic lights so we could coast through intersections without using the brakes or losing
momentum.
    There were times when we would be in traffic and we had so little money for petrol that I
would have to push the car. If we were stuck in gridlock, my mom would turn the car off and it
was my job to get out and push it forward six inches at a time. People would pitch up and offer
to help.
   +IBw-Are you stuck?+IB0-
   +IBw-Nope. We+IBk-re fine.+IB0-
   +IBw-You sure?+IB0-
   +IBw-Yep.+IB0-
   +IBw-Can we help you?+IB0-
   +IBw-Nope.+IB0-
   +IBw-Do you need a tow?+IB0-
   And what do you say? The truth? +IBw-Thanks, but we+IBk-re just so poor my mom makes her kid
push the car+IB0-?
     That was some of the most embarrassing shit in my life, pushing the car to school like the
fucking Flintstones. Because the other kids were coming in on that same road to go to school.
I+IBk-d take my blazer off so that no one could tell what school I went to, and I would bury my head
and push the car, hoping no one would recognize me.
                                                                OUTSIDER



After finishing primary school at H. A. Jack, I started grade eight at Sandringham
High School. Even after apartheid, most black people still lived in the townships
and the areas formerly designated as homelands, where the only available
government schools were the broken remnants of the Bantu system. Wealthy
white kids+IBQ-along with the few black people and colored people and Indians who
had money or could get scholarships+IBQ-were holed up in private schools, which
were super-expensive but virtually guaranteed entry into university. Sandringham
was what we call a Model C school, which meant it was a mix of government and
private, similar to charter schools in America. The place was huge, a thousand kids
on sprawling grounds with tennis courts, sports fields, and a swimming pool.
     Being a Model C school and not a government school, Sandringham drew kids
from all over, making it a near-perfect microcosm of post-apartheid South Africa
as a whole+IBQ-a perfect example of what South Africa has the potential to be. We had
rich white kids, a bunch of middle-class white kids, and some working-class white
kids. We had black kids who were newly rich, black kids who were middle-class,
and black kids from the townships. We had colored kids and Indian kids, and even
a handful of Chinese kids, too. The pupils were as integrated as they could be
given that apartheid had just ended. At H. A. Jack, race was broken up into blocks.
Sandringham was more like a spectrum.
     South African schools don+IBk-t have cafeterias. At Sandringham we+IBk-d buy our
lunch at what we call the tuck shop, a little canteen, and then have free rein to go
wherever we wanted on the school grounds to eat+IBQ-the quad, the courtyard, the
playground, wherever. Kids would break off and cluster into their cliques and
groups. People were still grouped by color in most cases, but you could see how
they all blended and shaded into one another. The kids who played soccer were
mostly black. The kids who played tennis were mostly white. The kids who played
cricket were a mix. The Chinese kids would hang out next to the prefab buildings.
The matrics, what South Africans call seniors, would hang out on the quad. The
popular, pretty girls would hang out over here, and computer geeks would hang
out over there. To the extent that the groupings were racial, it was because of the
ways race overlapped class and geography out in the real world. Suburban kids
hung out with suburban kids. Township kids hung out with township kids.
     At break, as the only mixed kid out of a thousand, I faced the same
predicament I had on the playground at H. A. Jack: Where was I supposed to go?
Even with so many different groups to choose from, I wasn+IBk-t a natural constituent
of any particular one. I obviously wasn+IBk-t Indian or Chinese. The colored kids
would shit on me all the time for being too black. So I wasn+IBk-t welcome there. As
always, I was adept enough with white kids not to get bullied by them, but the
white kids were always going shopping, going to the movies, going on trips+IBQ-
things that required money. We didn+IBk-t have any money, so I was out of the mix
there, too. The group I felt the most affinity for was the poor black kids. I hung out
with them and got along with them, but most of them took minibuses to school
from way out in the townships, from Soweto, from Tembisa, from Alexandra. They
rode to school as friends and went home as friends. They had their own groups.
Weekends and school holidays, they were hanging out with one another and I
couldn+IBk-t visit. Soweto was a forty-minute drive from my house. We didn+IBk-t have
money for petrol. After school I was on my own. Weekends I was on my own. Ever
the outsider, I created my own strange little world. I did it out of necessity. I
needed a way to fit in. I also needed money, a way to buy the same snacks and do
the things that the other kids were doing. Which is how I became the tuck-shop
guy.
     Thanks to my long walk to school, I was late every single day. I+IBk-d have to stop
off in the prefect+IBk-s office to write my name down for detention. I was the patron
saint of detention. Already late, I+IBk-d run to join my morning classes+IBQ-math,
English, biology, whatever. The last period before break was assembly. The pupils
would come together in the assembly hall, each grade seated row by row, and the
teachers and the prefects would get up onstage and go over the business of what
was happening in the school+IBQ-announcements, awards, that sort of thing. The
names of the kids with detention were announced at every assembly, and I was
always one of them. Always. Every single day. It was a running joke. The prefect
would say, +IBw-Detentions for today+ICYgHQ- and I would stand up automatically. It was
like the Oscars and I was Meryl Streep. There was one time I stood up and then
the prefect named the five people and I wasn+IBk-t one of them. Everyone burst out
laughing. Somebody yelled out, +IBw-Where+IBk-s Trevor?+ACEgHQ- The prefect looked at the
paper and shook his head. +IBw-Nope.+IB0- The entire hall erupted with cheers and
applause. +IBw-Yay+ACEAIQAhACEgHQ-
     Then, immediately after assembly, there would be a race to the tuck shop
because the queue to buy food was so long. Every minute you spent in the queue
was working against your break time. The sooner you got your food, the longer
you had to eat, play a game of soccer, or hang out. Also, if you got there late, the
best food was gone.
    Two things were true about me at that age. One, I was still the fastest kid in
school. And two, I had no pride. The second we were dismissed from assembly I
would run like a bat out of hell to the tuck shop so I could be the first one there. I
was always first in line. I became notorious for being that guy, so much so that
people started coming up to me in line. +IBw-Hey, can you buy this for me?+IB0- Which
would piss off the kids behind me because it was basically cutting the line. So
people started approaching me during assembly. They+IBk-d say, +IBw-Hey, I+IBk-ve got ten
rand. If you buy my food for me, I+IBk-ll give you two.+IB0- That+IBk-s when I learned: time is
money. I realized people would pay me to buy their food because I was willing to
run for it. I started telling everyone at assembly, +IBw-Place your orders. Give me a list
of what you want, give me a percentage of what you+IBk-re going to spend, and I+IBk-ll buy
your food for you.+IB0-
     I was an overnight success. Fat guys were my number-one customers. They
loved food, but couldn+IBk-t run. I had all these rich, fat white kids who were like,
+IBw-This is fantastic+ACE- My parents spoil me, I+IBk-ve got money, and now I+IBk-ve got a way I
can get food without having to work for it+IBQ-and I still get my break.+IB0- I had so many
customers I was turning kids away. I had a rule: I would take five orders a day,
high bidders only. I+IBk-d make so much that I could buy my lunch using other kids+IBk-
money and keep the lunch money my mom gave me for pocket cash. Then I could
afford to catch a bus home instead of walking or save up to buy whatever. Every
day I+IBk-d take orders, assembly would end, and I+IBk-d make my mad dash and buy
everybody+IBk-s hot dogs and Cokes and muffins. If you paid me extra you could even
tell me where you+IBk-d be and I+IBk-d deliver it to you.
    I+IBk-d found my niche. Since I belonged to no group I learned to move seamlessly
between groups. I floated. I was a chameleon, still, a cultural chameleon. I learned
how to blend. I could play sports with the jocks. I could talk computers with the
nerds. I could jump in the circle and dance with the township kids. I popped
around to everyone, working, chatting, telling jokes, making deliveries.
     I was like a weed dealer, but of food. The weed guy is always welcome at the
party. He+IBk-s not a part of the circle, but he+IBk-s invited into the circle temporarily
because of what he can offer. That+IBk-s who I was. Always an outsider. As the
outsider, you can retreat into a shell, be anonymous, be invisible. Or you can go
the other way. You protect yourself by opening up. You don+IBk-t ask to be accepted
for everything you are, just the one part of yourself that you+IBk-re willing to share. For
me it was humor. I learned that even though I didn+IBk-t belong to one group, I could
be a part of any group that was laughing. I+IBk-d drop in, pass out the snacks, tell a few
jokes. I+IBk-d perform for them. I+IBk-d catch a bit of their conversation, learn more about
their group, and then leave. I never overstayed my welcome. I wasn+IBk-t popular, but
I wasn+IBk-t an outcast. I was everywhere with everybody, and at the same time I was
all by myself.
I  don+IBk-t regret anything I+IBk-ve ever done in life, any choice that I+IBk-ve made. But I+IBk-m consumed
with regret for the things I didn+IBk-t do, the choices I didn+IBk-t make, the things I didn+IBk-t say. We
spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we
should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question
you will never have the answer to. +IBw-What if+ICYgHQ- +IBw-If only+ICYgHQ- +IBw-I wonder what would have+ICYgHQ- You
will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days.
        A YOUNG MAN+IBk-S LONG, AWKWARD,
  OCCASIONALLY TRAGIC, AND FREQUENTLY
    HUMILIATING EDUCATION IN AFFAIRS OF
           THE HEART, PART II: THE CRUSH



In high school, the attention of girls was not an affliction I suffered from. I wasn+IBk-t
the hot guy in class. I wasn+IBk-t even the cute guy in class. I was ugly. Puberty was not
kind to me. My acne was so bad that people used to ask what was wrong with me,
like I+IBk-d had an allergic reaction to something. It was the kind of acne that qualifies
as a medical condition. Acne vulgaris, the doctor called it. We+IBk-re not talking about
pimples, kids. We+IBk-re talking pustules+IBQ-big, pus-filled blackheads and whiteheads.
They started on my forehead, spread down the sides of my face, and covered my
cheeks and neck and ravaged me everywhere.
     Being poor didn+IBk-t help. Not only could I not afford a decent haircut, leaving
me with a huge, unruly Afro, but my mother also used to get angry at the fact that
I grew out of my school uniforms too fast, so to save money she started buying my
clothes three sizes too big. My blazer was too long and my pants were too baggy
and my shoes flopped around. I was a clown. And of course, Murphy+IBk-s Law, the
year my mom started buying my clothes too big was the year that I stopped
growing. So now I was never going to grow into my clown clothes and I was stuck
being a clown. The only thing I had going for me was the fact that I was tall, but
even there I was gangly and awkward-looking. Duck feet. High ass. Nothing
worked.
     After suffering my Valentine+IBk-s Day heartbreak at the hands of Maylene and
the handsome, charming Lorenzo, I learned a valuable lesson about dating. What I
learned was that cool guys get girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool
guys with their girls. I was not a cool guy+ADs- therefore I did not have girls. I
understood that formula very quickly and I knew my place. I didn+IBk-t ask girls out. I
didn+IBk-t have a girlfriend. I didn+IBk-t even try.
     For me to try to get a girl would have upset the natural order of things. Part of
my success as the tuck-shop guy was that I was welcome everywhere, and I was
welcome everywhere because I was nobody. I was the acne-ridden clown with
duck feet in floppy shoes. I wasn+IBk-t a threat to the guys. I wasn+IBk-t a threat to the
girls. The minute I became somebody, I risked no longer being welcomed as
nobody. The pretty girls were already spoken for. The popular guys had staked
their claim. They would say, +IBw-I like Zuleika,+IB0- and you knew that meant if you tried
anything with Zuleika there+IBk-d be a fight. In the interest of survival, the smart move
was to stay on the fringe, stay out of trouble.
     At Sandringham, the only time girls in class looked at me was when they
wanted me to pass a letter to the hot guy in class. But there was one girl I knew
named Johanna. Johanna and I had been at the same school intermittently our
whole lives. We were in preschool at Maryvale together. Then she left and went to
another school. Then we were in primary school at H. A. Jack together. Then she
left and went to another school. Then finally we were at Sandringham together.
Because of that we became friends.
    Johanna was one of the popular girls. Her best friend was Zaheera. Johanna
was beautiful. Zaheera was stunning. Zaheera was colored, Cape Malay. She
looked like Salma Hayek. Johanna was out and about and kissing boys, so the guys
were all into her. Zaheera, as beautiful as she was, was extremely shy, so there
weren+IBk-t as many guys after her.
     Johanna and Zaheera were always together. They were one grade below me,
but in terms of popularity they were three grades above me. Still I got to hang out
with them because I knew Johanna and we had this thing from being in different
schools together. Dating girls may have been out of the question for me, but
talking to them was not, because I could make them laugh. Human beings like to
laugh, and lucky for me pretty girls are human beings. So I could relate to them in
that way, but never in the other way. I knew this because whenever they stopped
laughing at my jokes and stories they+IBk-d say, +IBw-So how do you think I can get Daniel
to ask me out?+IB0- I always had a clear idea of where I stood.
     Outwardly, I had carefully cultivated my status as the funny, nonthreatening
guy, but secretly I had the hugest crush on Zaheera. She was so pretty and so
funny. We+IBk-d hang out and have great conversations. I thought about her
constantly, but for the life of me I never considered myself worthy of dating her. I
told myself, I+IBk-m going to have a crush on her forever, and that+IBk-s all that+IBk-s ever
going to happen.
     At a certain point I decided to map out a strategy. I decided I+IBk-d be best friends
with Zaheera and stay friends with her long enough to ask her to the matric dance,
what we call our senior prom. Mind you, we were in grade nine at this point. The
matric dance was three years away. But I decided to play the long game. I was like,
Yep, just gonna take my time. Because that+IBk-s what happens in the movies, right?
I+IBk-d seen my American high school movies. You hang around long enough as the
friendly good guy and the girl dates a bunch of handsome jerks, and then one day
she turns around and goes, +IBw-Oh, it+IBk-s you. It was always you. You+IBk-re the guy I was
supposed to be with all along.+IB0-
    That was my plan. It was foolproof.
     I hung out with Zaheera every chance I got. We+IBk-d talk about boys, which ones
she liked and which ones liked her. I+IBk-d give her advice. At one point she got set up
with this guy Gary. They started dating. Gary was in the popular group but kind of
shy and Zaheera was in the popular group but kind of shy, so his friends and her
friends set them up together, like an arranged marriage. But Zaheera didn+IBk-t like
Gary at all. She told me. We talked about everything.
     One day, I don+IBk-t know how, but I plucked up the courage to ask Zaheera for
her phone number, which was a big deal back then because it wasn+IBk-t like cellphone
numbers where everybody has everyone+IBk-s number for texting and everything. This
was the landline. To her house. Where her parents might answer. We were talking
one afternoon at school and I asked, +IBw-Can I get your phone number? Maybe I can
call you and we can talk at home sometime.+IB0- She said yes, and my mind exploded.
What???+ACEAIQAhACE- A girl is giving me her phone number???+ACEAIQAh- This is insane+ACEAIQAh- What do
I do??+ACEAIQ- I was so nervous. I+IBk-ll never forget her telling me the digits one by one as I
wrote them down, trying to keep my hand from shaking. We said goodbye and
went our separate ways to class, and I was like, Okay, Trevor. Play it cool. Don+IBk-t
call her right away. I called her that night. At seven. She+IBk-d given me her number
at two. That was me being cool. Dude, don+IBk-t call her at five. That+IBk-s too obvious.
Call her at seven.
    I phoned her house that night. Her mom answered. I said, +IBw-May I speak to
Zaheera, please?+IB0- Her mom called her, and she came to the phone and we talked.
For like an hour. After that we started talking more, at school, on the phone. I
never told her how I felt. Never made a move. Nothing. I was always too scared.
     Zaheera and Gary broke up. Then they got back together. Then they broke up.
Then they got back together. They kissed once, but she didn+IBk-t like it, so they never
kissed again. Then they broke up for real. I bided my time through it all. I watched
Popular Gary go down in flames, and I was still the good friend. Yep, the plan is
working. Matric dance, here we come. Only two and a half years to go+ICY-
     Then we had the mid-year school holidays. The day we came back, Zaheera
wasn+IBk-t at school. Then she wasn+IBk-t at school the next day. Then she wasn+IBk-t at school
the day after that. Eventually I went and tracked down Johanna on the quad.
     +IBw-Hey, where+IBk-s Zaheera?+IB0- I said. +IBw-She hasn+IBk-t been around for a while. Is she
sick?+IB0-
    +IBw-No,+IB0- she said. +IBw-Didn+IBk-t anyone tell you? She left the school. She doesn+IBk-t go
here anymore.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, she left.+IB0-
    My first thought was, Wow, okay. That+IBk-s news. I should give her a call to
catch up.
    +IBw-What school did she move to?+IB0- I asked.
    +IBw-She didn+IBk-t. Her dad got a job in America. During the break they moved there.
They+IBk-ve emigrated.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah. She+IBk-s gone. She was such a good friend, too. I+IBk-m really sad. Are you as
sad as I am?+IB0-
     +IBw-Uh+ICY-yeah,+IB0- I said, still trying to process everything. +IBw-I liked Zaheera. She was
really cool.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, she was super sad, too, because she had such a huge crush on you. She
was always waiting for you to ask her out. Okay, I gotta go to class+ACE- Bye+ACEgHQ-
     She ran off and left me standing there, stunned. She+IBk-d hit me with so much
information at once, first that Zaheera was gone, then that she had left for
America, and then that she+IBk-d liked me all along. It was like I+IBk-d been hit by three
successive waves of heartbreak, each one bigger than the last. My mind raced
through all the hours we+IBk-d spent talking on the quad, on the phone, all the times I
could have said, +IBw-Hey, Zaheera, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?+IB0- Ten words
that might have changed my life if I+IBk-d had the courage to say them. But I hadn+IBk-t,
and now she was gone.
I n every nice neighborhood there+IBk-s one white family that Does Not Give a Fuck. You know the
family I+IBk-m talking about. They don+IBk-t do their lawn, don+IBk-t paint the fence, don+IBk-t fix the roof.
Their house is shit. My mom found that house and bought it, which is how she snuck a black
family into a place as white as Highlands North.
    Most black people integrating into white suburbs were moving to places like Bramley and
Lombardy East. But for some reason my mom chose Highlands North. It was a suburban area,
lots of shopping. Working people, mostly. Not wealthy but stable and middle-class. Older
houses, but still a nice place to live. In Soweto I was the only white kid in the black township.
In Eden Park I was the only mixed kid in the colored area. In Highlands North I was the only
black kid in the white suburb+IBQ-and by +IBw-only+IB0- I mean only. In Highlands North the white never
took flight. It was a largely Jewish neighborhood, and Jewish people don+IBk-t flee. They+IBk-re done
fleeing. They+IBk-ve already fled. They get to a place, build their shul, and hold it down. Since the
white people around us weren+IBk-t leaving, there weren+IBk-t a lot of families like ours moving in
behind us.
    I didn+IBk-t make any friends in Highlands North for the longest time. I had an easier time
making friends in Eden Park, to be honest. In the suburbs, everyone lived behind walls. The
white neighborhoods of Johannesburg were built on white fear+IBQ-fear of black crime, fear of
black uprisings and reprisals+IBQ-and as a result virtually every house sits behind a six-foot wall,
and on top of that wall is electric wire. Everyone lives in a plush, fancy maximum-security
prison. There is no sitting on the front porch, no saying hi to the neighbors, no kids running
back and forth between houses. I+IBk-d ride my bike around the neighborhood for hours without
seeing a single kid. I+IBk-d hear them, though. They were all meeting up behind brick walls for
playdates I wasn+IBk-t invited to. I+IBk-d hear people laughing and playing and I+IBk-d get off my bike and
creep up and peek over the wall and see a bunch of white kids splashing around in someone+IBk-s
swimming pool. I was like a Peeping Tom, but for friendship.
     It was only after a year or so that I figured out the key to making black friends in the
suburbs: the children of domestics. Many domestic workers in South Africa, when they get
pregnant they get fired. Or, if they+IBk-re lucky, the family they work for lets them stay on and they
can have the baby, but then the baby goes to live with relatives in the homelands. Then the
black mother raises the white children, seeing her own child only once a year at the holidays.
But a handful of families would let their domestics keep their children with them, living in
little maids+IBk- quarters or flatlets in the backyard.
    For a long time, those kids were my only friends.
                                                             COLORBLIND



At Sandringham I got to know this one kid, Teddy. Funny guy, charming as hell.
My mom used to call him Bugs Bunny+ADs- he had a cheeky smile with two big teeth
that stuck out the front of his mouth. Teddy and I got along like a house on fire,
one of those friends where you start hanging out and from that day forward you+IBk-re
never apart. We were both naughty as shit, too. With Teddy, I+IBk-d finally met
someone who made me feel normal. I was the terror in my family. He was the
terror in his family. When you put us together it was mayhem. Walking home
from school we+IBk-d throw rocks through windows, just to see them shatter, and then
we+IBk-d run away. We got detention together all the time. The teachers, the pupils,
the principal, everyone at school knew: Teddy and Trevor, thick as thieves.
    Teddy+IBk-s mom worked as a domestic for a family in Linksfield, a wealthy
suburb near school. Linksfield was a long walk from my house, nearly forty
minutes, but still doable. Walking around was pretty much all I did back then,
anyway. I couldn+IBk-t afford to do anything else, and I couldn+IBk-t afford to get around
any other way. If you liked walking, you were my friend. Teddy and I walked all
over Johannesburg together. I+IBk-d walk to Teddy+IBk-s house and we+IBk-d hang out there.
Then we+IBk-d walk back to my house and hang out there. We+IBk-d walk from my house
down to the city center, which was like a three-hour hike, just to hang out, and
then we+IBk-d walk all the way back.
     Friday and Saturday nights we+IBk-d walk to the mall and hang out. The Balfour
Park Shopping Mall was a few blocks from my house. It+IBk-s not a big mall, but it has
everything+IBQ-an arcade, a cinema, restaurants, South Africa+IBk-s version of Target,
South Africa+IBk-s version of the Gap. Then, once we were at the mall, since we never
had any money to shop or watch movies or buy food, we+IBk-d just wander around
inside.
     One night we were at the mall and most of the shops were closed, but the
cinema was still showing movies so the building was still open. There was this
stationery shop that sold greeting cards and magazines, and it didn+IBk-t have a door,
so when it closed at night there was only a metal gate, like a trellis, that was pulled
across the entrance and padlocked. Walking past this shop, Teddy and I realized
that if we put our arms through the trellis we could reach this rack of chocolates
just inside. And these weren+IBk-t just any chocolates+IBQ-they were alcohol-filled
chocolates. I loved alcohol. Loved loved loved it. My whole life I+IBk-d steal sips of
grown-ups+IBk- drinks whenever I could.
     We reached in, grabbed a few, drank the liquor inside, and then gobbled
down the chocolates. We+IBk-d hit the jackpot. We started going back again and again
to steal more. We+IBk-d wait for the shops to start to close, then we+IBk-d go and sit against
the gate, acting like we were just hanging out. We+IBk-d check to make sure the coast
was clear, and then one of us would reach in, grab a chocolate, and drink the
whiskey. Reach in, grab a chocolate, drink the rum. Reach in, grab a chocolate,
drink the brandy. We did this every weekend for at least a month, having the best
time. Then we pushed our luck too far.
    It was a Saturday night. We were hanging out at the entrance to the stationery
shop, leaning up against the gate. I reached in to grab a chocolate, and at that
exact moment a mall cop came around the corner and saw me with my arm in up
to my shoulder. I brought my hand out with a bunch of chocolates in it. It was
almost like a movie. I saw him. He saw me. His eyes went wide. I tried to walk
away, acting natural. Then he shouted out, +IBw-Hey+ACE- Stop+ACEgHQ-
     And the chase was on. We bolted, heading for the doors. I knew if a guard cut
us off at the exit we+IBk-d be trapped, so we were hauling ass as fast as we could. We
cleared the exit. The second we hit the parking lot, mall cops were coming at us
from every direction, a dozen of them at least. I was running with my head down.
These guards knew me. I was in that mall all the time. The guards knew my mom,
too. She did her banking at that mall. If they even caught a glimpse of who I was, I
was dead.
     We ran straight across the parking lot, ducking and weaving between parked
cars, the guards right behind us, yelling. We made it to the petrol station out at the
road, ran through there, and hooked left up the main road. They chased and
chased and we ran and ran, and it was awesome. The risk of getting caught was
half the fun of being naughty, and now the chase was on. I was loving it. I was
shitting myself, but also loving it. This was my turf. This was my neighborhood.
You couldn+IBk-t catch me in my neighborhood. I knew every alley and every street,
every back wall to climb over, every fence with a gap big enough to slip through. I
knew every shortcut you could possibly imagine. As a kid, wherever I went,
whatever building I was in, I was always plotting my escape. You know, in case
shit went down. In reality I was a nerdy kid with almost no friends, but in my
mind I was an important and dangerous man who needed to know where every
camera was and where all the exit points were.
     I knew we couldn+IBk-t run forever. We needed a plan. As Teddy and I booked
past the fire station there was a road off to the left, a dead end that ran into a
metal fence. I knew that there was a hole in the fence to squeeze through and on
the far side was an empty field behind the mall that took you back to the main
road and back to my house. A grown-up couldn+IBk-t fit through the hole, but a kid
could. All my years of imagining the life of a secret agent for myself finally paid
off. Now that I needed an escape, I had one.
    +IBw-Teddy, this way+ACEgHQ- I yelled.
    +IBw-No, it+IBk-s a dead end+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-We can get through+ACE- Follow me+ACEgHQ-
     He didn+IBk-t. I turned and ran into the dead end. Teddy broke the other way.
Half the mall cops followed him, half followed me. I got to the fence and knew
exactly how to squirm through. Head, then shoulder, one leg, then twist, then the
other leg+IBQ-done. I was through. The guards hit the fence behind me and couldn+IBk-t
follow. I ran across the field to a fence on the far side, popped through there, and
then I was right on the road, three blocks from my house. I slipped my hands into
my pockets and casually walked home, another harmless pedestrian out for a
stroll.
     Once I got back to my house I waited for Teddy. He didn+IBk-t show up. I waited
thirty minutes, forty minutes, an hour. No Teddy.
    Fuck.
    I ran to Teddy+IBk-s house in Linksfield. No Teddy. Monday morning I went to
school. Still no Teddy.
    Fuck.
    Now I was worried. After school I went home and checked at my house again,
nothing. Teddy+IBk-s house again, nothing. Then I ran back home.
    An hour later Teddy+IBk-s parents showed up. My mom greeted them at the door.
    +IBw-Teddy+IBk-s been arrested for shoplifting,+IB0- they said.
    Fuuuck.
     I eavesdropped on their whole conversation from the other room. From the
start my mom was certain I was involved.
    +IBw-Well, where was Trevor?+IB0- she asked.
    +IBw-Teddy said he wasn+IBk-t with Trevor,+IB0- they said.
    My mom was skeptical. +IBw-Hmm. Are you sure Trevor wasn+IBk-t involved?+IB0-
    +IBw-No, apparently not. The cops said there was another kid, but he got away.+IB0-
    +IBw-So it was Trevor.+IB0-
     +IBw-No, we asked Teddy, and he said it wasn+IBk-t Trevor. He said it was some other
kid.+IB0-
    +IBw-Huh+ICY-okay.+IB0- My mom called me in. +IBw-Do you know about this thing?+IB0-
    +IBw-What thing?+IB0-
    +IBw-Teddy was caught shoplifting.+IB0-
    +IBw-Whhaaat?+IB0- I played dumb. +IBw-Noooo. That+IBk-s crazy. I can+IBk-t believe it. Teddy?
No.+IB0-
       +IBw-Where were you?+IB0- my mom asked.
       +IBw-I was at home.+IB0-
       +IBw-But you+IBk-re always with Teddy.+IB0-
       I shrugged. +IBw-Not on this occasion, I suppose.+IB0-
    For a moment my mom thought she+IBk-d caught me red-handed, but Teddy+IBk-d
given me a solid alibi. I went back to my room, thinking I was in the clear.
                                           +IBQ-
The next day I was in class and my name was called over the PA system. +IBw-Trevor
Noah, report to the principal+IBk-s office.+IB0- All the kids were like, +IBw-Ooooohhh.+IB0- The
announcements could be heard in every classroom, so now, collectively, the whole
school knew I was in trouble. I got up and walked to the office and waited
anxiously on an uncomfortable wooden bench outside the door.
     Finally the principal, Mr. Friedman, walked out. +IBw-Trevor, come in.+IB0- Waiting
inside his office was the head of mall security, two uniformed police officers, and
my and Teddy+IBk-s homeroom teacher, Mrs. Vorster. A roomful of silent, stone-faced
white authority figures stood over me, the guilty young black man. My heart was
pounding. I took a seat.
    +IBw-Trevor, I don+IBk-t know if you know this,+IB0- Mr. Friedman said, +IBw-but Teddy was
arrested the other day.+IB0-
       +IBw-What?+IB0- I played the whole thing again. +IBw-Teddy? Oh, no. What for?+IB0-
      +IBw-For shoplifting. He+IBk-s been expelled, and he won+IBk-t be coming back to school.
We know there was another boy involved, and these officers are going around to
the schools in the area to investigate. We called you here because Mrs. Vorster
tells us you+IBk-re Teddy+IBk-s best friend, and we want to know: Do you know anything
about this?+IB0-
       I shook my head. +IBw-No, I don+IBk-t know anything.+IB0-
       +IBw-Do you know who Teddy was with?+IB0-
       +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay.+IB0- He stood up and walked over to a television in the corner of the room.
+IBw-Trevor, the police have video footage of the whole thing. We+IBk-d like you to take a
look at it.+IB0-
       Fuuuuu?uuuuu?uuuuu?uuck.
    My heart was pounding in my chest. Well, life, it+IBk-s been fun, I thought. I+IBk-m
going to get expelled. I+IBk-m going to go to jail. This is it.
    Mr. Friedman pressed Play on the VCR. The tape started. It was grainy, black-
and-white security-camera footage, but you could see what was happening plain
as day. They even had it from multiple angles: Me and Teddy reaching through the
gate. Me and Teddy racing for the door. They had the whole thing. After a few
seconds, Mr. Friedman reached up and paused it with me, from a few meters out,
freeze-framed in the middle of the screen. In my mind, this was when he was
going to turn to me and say, +IBw-Now would you like to confess?+IB0- He didn+IBk-t.
    +IBw-Trevor,+IB0- he said, +IBw-do you know of any white kids that Teddy hangs out with?+IB0-
    I nearly shat myself. +IBw-What?+ACEgHQ-
     I looked at the screen and I realized: Teddy was dark. I am light+ADs- I have olive
skin. But the camera can+IBk-t expose for light and dark at the same time. So when you
put me on a black-and-white screen next to a black person, the camera doesn+IBk-t
know what to do. If the camera has to pick, it picks me as white. My color gets
blown out. In this video, there was a black person and a white person. But still: It
was me. The picture wasn+IBk-t great, and my facial features were a bit blurry, but if
you looked closely: It was me. I was Teddy+IBk-s best friend. I was Teddy+IBk-s only friend.
I was the single most likely accomplice. You had to at least suspect that it was me.
They didn+IBk-t. They grilled me for a good ten minutes, but only because they were so
sure that I had to know who this white kid was.
    +IBw-Trevor, you+IBk-re Teddy+IBk-s best friend. Tell us the truth. Who is this kid?+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t know.+IB0-
    +IBw-You don+IBk-t recognize him at all?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Teddy never mentioned him to you?+IB0-
    +IBw-Never.+IB0-
    At a certain point Mrs. Vorster just started running through a list of all the
white kids she thought it could be.
    +IBw-Is it David?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Rian?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Frederik?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
     I kept waiting for it to be a trick, for them to turn and say, +IBw-It+IBk-s you+ACEgHQ- They
didn+IBk-t. At a certain point, I felt so invisible I almost wanted to take credit. I wanted
to jump up and point at the TV and say, +IBw-Are you people blind?+ACE- That+IBk-s me+ACE- Can
you not see that that+IBk-s me?+ACEgHQ- But of course I didn+IBk-t. And they couldn+IBk-t. These
people had been so fucked by their own construct of race that they could not see
that the white person they were looking for was sitting right in front of them.
      Eventually they sent me back to class. I spent the rest of the day and the next
couple of weeks waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting for my mom to get the
call. +IBw-We+IBk-ve got him+ACE- We figured it out+ACEgHQ- But the call never came.
S outh Africa has eleven official languages. After democracy came, people said, +IBw-Okay, how do
we create order without having different groups feel like they+IBk-ve been left out of power again?+IB0-
English is the international language and the language of money and of the media, so we had
to keep that. Most people were forced to learn at least some Afrikaans, so it+IBk-s useful to keep
that, too. Plus we didn+IBk-t want the white minority to feel ostracized in the new South Africa, or
else they+IBk-d take all their money and leave.
   Of the African languages, Zulu has the largest number of native speakers, but we couldn+IBk-t
keep that without also having Xhosa and Tswana and Ndebele. Then there+IBk-s Swazi, Tsonga,
Venda, Sotho, and Pedi. We tried to keep all the major groups happy, so the next thing we
knew we+IBk-d made eleven languages official languages. And those are just the languages big
enough to demand recognition+ADs- there are dozens more.
    It+IBk-s the Tower of Babel in South Africa. Every single day. Every day you see people
completely lost, trying to have conversations and having no idea what the other person is
saying. Zulu and Tswana are fairly common. Tsonga and Pedi are pretty fringe. The more
common your tongue, the less likely you are to learn others. The more fringe, the more likely
you are to pick up two or three. In the cities most people speak at least some English and
usually a bit of Afrikaans, enough to get around. You+IBk-ll be at a party with a dozen people where
bits of conversation are flying by in two or three different languages. You+IBk-ll miss part of it,
someone might translate on the fly to give you the gist, you pick up the rest from the context,
and you just figure it out. The crazy thing is that, somehow, it works. Society functions. Except
when it doesn+IBk-t.
        A YOUNG MAN+IBk-S LONG, AWKWARD,
  OCCASIONALLY TRAGIC, AND FREQUENTLY
    HUMILIATING EDUCATION IN AFFAIRS OF
           THE HEART, PART III: THE DANCE



By the end of high school I+IBk-d become a mogul. My tuck-shop business had evolved
into a mini-empire that included selling pirated CDs I made at home. I+IBk-d
convinced my mother, as frugal as she was, that I needed a computer for school. I
didn+IBk-t. I wanted it so I could surf the Internet and play Leisure Suit Larry. But I
was very convincing, and she broke down and got it for me. Thanks to the
computer, the Internet, and the fortunate gift of a CD writer from a friend, I was in
business.
     I had carved out my niche, and was having a great time+ADs- life was so good as an
outsider that I didn+IBk-t even think about dating. The only girls in my life were the
naked ones on my computer. While I downloaded music and messed around in
chat rooms, I+IBk-d dabble in porn sites here and there. No video, of course, only
pictures. With online porn today you just drop straight into the madness, but with
dial-up it took so long for the images to load. It was almost gentlemanly compared
to now. You+IBk-d spend a good five minutes looking at her face, getting to know her as
a person. Then a few minutes later you+IBk-d get some boobs. By the time you got to
her vagina, you+IBk-d spent a lot of quality time together.
     In September of grade twelve, the matric dance was coming up. Senior prom.
This was the big one. I was again faced with the dilemma of Valentine+IBk-s Day,
confronting another strange ritual I did not understand. All I knew about prom
was that, according to my American movies, prom is where it happens. You lose
your virginity. You go and you ride in the limousine, and then you and the girl do
the thing. That was literally my only reference. But I knew the rule: Cool guys get
girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool guys with their girls. So I+IBk-d
assumed I wouldn+IBk-t be going, or if I did go it wouldn+IBk-t be with a date.
    I had two middlemen working for me in my CD business, Bongani and Tom.
They sold the CDs that I copied in exchange for a cut. I met Tom at the arcade at
the Balfour Park mall. Like Teddy, he lived nearby because his mom was a
domestic worker. Tom was in my grade but went to a government school,
Northview, a proper ghetto school. Tom handled my CD sales over there.
    Tom was a chatterbox, hyperactive and go-go-go. He was a real hustler, too,
always trying to cut a deal, work an angle. He could get people to do anything. A
great guy, but fucking crazy and a complete liar as well. I went with him once to
Hammanskraal, a settlement that was like a homeland, but not really.
Hammanskraal, as its Afrikaans name suggests, was the kraal of Hamman, what
used to be a white man+IBk-s farm. The proper homelands, Venda and Gazankulu and
Transkei, were places where black people actually lived, and the government drew
a border around them and said, +IBw-Stay there.+IB0- Hammanskraal and settlements like
it were empty places on the map where deported black people had been relocated.
That+IBk-s what the government did. They would find some patch of arid, dusty,
useless land, and dig row after row of holes in the ground+IBQ-a thousand latrines to
serve four thousand families. Then they+IBk-d forcibly remove people from illegally
occupying some white area and drop them off in the middle of nowhere with some
pallets of plywood and corrugated iron. +IBw-Here. This is your new home. Build some
houses. Good luck.+IB0- We+IBk-d watch it on the news. It was like some heartless,
survival-based reality TV show, only nobody won any money.
    One afternoon in Hammanskraal, Tom told me we were going to see a talent
show. At the time, I had a pair of Timberland boots I+IBk-d bought. They were the only
decent piece of clothing I owned. Back then, almost no one in South Africa had
Timberlands. They were impossible to get, but everyone wanted them because
American rappers wore them. I+IBk-d scrimped and saved my tuck-shop money and
my CD money to buy them. As we were leaving, Tom told me, +IBw-Be sure to wear
your Timberlands.+IB0-
    The talent show was in this little community hall attached to nothing in the
middle of nowhere. When we got there, Tom was going around, shaking hands,
chatting with everybody. There was singing, dancing, some poetry. Then the host
got up onstage and said, +IBw-Re na le modiragatsi yo o kgethegileng. Ka kopo
amogelang+ICY-Spliff Star+ACEgHQ- +IBw-We+IBk-ve got a special performer, a rapper all the way
from America. Please welcome+ICY-Spliff Star+ACEgHQ-
    Spliff Star was Busta Rhymes+IBk-s hype man at the time. I sat there, confused.
What? Spliff Star? In Hammanskraal? Then everyone in the room turned and
looked at me. Tom walked over and whispered in my ear.
    +IBw-Dude, come up onstage.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-Come onstage.+IB0-
    +IBw-Dude, what are you talking about?+IB0-
    +IBw-Dude, please, you+IBk-re gonna get me in so much shit. They+IBk-ve already paid me
the money.+IB0-
    +IBw-Money? What money?+IB0-
    Of course, what Tom had failed to tell me was that he+IBk-d told these people he
was bringing a famous rapper from America to come and rap in their talent show.
He had demanded to be paid up front for doing so, and I, in my Timberlands, was
that famous American rapper.
    +IBw-Screw you,+IB0- I said. +IBw-I+IBk-m not going anywhere.+IB0-
     +IBw-Please, dude, I+IBk-m begging you. Please do me this favor. Please. There+IBk-s this
girl here, and I wanna get with her, and I told her I know all these rappers+ICY-Please.
I+IBk-m begging you.+IB0-
    +IBw-Dude, I+IBk-m not Spliff Star. What am I gonna do?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Just rap Busta Rhymes songs.+IB0-
    +IBw-But I don+IBk-t know any of the lyrics.+IB0-
    +IBw-It doesn+IBk-t matter. These people don+IBk-t speak English.+IB0-
    +IBw-Aw, fuck.+IB0-
    I got up onstage and Tom did some terrible beat-boxing+IBQgHA-Bff ba-dff, bff bff
ba-dff+IB0gFA-while I stumbled through some Busta Rhymes lyrics that I made up as I
went along. The audience erupted with cheers and applause. An American rapper
had come to Hammanskraal, and it was the most epic thing they had ever seen.
    So that+IBk-s Tom.
    One afternoon Tom came by my house and we started talking about the
dance. I told him I didn+IBk-t have a date, couldn+IBk-t get a date, and wasn+IBk-t going to get a
date.
    +IBw-I can get you a girl to go with you to the dance,+IB0- he said.
    +IBw-No, you can+IBk-t.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes, I can. Let+IBk-s make a deal.+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t want one of your deals, Tom.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, listen, here+IBk-s the deal. If you give me a better cut on the CDs I+IBk-m selling,
plus a bunch of free music for myself, I+IBk-ll come back with the most beautiful girl
you+IBk-ve ever seen in your life, and she+IBk-ll be your date for the dance.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay, I+IBk-ll take that deal because it+IBk-s never going to happen.+IB0-
    +IBw-Do we have a deal?+IB0-
    +IBw-We have a deal, but it+IBk-s not going to happen.+IB0-
    +IBw-But do we have a deal?+IB0-
    +IBw-It+IBk-s a deal.+IB0-
     +IBw-Okay, I+IBk-m going to find you a date. She+IBk-s going to be the most beautiful girl
you+IBk-ve ever seen, and you+IBk-re going to take her to the matric dance and you+IBk-re going
to be a superstar.+IB0-
     The dance was still two months away. I promptly forgot about Tom and his
ridiculous deal. Then he came over to my house one afternoon and popped his
head into my room.
    +IBw-I found the girl.+IB0-
    +IBw-Really?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah. You have to come and meet her.+IB0-
      I knew Tom was full of shit, but the thing that makes a con man successful is
that he never gives you nothing. He delivers just enough to keep you believing.
Tom had introduced me to many beautiful women. He was never dating them, but
he talked a good game, and was always around them. So when he said he had a
girl, I didn+IBk-t doubt him. The two of us jumped on a bus and headed into the city.
     The girl lived in a run-down block of flats downtown. We found her building,
and a girl leaned over the balcony and waved us inside. That was the girl+IBk-s sister
Lerato, Tom said. Come to find out, he+IBk-d been trying to get with Lerato, and
setting me up with the sister was his way in+IBQ-of course, Tom was working an
angle.
     It was dark in the lobby. The elevator was busted, so we walked up several
flights. This girl Lerato brought us into the flat. In the living room was this giant,
but I mean really, really enormous, fat woman. I was like, Oh, Tom. I see what
you+IBk-ve done here. Nicely played. Tom was a big joker as well.
    +IBw-Is this my date?+IB0- I asked.
     +IBw-No, no, no,+IB0- he said. +IBw-This is not your date. This is her older sister. Your date
is Babiki. Babiki has three older sisters, and Lerato is her younger sister. Babiki+IBk-s
gone to the store to buy groceries. She+IBk-ll be back in a moment.+IB0-
    We waited, chatted with the older sister. Ten minutes later the door opened
and the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life walked in. She was+ICY-good
Lord. Beautiful eyes, beautiful golden yellow-brown skin. It was like she glowed.
No girl at my high school looked anything like her.
    +IBw-Hi,+IB0- she said.
    +IBw-Hi,+IB0- I replied.
      I was dumbfounded. I had no idea how to talk to a girl that beautiful. She was
shy and didn+IBk-t speak much, either. There was a bit of an awkward pause. Luckily
Tom+IBk-s a guy who just talks and talks. He jumped right in and smoothed everything
over. +IBw-Trevor, this is Babiki. Babiki, Trevor.+IB0- He went on and on about how great I
was, how much she was looking forward to the dance, when I would pick her up
for the dance, all the details. We hung out for a few, and then Tom needed to get
going so we headed out the door. Babiki turned and smiled at me and waved as we
left.
    +IBw-Bye.+IB0-
    +IBw-Bye.+IB0-
    We walked out of that building and I was the happiest man on earth. I
couldn+IBk-t believe it. I was the guy at school who couldn+IBk-t get a date. I+IBk-d resigned
myself to never getting a date, didn+IBk-t consider myself worthy of having a date. But
now I was going to the matric dance with the most beautiful girl in the world.
    Over the following weeks we went down to Hillbrow a few more times to hang
out with Babiki and her sisters and her friends. Babiki+IBk-s family was Pedi, one of
South Africa+IBk-s smaller tribes. I liked getting to know people of different
backgrounds, so that was fun. Babiki and her friends were what we call
amabhujua. They+IBk-re as poor as most other black people, but they try to act like
they+IBk-re not. They dress fashionably and act rich. Amabhujua will put a shirt on
layaway, one shirt, and spend seven months paying it off. They+IBk-ll live in shacks
wearing Italian leather shoes that cost thousands. An interesting crowd.
    Babiki and I never went on a date alone. It was always the two of us in a
group. She was shy, and I was a nervous wreck most of the time, but we had fun.
Tom kept everyone loose and having a good time. Whenever we+IBk-d say goodbye,
Babiki would give me a hug, and once she even gave me a little kiss. I was in
heaven. I was like, Yeah, I+IBk-ve got a girlfriend. Cool.
                                         +IBQ-
As the dance approached, I started getting nervous. I didn+IBk-t have a car. I didn+IBk-t
have any decent clothes. This was my first time taking out a beautiful girl, and I
wanted it to be perfect.
     We+IBk-d moved to Highlands North when my stepfather+IBk-s garage went out of
business, and he moved his workshop to the house. We had a big yard and a
garage in the back, and that became his new workshop, essentially. At any given
time, we had at least ten or fifteen cars in the driveway, in the yard, and out on the
street, clients+IBk- cars being worked on and old junkers Abel kept around to tinker
with. One afternoon Tom and I were at the house. Tom was telling Abel about my
date, and Abel decided to be generous. He said I could take a car for the dance.
    There was a red Mazda that we+IBk-d had for a while, a complete piece of shit but
it worked well enough. I+IBk-d borrowed it before, but the car I really wanted was
Abel+IBk-s BMW. It was old and beat-up like the Mazda, but a shit BMW is still a
BMW. I begged him to let me take it.
    +IBw-Please, please, can I use the BMW?+IB0-
    +IBw-Not a fucking chance.+IB0-
    +IBw-Please. This is the greatest moment in my life. Please. I+IBk-m begging you.+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Please.+IB0-
    +IBw-No. You can take the Mazda.+IB0-
    Tom, always the hustler and the dealmaker, stepped in.
     +IBw-Bra Abie,+IB0- he said. +IBw-I don+IBk-t think you understand. If you saw the girl Trevor
is taking to the dance, you would see why this is so important. Let+IBk-s make a deal. If
we bring her here and she+IBk-s the most beautiful girl you+IBk-ve ever seen in your life,
you+IBk-ll let him take the BMW.+IB0-
    Abel thought about it.
    +IBw-Okay. Deal.+IB0-
    We went to Babiki+IBk-s flat, told her my parents wanted to meet her, and brought
her back to my house. Then we brought her around to the garage in the back
where Abel and his guys were working. Tom and I went over and introduced them.
    +IBw-Abel, this is Babiki. Babiki, this is Abel.+IB0-
    Abel smiled big, was charming as always.
    +IBw-Nice to meet you,+IB0- he said.
    They chatted for a few minutes. Tom and Babiki left. Abel turned to me.
    +IBw-Is that the girl?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes.+IB0-
    +IBw-You can take the BMW.+IB0-
     Once I had the car, I desperately needed something to wear. I was taking out
this girl who was really into fashion, and, except for my Timberlands, everything I
owned was shit. I was limited in my wardrobe choices because I was stuck buying
in the shops my mother let me go to, and my mother did not believe in spending
money on clothes. She+IBk-d take me to some bargain clothing store and tell me what
our budget was, and I+IBk-d have to find something to wear.
     At the time I had no clue about clothes. My idea of fashion was a brand of
clothing called Powerhouse. It was the kind of stuff weight lifters wear down in
Miami or out at Venice Beach, baggy track pants with baggy sweatshirts. The logo
was a cartoon of this giant bodybuilding bulldog wearing wraparound sunglasses
and smoking a cigar and flexing his muscles. On the pants he was flexing all the
way down your leg. On the shirt he was flexing across your chest. On the
underwear, he was flexing on your crotch. I thought Powerhouse was the baddest
thing in the world, I can+IBk-t even front. I had no friends, I loved dogs, and muscles
were cool+IBQ-that+IBk-s where I was working from. I had Powerhouse everything, the full
range, five of the same outfit in five different colors. It was easy. The pants came
with the top, so I knew how to make it work.
     Bongani, the other middleman from my CD business, found out I had a date,
and he made it his mission to give me a makeover. +IBw-You need to up your game,+IB0- he
said. +IBw-You cannot go to the dance looking the way you look+IBQ-for her sake, not
yours. Let+IBk-s go shopping.+IB0-
    I went to my mom and begged her to give me money to buy something to
wear for the dance. She finally relented and gave me 2,000 rand, for one outfit. It
was the most money she+IBk-d ever given me for anything in my life. I told Bongani
how much I had to spend, and he said we+IBk-d make it work. The trick to looking rich,
he told me, is to have one expensive item, and for the rest of the things you get
basic, good-looking quality stuff. The nice item will draw everyone+IBk-s eye, and it+IBk-ll
look like you+IBk-ve spent more than you have.
      In my mind nothing was cooler than the leather coats everybody wore in The
Matrix. The Matrix came out while I was in high school and it was my favorite
movie at the time. I loved Neo. In my heart I knew: I am Neo. He+IBk-s a nerd. He+IBk-s
useless at everything, but secretly he+IBk-s a badass superhero. All I needed was a bald,
mysterious black man to come into my life and show me the way. Now I had
Bongani, black, head shaved, telling me, +IBw-You can do it. You+IBk-re the one.+IB0- And I was
like, +IBw-Yes. I knew it.+IB0-
     I told Bongani I wanted a leather coat like Keanu Reeves wore, the ankle-
length black one. Bongani shut that down. +IBw-No, that+IBk-s not practical. It+IBk-s cool, but
you+IBk-ll never be able to wear it again.+IB0- He took me shopping and we bought a calf-
length black leather jacket, which would look ridiculous today but at the time,
thanks to Neo, was very cool. That alone cost 1,200 rand. Then we finished the
outfit with a pair of simple black pants, suede square-toed shoes, and a cream-
white knitted sweater.
    Once we had the outfit, Bongani took a long look at my enormous Afro. I was
forever trying to get the perfect 1970s Michael Jackson Afro. What I had was more
Buckwheat: unruly and impossible to comb, like stabbing a pitchfork into a bed of
crabgrass.
    +IBw-We need to fix that fucking hair,+IB0- Bongani said.
    +IBw-What do you mean?+IB0- I said. +IBw-This is just my hair.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, we have to do something.+IB0-
   Bongani lived in Alexandra. He dragged me there, and we went to talk to
some girls from his street who were hanging out on the corner.
    +IBw-What would you do with this guy+IBk-s hair?+IB0- he asked them.
    The girls looked me over.
    +IBw-He has so much,+IB0- one of them said. +IBw-Why doesn+IBk-t he cornrow it?+IB0-
    +IBw-Shit, yeah,+IB0- they said. +IBw-That+IBk-s great+ACEgHQ-
    I said, +IBw-What? Cornrows? No+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-No, no,+IB0- they said. +IBw-Do it.+IB0-
   Bongani dragged me to a hair salon down the street. We went in and sat
down. The woman touched my hair, shook her head, and turned to Bongani.
    +IBw-I can+IBk-t work with this sheep,+IB0- she said. +IBw-You have to do something about
this.+IB0-
     +IBw-What do we need to do?+IB0-
     +IBw-You have to relax it. I don+IBk-t do that here.+IB0-
     +IBw-Okay.+IB0-
      Bongani dragged me to a second salon. I sat down in the chair, and the
woman took my hair and started painting this creamy white stuff in it. She was
wearing rubber gloves to keep this chemical relaxer off her own skin, which should
have been my first clue that maybe this wasn+IBk-t such a great idea. Once my hair was
full of the relaxer, she told me, +IBw-You have to try to keep it in for as long as possible.
It+IBk-s going to start burning. When it starts burning, tell me and we+IBk-ll rinse it out.
But the longer you can handle it, the straighter your hair will become.+IB0-
     I wanted to do it right, so I sat in the chair and waited and waited for as long
as I could.
     I waited too long.
      She+IBk-d told me to tell her when it started burning. She should have told me to
tell her when it started tingling, because by the time it was actually burning it had
already taken off several layers of my scalp. I was well past tingling when I started
to freak out. +IBw-It+IBk-s burning+ACE- It+IBk-s burning+ACEgHQ- She rushed me over to the sink and
started to rinse the relaxer out. What I didn+IBk-t know is that the chemical doesn+IBk-t
really start to burn until it+IBk-s being rinsed out. I felt like someone was pouring
liquid fire onto my head. When she was done I had patches of acid burns all over
my scalp.
     I was the only man in the salon+ADs- it was all women. It was a window into what
women experience to look good on a regular basis. Why would they ever do this?,
I thought. This is horrible. But it worked. My hair was completely straight. The
woman combed it back, and I looked like a pimp, a pimp named Slickback.
     Bongani then dragged me back to the first salon, and the woman agreed to
cornrow my hair. She worked slowly. It took six hours. Finally she said, +IBw-Okay, you
can look in the mirror.+IB0- She turned me around in the chair and I looked in the
mirror and+ICY-I had never seen myself like that before. It was like the makeover
scenes in my American movies, where they take the dorky guy or girl, fix the hair
and change the clothes, and the ugly duckling becomes the swan. I+IBk-d been so
convinced I+IBk-d never get a date that I never tried to look nice for a girl, so I didn+IBk-t
know that I could. The hair was good. My skin wasn+IBk-t perfect, but it was getting
better+ADs- the pustules had receded into regular pimples. I looked+ICY-not bad.
     I went home, and my mom squealed when I walked in the door.
      +IBw-Ooooooh+ACE- They turned my baby boy into a pretty little girl+ACE- I+IBk-ve got a little
girl+ACE- You+IBk-re so pretty+ACEgHQ-
     +IBw-Mom+ACE- C+IBk-mon. Stop it.+IB0-
    +IBw-Is this the way you+IBk-re telling me that you+IBk-re gay?+IB0-
    +IBw-What? No. Why would you say that?+IB0-
    +IBw-You know it+IBk-s okay if you are.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, Mom. I+IBk-m not gay.+IB0-
    Everyone in my family loved it. They all thought it looked great. My mom did
tease the shit out of me, though.
    +IBw-It+IBk-s very well done,+IB0- she said, +IBw-but it is way too pretty. You do look like a girl.+IB0-
                                          +IBQ-
The big night finally came. Tom came over to help me get ready. The hair, the
clothes, everything came together perfectly. Once I was set, we went to Abel to get
the keys to the BMW, and that was the moment the whole night started to go
wrong.
     It was a Saturday night, end of the week, which meant Abel was drinking with
his workers. I walked out to his garage, and as soon as I saw his eyes I knew: He
was wasted. Fuck. When Abel was drunk he was a completely different person.
    +IBw-Ah, you look nice+ACEgHQ- he said with a big smile, looking me over. +IBw-Where are you
going?+IB0-
    +IBw-Where am I+IBQ-Abie, I+IBk-m going to the dance.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay. Have fun.+IB0-
    +IBw-Um+ICY-can I get the keys?+IB0-
    +IBw-The keys to what?+IB0-
    +IBw-To the car.+IB0-
    +IBw-What car?+IB0-
    +IBw-The BMW. You promised I could drive the BMW to the dance.+IB0-
    +IBw-First go buy me some beers,+IB0- he said.
    He gave me his car keys+ADs- Tom and I drove to the liquor store. I bought Abel a
few cases of beer, drove back, and unloaded it for him.
    +IBw-Okay,+IB0- I said, +IBw-can I take the BMW now?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-What do you mean +IBg-no+IBk-?+IB0-
    +IBw-I mean +IBg-no.+IBk- I need my car tonight.+IB0-
    +IBw-But you promised. You said I could take it.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, but I need the car.+IB0-
    I was crushed. I sat there with Tom and begged him for close to half an hour.
    +IBw-Please.+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Please.+IB0-
    +IBw-Nope.+IB0-
     Finally we realized it wasn+IBk-t going to happen. We took the shitty Mazda and
drove to Babiki+IBk-s house. I was an hour late picking her up. She was completely
pissed off. Tom had to go in and convince her to come out, and eventually she did.
      She was even more gorgeous than before, in an amazing red dress, but she
was clearly not in a great mood. Inside I was quietly starting to panic, but I smiled
and kept trying my gentlemanly best to be a good date, holding the door for her,
telling her how beautiful she was. Tom and the sister gave us a send-off and we
headed out.
     Then I got lost. The dance was being held at some venue in a part of town I
wasn+IBk-t familiar with, and at some point I got completely turned around and had no
idea where I was. I drove around for an hour in the dark, going left, going right,
doubling back. I was on my cellphone the whole time, desperately calling people,
trying to figure out where I was, trying to get directions. Babiki sat next to me in
stony silence the whole time, clearly not feeling me or this night at all. I was
crashing hard. I was late. I didn+IBk-t know where I was going. I was the worst date
she+IBk-d ever had in her life.
      I finally figured out where I was and we made it to the dance, nearly two
hours late. I parked, jumped out, and ran around to get her door. When I opened
it, she just sat there.
    +IBw-Are you ready?+IB0- I said. +IBw-Let+IBk-s go in.+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-No? What+ICY-what do you mean, +IBg-no+IBk-?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay+ICY-but why?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-But we need to go inside. The dance is inside.+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
     I stood there for another twenty minutes, trying to convince her to come
inside, but she kept saying +IBw-no.+IB0- She wouldn+IBk-t get out of the car.
    Finally, I said, +IBw-Okay, I+IBk-ll be right back.+IB0-
    I ran inside and found Bongani.
    +IBw-Where have you been?+IB0- he said.
    +IBw-I+IBk-m here+ACE- But my date+IBk-s in the car and she won+IBk-t come in.+IB0-
    +IBw-What do you mean she won+IBk-t come in?+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t know what+IBk-s going on. Please help me.+IB0-
     We went back out to the parking lot. I took Bongani over to the car, and the
second he saw her he lost it. +IBw-Jesus in Heaven+ACE- This is the most beautiful woman
I+IBk-ve ever seen. You said she was beautiful, Trevor, but this is insane.+IB0- In an instant
he completely forgot about helping me with Babiki. He turned and ran back inside
and called to the guys. +IBw-Guys+ACE- You gotta come see this+ACE- Trevor got a date+ACE- And
she+IBk-s beautiful+ACE- Guys+ACE- Come out here+ACEgHQ-
     Twenty guys came running out into the parking lot. They clustered around the
car. +IBw-Yo, she+IBk-s so hot+ACEgHQ- +IBw-Dude, this girl came with Trevor?+IB0- Guys were gawking at
her like she was an animal at the zoo. They were asking to take pictures with her.
They were calling back to more people inside. +IBw-This is insane+ACE- Look at Trevor+IBk-s
date+ACE- No, no, no, you gotta come and see+ACEgHQ-
     I was mortified. I+IBk-d spent four years of high school carefully avoiding any kind
of romantic humiliation whatsoever, and now, on the night of the matric dance,
the night of all nights, my humiliation had turned into a circus bigger than the
event itself: Trevor the undatable clown thought he was going to have the most
beautiful girl at the dance, but he+IBk-s crashing and burning so let+IBk-s all go outside and
watch.
     Babiki sat in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, refusing to budge. I
was outside the car, pacing, stressed out. A friend of mine had a bottle of brandy
that he+IBk-d smuggled into the dance. +IBw-Here,+IB0- he said, +IBw-have some of this.+IB0- Nothing
mattered at that point, so I started drinking. I+IBk-d fucked up. The girl didn+IBk-t like me.
The night was done.
     Most of the guys eventually wandered back inside. I was sitting on the
pavement, taking swigs from the brandy bottle, getting buzzed. At some point
Bongani went back over to the car to try one last time to convince Babiki to come
in. After a minute his head popped up over the car with this confused look.
    +IBw-Yo, Trevor,+IB0- he said, +IBw-your date does not speak English.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0-
    +IBw-Your date. She does not speak any English.+IB0-
    +IBw-That+IBk-s not possible.+IB0-
    I got up and walked over to the car. I asked her a question in English and she
gave me a blank stare.
    Bongani looked at me.
    +IBw-How did you not know that your date does not speak English?+IB0-
    +IBw-I+ICY-I don+IBk-t know.+IB0-
    +IBw-Have you never spoken to her?+IB0-
    +IBw-Of course I have+IBQ-or, wait+ICY-have I?+IB0-
     I started flashing back through all the times I+IBk-d been with Babiki, meeting at
her flat, hanging out with her friends, introducing her to Abel. Did I talk to her
then? No. Did I talk to her then? No. It was like the scene in Fight Club where Ed
Norton+IBk-s character flashes back and realizes he and Brad Pitt have never been in
the same room with Helena Bonham Carter at the same time. He realizes he+IBk-s
been punching himself the whole time. He+IBk-s Tyler Durden. In all the excitement of
meeting Babiki, the times we were hanging out and getting to know each other, we
were never actually speaking to each other. It was always through Tom.
    Fucking Tom.
    Tom had promised he+IBk-d get me a beautiful date for the dance, but he hadn+IBk-t
made any promises about any of her other qualities. Whenever we were together,
she was speaking Pedi to Tom, and Tom was speaking English to me. But she
didn+IBk-t speak English, and I didn+IBk-t speak Pedi. Abel spoke Pedi. He+IBk-d learned
several South African languages in order to deal with his customers, so he+IBk-d
spoken with her fluently when they met. But in that moment I realized I+IBk-d never
actually heard her say anything in English other than: +IBw-Yes.+IB0- +IBw-No.+IB0- +IBw-Hi.+IB0- +IBw-Bye.+IB0-
That+IBk-s it: +IBw-Yes.+IB0- +IBw-No.+IB0- +IBw-Hi.+IB0- +IBw-Bye.+IB0-
      Babiki was so shy that she didn+IBk-t talk much to begin with, and I was so inept
with women that I didn+IBk-t know how to talk to her. I+IBk-d never had a girlfriend+ADs- I
didn+IBk-t even know what +IBw-girlfriend+IB0- meant. Someone put a beautiful woman on my
arm and said, +IBw-She+IBk-s your girlfriend.+IB0- I+IBk-d been mesmerized by her beauty and just
the idea of her+IBQ-I didn+IBk-t know I was supposed to talk to her. The naked women on
my computer, I+IBk-d never had to talk to them, ask them their opinions, ask them
about their feelings. And I was afraid I+IBk-d open my mouth and ruin the whole thing,
so I just nodded and smiled along and let Tom do the talking.
     All three of Babiki+IBk-s older sisters spoke English, and her younger sister Lerato
spoke a little. So whenever we hung out with Babiki and her sisters and their
friends, a lot of the conversation was in English. The rest of it was going right by
me in Pedi or in Sotho, but that+IBk-s completely normal in South Africa so it never
bothered me+ADs- I got enough of the gist of the conversation from everyone+IBk-s English
to know what was going on. And the way my mind works with language, even
when I+IBk-m hearing other languages, they get filtered into English as I+IBk-m hearing
them. My mind stores them in English. When my grandmother and great-
grandmother were hysterically praying to God to destroy the demon that had shit
on their kitchen floor, all of that transpired in Xhosa, but it+IBk-s stored in English. I
remember it as English. So whenever I lay in bed at night dreaming about Babiki
and the moments we+IBk-d spent together, I felt like it had transpired in English
because that+IBk-s how I remembered it. And Tom had never said anything about what
language she spoke or didn+IBk-t speak, because why would he care? He just wanted to
get his free CDs and get with the sister. Which is how I+IBk-d been dating a girl for over
a month+IBQ-the girl I very much believed was my first girlfriend+IBQ-without ever
having had a single conversation with her.
    Now the whole night came rushing back and I saw it from her point of view,
and it was perfectly obvious to me why she didn+IBk-t want to get out of the car. She
probably hadn+IBk-t wanted to go to the dance with me in the first place+ADs- she probably
owed Tom a favor, and Tom can talk anyone into anything. Then I+IBk-d left her sitting
and waiting for me for an hour and she was pissed off. Then she got into the car
and it was the first time we had ever been alone, and she realized I couldn+IBk-t even
hold a conversation with her. I+IBk-d driven her around and gotten lost in the dark+IBQ-a
young girl alone in a car in the middle of nowhere with some strange guy, no idea
where I was taking her. She was probably terrified. Then we got to the dance and
she didn+IBk-t speak anyone+IBk-s language. She didn+IBk-t know anyone. She didn+IBk-t even
know me.
    Bongani and I stood outside the car, staring at each other. I didn+IBk-t know what
to do. I tried talking to her in every language I knew. Nothing worked. She only
spoke Pedi. I got so desperate that I started trying to talk to her using hand
signals.
    +IBw-Please. You. Me. Inside. Dance. Yes?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
    +IBw-Inside. Dance. Please?+IB0-
    +IBw-No.+IB0-
     I asked Bongani if he spoke Pedi. He didn+IBk-t. I ran inside to the dance and ran
around looking for someone who spoke Pedi to help me to convince her to come
in. +IBw-Do you speak Pedi? Do you speak Pedi? Do you speak Pedi?+IB0- Nobody spoke
Pedi.
    So I never got to go to my matric dance. Other than the three minutes I spent
running through it looking for someone who spoke Pedi, I spent the whole night in
the parking lot. When the dance ended, I climbed back into the shitty red Mazda
and drove Babiki home. We sat in total awkward silence the whole way.
     I pulled up in front of her block of flats in Hillbrow, stopped the car, and sat
for a moment as I tried to figure out the polite and gentlemanly way to end the
evening. Then, out of nowhere, she leaned over and gave me a kiss. Like, a real
kiss, a proper kiss. The kind of kiss that made me forget that the whole disaster
had just happened. I was so confused. I didn+IBk-t know what I was supposed to do.
She pulled back and I looked deep into her eyes and thought, I have no idea how
girls work.
    I got out of the car, walked around to her side, and opened her door. She
gathered up her dress and stepped out and headed toward her flat, and as she
turned to go I gave her one last little wave.
    +IBw-Bye.+IB0-
+IBw-Bye.+IB0-
I n Germany, no child finishes high school without learning about the Holocaust. Not just the
facts of it but the how and the why and the gravity of it+IBQ-what it means. As a result, Germans
grow up appropriately aware and apologetic. British schools treat colonialism the same way,
to an extent. Their children are taught the history of the Empire with a kind of disclaimer
hanging over the whole thing. +IBw-Well, that was shameful, now wasn+IBk-t it?+IB0-
    In South Africa, the atrocities of apartheid have never been taught that way. We weren+IBk-t
taught judgment or shame. We were taught history the way it+IBk-s taught in America. In America,
the history of racism is taught like this: +IBw-There was slavery and then there was Jim Crow and
then there was Martin Luther King Jr. and now it+IBk-s done.+IB0- It was the same for us. +IBw-Apartheid
was bad. Nelson Mandela was freed. Let+IBk-s move on.+IB0- Facts, but not many, and never the
emotional or moral dimension. It was as if the teachers, many of whom were white, had been
given a mandate. +IBw-Whatever you do, don+IBk-t make the kids angry.+IB0-
                                                              GO HITLER+ACE-



When I was in grade nine, three Chinese kids transferred to Sandringham: Bolo,
Bruce Lee, and John. They were the only Chinese kids in the school, out of a
thousand pupils. Bolo got his nickname because he looked like Bolo Yeung from
the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Bloodsport. Bruce Lee+IBk-s name really was
Bruce Lee, which made our lives. Here was this Chinese guy, quiet, good-looking,
in great shape, and his name was Bruce Lee. We were like, This is magic. Thank
you, Jesus, for bringing us Bruce Lee. John was just John, which was weird
because of the other two.
     I got to know Bolo because he was one of my tuck-shop clients. Bolo+IBk-s parents
were professional pirates. They pirated videogames and sold them at flea markets.
As the son of pirates, Bolo did the same thing+IBQ-he started selling bootleg
PlayStation games around school. Kids would give him their PlayStation, and he+IBk-d
bring it back a few days later with a chip in it that enabled them to play pirated
games, which he would then sell them. Bolo was friends with this white kid and
fellow pirate named Andrew, who traded in bootleg CDs. Andrew was two grades
above me and a real computer geek+ADs- he even had a CD writer at home, back when
nobody had CD writers.
     One day on my tuck-shop rounds, I overheard Andrew and Bolo complaining
about the black kids at school. They+IBk-d realized that they could take Andrew+IBk-s and
Bolo+IBk-s merchandise, say +IBw-I+IBk-ll pay you later,+IB0- and then not pay, because Andrew and
Bolo were too scared of black people to go back to ask for the money. I leaned in to
their conversation and said, +IBw-Listen, you shouldn+IBk-t get upset. Black people don+IBk-t
have any money, so trying to get more stuff for less money is just what we do. But
let me help. I+IBk-ll be your middleman. You give me the merchandise and I+IBk-ll sell it,
and then I+IBk-ll handle getting the money. In return, you give me a cut of the sale.+IB0-
They liked the idea right away, and we became partners.
    As the tuck-shop guy, I was perfectly positioned. I had my network set up. All
I had to do was tap into it. With the money I made selling CDs and videogames, I
was able to save up and add new components and more memory to my own
computer. Andrew the computer geek showed me how to do it, where to buy the
cheapest parts, how to assemble them, how to repair them. He showed me how his
business worked, too, how to download music, where to get rewritable CDs in
bulk. The only thing I was missing was my own CD writer, because it was the most
expensive component. At the time a CD writer cost as much as the rest of the
computer, nearly 2,000 rand.
      I worked as a middleman for Bolo and Andrew for a year. Then Bolo left
school+ADs- the rumor was that his parents got arrested. From that point on I worked
for Andrew, and then as he was about to matriculate he decided to quit the game.
+IBw-Trevor,+IB0- he told me, +IBw-you+IBk-ve been a loyal partner.+IB0- And, as thanks, he bequeathed
unto me his CD writer. At the time, black people barely had access to computers,
let+IBk-s start there. But a CD writer? That was the stuff of lore. It was mythical. The
day Andrew gave it to me, he changed my life. Thanks to him, I now controlled
production, sales, distribution+IBQ-I had everything I needed to lock down the
bootleg business.
     I was a natural capitalist. I loved selling stuff, and I was selling something
that everybody wanted and nobody else could provide. I sold my discs for 30 rand,
around +ACQ-3. A regular CD in the store cost 100 to 150 rand. Once people started
buying from me, they wouldn+IBk-t buy real CDs ever again+IBQ-the deal was too good.
      I had an instinct for business, but at the time I knew nothing about music,
which was odd for someone running a music-pirating business. The only music I
knew, still, was Christian music from church, the only music allowed in my
mother+IBk-s house. The CD writer Andrew gave me was a 1x CD writer, which meant
it copied at the speed it played. Every day I+IBk-d leave school, go to my room, and sit
for five to six hours, copying CDs. I had my own surround-sound system built with
old car speakers I+IBk-d salvaged from the junkers Abel kept in the yard, and I strung
them up around the room. Even though I had to sit there while each CD played,
for a long time I didn+IBk-t really listen to them. I knew it was against the dealer+IBk-s
code: Never get high on your own supply.
     Thanks to the Internet, I could get anyone anything. I never judged anyone+IBk-s
taste in music. You wanted the new Nirvana, I got you the new Nirvana. You
wanted the new DMX, I got you the new DMX. Local South African music was big,
but black American music was what people were desperate for, hip-hop and R+ACY-B.
Jagged Edge was huge. 112 was huge. I sold a lot of Montell Jordan. So much
Montell Jordan.
     When I started, I had a dial-up connection and a 24k modem. It would take a
day to download an album. But technology kept evolving, and I kept reinvesting in
the business. I upgraded to a 56k modem. I got faster CD writers, multiple CD
writers. I started downloading more, copying more, selling more. That+IBk-s when I
got two middlemen of my own, my friend Tom, who went to Northview, and my
friend Bongani, who lived in Alex.
     One day Bongani came to me and said, +IBw-You know what would make a lot of
money? Instead of copying whole albums, why don+IBk-t you put the best tracks of
different albums onto one CD, because people only wanna hear the songs they
like.+IB0- That sounded like a great idea, so I started making mix CDs. Those sold well.
Then a few weeks later Bongani came back and said, +IBw-Can you make the tracks
fade into one another so the music moves from track one to track two without a
break and the beat carries on? It+IBk-ll be like a DJ playing a complete set the whole
night.+IB0- That sounded like a great idea, too. I downloaded a program called BPM,
+IBw-beats per minute.+IB0- It had a graphical interface that looked like two vinyl records
side by side, and I could mix and fade between songs, basically everything a DJ
can do live. I started making party CDs, and those started selling like hotcakes,
too.
                                          +IBQ-
Business was booming. By matric I was balling, making 500 rand a week. To put
that in perspective, there are maids in South Africa who still earn less than that
today. It+IBk-s a shit salary if you+IBk-re trying to support a family, but as a sixteen-year-
old living at home with no real expenses, I was living the dream.
     For the first time in my life I had money, and it was the most liberating thing
in the world. The first thing I learned about having money was that it gives you
choices. People don+IBk-t want to be rich. They want to be able to choose. The richer
you are, the more choices you have. That is the freedom of money.
      With money, I experienced freedom on a whole new level: I went to
McDonald+IBk-s. People in America don+IBk-t understand, but when an American chain
opens in a third-world country, people go crazy. That+IBk-s true to this day. A Burger
King opened for the first time in South Africa last year, and there was a queue
around the block. It was an event. Everyone was going around saying, +IBw-I have to
eat at Burger King. Have you heard? It+IBk-s from America.+IB0- The funny thing was that
the queue was actually just white people. White people went bat-shit crazy for
Burger King. Black people were like, whatever. Black people didn+IBk-t need Burger
King. Our hearts were with KFC and McDonald+IBk-s. The crazy thing about
McDonald+IBk-s is that we knew about it long before it came, probably from movies.
We never even dreamed we would ever get one in South Africa+ADs- McDonald+IBk-s
seemed to us like one of those American things that is exclusively American and
can+IBk-t go anywhere else. Even before we ever tasted McDonald+IBk-s, we knew we+IBk-d love
it, and we did. At one point South Africa was opening more McDonald+IBk-s than any
other country in the world. With Mandela came freedom+IBQ-and with freedom came
McDonald+IBk-s. A McDonald+IBk-s had opened up just two blocks from our house not
long after we moved to Highlands North, but my mom would never pay for us to
eat there. With my own money I was like, Let+IBk-s do this. I went all in. They didn+IBk-t
have +IBw-supersize+IB0- at the time+ADs- +IBw-large+IB0- was the biggest. So I walked up to the
counter, feeling very impressed with myself, and I put down my money and said,
+IBw-I+IBk-ll have a large number one.+IB0-
    I fell in love with McDonald+IBk-s. McDonald+IBk-s, to me, tasted like America.
McDonald+IBk-s is America. You see it advertised and it looks amazing. You crave it.
You buy it. You take your first bite, and it blows your mind. It+IBk-s even better than
you imagined. Then, halfway through, you realize it+IBk-s not all it+IBk-s cracked up to be.
A few bites later you+IBk-re like, Hmm, there+IBk-s a lot wrong with this. Then you+IBk-re
done, you miss it like crazy, and you go back for more.
     Once I+IBk-d had a taste of America, I never ate at home. I only ate McDonald+IBk-s.
McDonald+IBk-s, McDonald+IBk-s, McDonald+IBk-s, McDonald+IBk-s. Every night my mother would
try to cook me dinner.
    +IBw-Tonight we+IBk-re having chicken livers.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, I+IBk-m gonna have McDonald+IBk-s.+IB0-
    +IBw-Tonight we+IBk-re having dog bones.+IB0-
    +IBw-I think I+IBk-m gonna go with McDonald+IBk-s again.+IB0-
    +IBw-Tonight we+IBk-re having chicken feet.+IB0-
    +IBw-Hmmmmm+ICY-Okay, I+IBk-m in. But tomorrow I+IBk-m eating McDonald+IBk-s.+IB0-
     The money kept rolling in and I was balling out of control. This is how balling
I was: I bought a cordless telephone. This was before everyone had a cellphone.
The range on this cordless phone was strong enough that I could put the base
outside my window, walk the two blocks to McDonald+IBk-s, order my large number
one, walk back home, go up to my room, and fire up my computer, carrying on a
conversation the whole time. I was that dude walking down the street holding a
giant phone to my ear with the aerial fully extended, talking to my friend. +IBw-Yeah,
I+IBk-m just goin+IBk- down to McDonald+IBk-s+ICYgHQ-
     Life was good, and none of it would have happened without Andrew. Without
him, I would never have mastered the world of music piracy and lived a life of
endless McDonald+IBk-s. What he did, on a small scale, showed me how important it is
to empower the dispossessed and the disenfranchised in the wake of oppression.
Andrew was white. His family had access to education, resources, computers. For
generations, while his people were preparing to go to university, my people were
crowded into thatched huts singing, +IBw-Two times two is four. Three times two is
six. La la la la la.+IB0- My family had been denied the things his family had taken for
granted. I had a natural talent for selling to people, but without knowledge and
resources, where was that going to get me? People always lecture the poor: +IBw-Take
responsibility for yourself+ACE- Make something of yourself+ACEgHQ- But with what raw
materials are the poor to make something of themselves?
     People love to say, +IBw-Give a man a fish, and he+IBk-ll eat for a day. Teach a man to
fish, and he+IBk-ll eat for a lifetime.+IB0- What they don+IBk-t say is, +IBw-And it would be nice if
you gave him a fishing rod.+IB0- That+IBk-s the part of the analogy that+IBk-s missing. Working
with Andrew was the first time in my life I realized you need someone from the
privileged world to come to you and say, +IBw-Okay, here+IBk-s what you need, and here+IBk-s
how it works.+IB0- Talent alone would have gotten me nowhere without Andrew giving
me the CD writer. People say, +IBw-Oh, that+IBk-s a handout.+IB0- No. I still have to work to
profit by it. But I don+IBk-t stand a chance without it.
                                         +IBQ-
One afternoon I was in my room making a CD when Bongani came over to pick up
his inventory. He saw me mixing songs on my computer.
    +IBw-This is insane,+IB0- he said. +IBw-Are you doing this live?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah.+IB0-
     +IBw-Trevor, I don+IBk-t think you understand+ADs- you+IBk-re sitting on a gold mine. We need
to do this for a crowd. You need to come to the township and start DJ+IBk-ing gigs. No
one has ever seen a DJ playing on a computer before.+IB0-
    Bongani lived in Alexandra. Where Soweto is a sprawling, government-
planned ghetto, Alexandra is a tiny, dense pocket of a shantytown, left over from
the pre-apartheid days. Rows and rows of cinder-block and corrugated-iron
shacks, practically stacked on top of one another. Its nickname is Gomorrah
because it has the wildest parties and the worst crimes.
     Street parties are the best thing about Alexandra. You get a tent, put it up in
the middle of the road, take over the street, and you+IBk-ve got a party. There+IBk-s no
formal invitations or guest list. You just tell a few people, word of mouth travels,
and a crowd appears. There are no permits, nothing like that. If you own a tent,
you have the right to throw a party in your street. Cars creep up to the intersection
and the driver will see the party blocking their way and shrug and make a U-turn.
Nobody gets upset. The only rule is that if you throw a party in front of
somebody+IBk-s house, they get to come and share your alcohol. The parties don+IBk-t end
until someone gets shot or a bottle gets broken on someone+IBk-s face. That+IBk-s how it
has to end+ADs- otherwise, it wasn+IBk-t a party.
     Back then, most DJs could spin for only a few hours+ADs- they were limited by the
number of vinyls they could buy. Since parties went all night, you might need five
or six DJs to keep the dancing going. But I had a massive hard drive stuffed with
MP3s, which is why Bongani was excited when he saw me mixing+IBQ-he saw a way to
corner the market.
    +IBw-How much music do you have?+IB0- he asked.
    +IBw-Winamp says I can play for a week.+IB0-
    +IBw-We+IBk-ll make a fortune.+IB0-
     Our first gig was a New Year+IBk-s Eve party the summer we graduated from
Sandringham. Bongani and I took my tower, my giant monitor, and all the cables
and the keyboard and the mouse. We loaded everything up in a minibus and
brought it over to Alex. We took over the street in front of his house, ran the
electricity out of his place, set up the computer, set up speakers, and borrowed a
tent, and people came. It was explosive. By midnight the whole street was packed
from one end to the other. Ours was the biggest New Year+IBk-s Eve party in Alexandra
that year, and to have the biggest party in Alexandra is no joke. All night, from far
and wide, people kept coming. The word spread: +IBw-There+IBk-s a light-skinned guy who
plays music on a computer. You+IBk-ve never seen anything like it.+IB0- I DJ+IBk-d by myself
until dawn. By then me and my friends were so drunk and exhausted that we
passed out on the lawn outside Bongani+IBk-s house. The party was so big it made our
reputation in the hood, instantly. Pretty soon we were getting booked all over.
    Which was a good thing.
    When Bongani and I graduated from high school, we couldn+IBk-t get jobs. There
were no jobs for us to get. The only ways I had to make money were pirating CDs
and DJ+IBk-ing parties, and now that I+IBk-d left Sandringham, the minibus drivers and
corner kids in Alexandra were the single biggest market for my CDs. It was also
where I was playing the most gigs, so to keep earning I naturally gravitated that
way. Most of the white kids I knew were taking a gap year. +IBw-I+IBk-m going to take a gap
year and go to Europe.+IB0- That+IBk-s what the white kids were saying. So I said, +IBw-I, too,
am going to take a gap year. I am going to take a year and go to the township and
hang out on the corner.+IB0- And that+IBk-s what I did.
    There was a low brick wall running down the middle of the road in front of
Bongani+IBk-s house in Alex, and every day Bongani and I and our crew would go sit
on the wall. I+IBk-d bring my CDs. We+IBk-d play music and practice dance moves. We
hustled CDs all day and DJ+IBk-d parties at night. We started getting booked for gigs in
other townships, other hoods.
     Thanks to my computer and modem I was getting exclusive tracks few people
had access to, but that created a problem for me. Sometimes I+IBk-d play the new
music at parties and people would stand around going, +IBw-What is this? How do you
dance to it?+IB0- For example, if a DJ plays a song like +IBw-Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)+IB0gFA-
yes, it+IBk-s a catchy song, but what is a whip? What is a nae nae? For that song to be
popular you have to know how to do the whip and the nae nae+ADs- new music works
at parties only if people know how to dance to it. Bongani decided we needed a
dance crew to show people the steps to the songs we were playing. Because we
spent our days doing nothing but listening to CDs and coming up with dance
moves, our crew from the corner already knew all the songs, so they became our
dancers. And hands down the best, most beautiful, most graceful dancer in the
crew was Bongani+IBk-s neighbor, Hitler.
    Hitler was a great friend of mine, and good Lord could that guy dance. He was
mesmerizing to watch. He had a looseness and a fluidity that defied physics+IBQ-
imagine a jellyfish if it could walk on land. Incredibly handsome, too, tall and lithe
and muscular, with beautiful, smooth skin, big teeth, and a great smile, always
laughing. And all he did was dance. He+IBk-d be up in the morning, blasting house
music or hip-hop, practicing moves the whole day.
     In the hood, everybody knows who the best dancer in the crew is. He+IBk-s like
your status symbol. When you+IBk-re poor you don+IBk-t have cars or nice clothes, but the
best dancer gets girls, so that+IBk-s the guy you want to roll with. Hitler was our guy.
There were parties with dance competitions. Kids from every neighborhood would
come and bring their best dancers. We+IBk-d always bring Hitler, and he almost always
won.
     When Bongani and I put together a routine for our dance crew, there was no
question who was going to be the star attraction. We built the whole set around
Hitler. I+IBk-d warm the crowd up with a few songs, then the dancers would come out
and do a couple of numbers. Once they+IBk-d gotten the party started, they+IBk-d fan out to
form a semicircle around the stage with a gap in the back for Hitler to enter. I+IBk-d
crank up Redman+IBk-s +IBw-Let+IBk-s Get Dirty+IB0- and start whipping the crowd up even more.
+IBw-Are you ready?+ACE- I can+IBk-t hear you+ACE- Let me hear you make some noise+ACEgHQ- People
would start screaming, and Hitler would jump into the middle of the semicircle
and the crowd would lose it. Hitler would do his thing while the guys circled
around him, shouting him on. +IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ-
And because this was hip-hop, the crew would do that thing where you shoot your
arm out in front of you with your palm flat, bopping it up and down to the beat.
+IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ- We+IBk-d have the whole crowd in a
frenzy, a thousand people in the street chanting along with their hands in the air.
+IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ-
                                         +IBQ-
Hitler, although an unusual name, is not unheard-of in South Africa. Part of it has
to do with the way a lot of black people pick names. Black people choose their
traditional names with great care+ADs- those are the names that have deeply personal
meanings. But from colonial times through the days of apartheid, black people in
South Africa were required to have an English or European name as well+IBQ-a name
that white people could pronounce, basically. So you had your English name, your
traditional name, and your last name: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. Nine times out
of ten, your European name was chosen at random, plucked from the Bible or
taken from a Hollywood celebrity or a famous politician in the news. I know guys
named after Mussolini and Napoleon. And, of course, Hitler.
     Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but really it+IBk-s a case of the West
reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved up Africa, put the black man
to work, and did not properly educate him. White people don+IBk-t talk to black
people. So why would black people know what+IBk-s going on in the white man+IBk-s
world? Because of that, many black people in South Africa don+IBk-t really know who
Hitler was. My own grandfather thought +IBw-a hitler+IB0- was a kind of army tank that
was helping the Germans win the war. Because that+IBk-s what he took from what he
heard on the news. For many black South Africans, the story of the war was that
there was someone called Hitler and he was the reason the Allies were losing the
war. This Hitler was so powerful that at some point black people had to go help
white people fight against him+IBQ-and if the white man has to stoop to ask the black
man for help fighting someone, that someone must be the toughest guy of all time.
So if you want your dog to be tough, you name your dog Hitler. If you want your
kid to be tough, you name your kid Hitler. There+IBk-s a good chance you+IBk-ve got an
uncle named Hitler. It+IBk-s just a thing.
    At Sandringham, we were taught more about World War II than the typical
black kids in the townships were, but only in a basic way. We weren+IBk-t taught to
think critically about Hitler and anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. We weren+IBk-t
taught, for instance, that the architects of apartheid were big fans of Hitler, that
the racist policies they put in place were inspired, in part, by the racist policies of
the Third Reich. We weren+IBk-t taught how to think about how Hitler related to the
world we lived in. We weren+IBk-t being taught to think, period. All we were taught
was that in 1939 Hitler invaded Poland and in 1941 he invaded the Soviet Union
and in 1943 he did something else. They+IBk-re just facts. Memorize them, write them
down for the test, and forget them.
     There is also this to consider: The name Hitler does not offend a black South
African because Hitler is not the worst thing a black South African can imagine.
Every country thinks their history is the most important, and that+IBk-s especially true
in the West. But if black South Africans could go back in time and kill one person,
Cecil Rhodes would come up before Hitler. If people in the Congo could go back in
time and kill one person, Belgium+IBk-s King Leopold would come way before Hitler. If
Native Americans could go back in time and kill one person, it would probably be
Christopher Columbus or Andrew Jackson.
     I often meet people in the West who insist that the Holocaust was the worst
atrocity in human history, without question. Yes, it was horrific. But I often
wonder, with African atrocities like in the Congo, how horrific were they? The
thing Africans don+IBk-t have that Jewish people do have is documentation. The Nazis
kept meticulous records, took pictures, made films. And that+IBk-s really what it comes
down to. Holocaust victims count because Hitler counted them. Six million people
killed. We can all look at that number and rightly be horrified. But when you read
through the history of atrocities against Africans, there are no numbers, only
guesses. It+IBk-s harder to be horrified by a guess. When Portugal and Belgium were
plundering Angola and the Congo, they weren+IBk-t counting the black people they
slaughtered. How many black people died harvesting rubber in the Congo? In the
gold and diamond mines of the Transvaal?
     So in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History. In
Africa he+IBk-s just another strongman from the history books. In all my time hanging
out with Hitler, I never once asked myself, +IBw-Why is his name Hitler?+IB0- His name
was Hitler because his mom named him Hitler.
                                          +IBQ-
Once Bongani and I added the dancers to our DJ sets, we blew up. We called our
group the Black and White Boys. The dancers were called the Springbok Boys. We
started getting booked everywhere. Successful black families were moving to the
suburbs, but their kids still wanted to have block parties and stay connected to the
culture of the townships, so they+IBk-d book us to play their parties. Word of mouth
traveled. Pretty soon we were getting booked more and more in the suburbs,
meeting white people, playing for white people.
    One kid we knew from the township, his mother was involved in creating
cultural programs for schools. In America they+IBk-d be called +IBw-diversity programs.+IB0-
They were springing up all over South Africa because we were supposed to be
learning about and embracing one another in this post-apartheid era. This kid+IBk-s
mom asked us if we wanted to play at a cultural day at some school in Linksfield,
the wealthy suburb south of Sandringham where my pal Teddy had lived. There
was going to be all sorts of different dancing and music, and everyone was going to
come together and hang out and be cultural. She offered to pay, so we said sure.
She sent us the information with the time and place and the name of the school:
the King David School. A Jewish school.
    The day of the event, we booked a minibus, loaded it up with our gear, and
drove over. Once we arrived we waited in the back of the school+IBk-s assembly hall
and watched the acts that went onstage before us, different groups took their turns
performing, flamenco dancers, Greek dancers, traditional Zulu musicians. Then
we were up. We were billed as the Hip Hop Pantsula Dancers+IBQ-the South African
B-Boys. We set up our sound system onstage. I looked out, and the whole hall was
nothing but Jewish kids in their yarmulkes, ready to party.
       I got on the mic. +IBw-Are you ready to rock out?+ACEgHQ-
       +IBw-Yeahhhhhh+ACEgHQ-
       +IBw-Make some noise+ACEgHQ-
       +IBw-Yeahhhhhh+ACEgHQ-
    I started playing. The bass was bumping, my crew was dancing, and everyone
was having a great time. The teachers, the chaperones, the parents, hundreds of
kids+IBQ-they were all dancing like crazy. Our set was scheduled for fifteen minutes,
and at the ten-minute mark came the moment for me to play +IBw-Let+IBk-s Get Dirty,+IB0-
bring out my star dancer, and shut shit down.
       I started the song, the dancers fanned out in their semicircle, and I got on the
mic.
       +IBw-Are you guys ready?+ACEgHQ-
       +IBw-Yeahhhhhh+ACEgHQ-
       +IBw-You guys are not ready+ACE- Are you ready?+ACEgHQ-
       +IBw-Yeeeaaahhhhhhhh+ACEgHQ-
   +IBw-All right+ACE- Give it up and make some noise for HIIIIIITTTTLLLLEERRRRR?-
RRRRR?+ACEAIQAhIB0-
     Hitler jumped out to the middle of the circle and started killing it. The guys
around him were all chanting, +IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ-
They had their arms out in front of them, bouncing to the rhythm. +IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go
Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ- And I was right there on the mic leading them
along. +IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ-
     The whole room stopped. No one was dancing. The teachers, the chaperones,
the parents, the hundreds of Jewish kids in their yarmulkes+IBQ-they froze and stared
aghast at us up on the stage. I was oblivious. So was Hitler. We kept going. For a
good thirty seconds the only sound in the room was the beat of the music and me
on the mic yelling, +IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Put your hands in the air
for Hitler, yo+ACEgHQ-
     A teacher ran up behind me and yanked the plug for my system out of the
wall. The hall went dead silent, and she turned on me and she was livid. +IBw-How
dare you?+ACE- This is disgusting+ACE- You horrible, disgusting vile creature+ACE- How dare
you?+ACEgHQ-
     My mind was racing, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then it
clicked. Hitler had a special dance move called o spana va. It means +IBw-where you
work+IB0- and it was very sexual: His hips would gyrate and thrust, like he was fucking
the air. That was the move he was doing at the moment the teacher ran out, so
clearly the dance was the thing she found so disgusting. But this was a move that
African people do all the time. It+IBk-s a part of our culture. Here we were sharing our
culture for a cultural day, and this woman was calling us disgusting. She was
offended, and I was offended by her taking offense.
    +IBw-Lady,+IB0- I said, +IBw-I think you need to calm down.+IB0-
    +IBw-I will not calm down+ACE- How dare you come here and insult us?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-This is not insulting anyone. This is who we are+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Get out of here+ACE- You people are disgusting.+IB0-
     And there it was. You people. Now I saw what the deal was: This lady was
racist. She couldn+IBk-t see black men dancing suggestively and not get pissed off. As I
started packing up my gear, we kept arguing.
    +IBw-Listen, lady. We+IBk-re free now. We+IBk-re gonna do what we+IBk-re gonna do. You can+IBk-t
stop us.+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-ll have you know that my people stopped people like you before, and we can
stop you again.+IB0-
     She was talking, of course, about stopping the Nazis in World War II, but
that+IBk-s not what I was hearing. Jews in South Africa are just white people. All I was
hearing was some white lady shouting about how white people beat us before and
they+IBk-ll beat us again. I said, +IBw-You will never stop us again, lady+IB0gFA-and here+IBk-s where
I played the trump card+IBQgHA-You+IBk-ll never stop us, because now we have Nelson
Mandela on our side+ACE- And he told us we can do this+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-What?+ACEgHQ-
    She was so confused. I+IBk-d had it. I started cussing her out. +IBw-Fuck you, lady.
Fuck your program. Fuck your school. Fuck your whole people. Let+IBk-s go, guys+ACE-
We+IBk-re out+ACEgHQ-
    We didn+IBk-t walk out of that school. We danced out. We danced down the street
pumping our fists in the air. +IBw-Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACE- Go Hit-ler+ACEgHQ-
Because Hitler had shut shit down. Hitler had the most gangster dance moves
ever, and those white people didn+IBk-t know what hit them.
A lexandra was a farm originally named for the wife of the white man who owned it. Like
Sophiatown and other black spots populating white areas before apartheid, Alex started out as
a squatter settlement where blacks gathered and lived when coming to Johannesburg to find
work. What was unique about Alex is that this farmer sold plots of land to some of the black
tenants in the time before it was illegal for blacks to own property. So while Sophiatown and
other black ghettos were razed and rebuilt as white suburbs, Alex fought and held on and
asserted its right to exist. Wealthy white suburbs like Sandton grew around it, but Alex
remained. More squatters came and more squatters came, putting up makeshift shacks and
shanties. They look like the slums in Mumbai or the favelas in Brazil. The first time I saw the
favelas in Rio I said, +IBw-Yeah, that+IBk-s Alexandra, but on a hill.+IB0-
    Soweto was beautiful because, after democracy, you watched Soweto grow. Soweto has
become a proper city unto itself. People went from three-room houses to five-room houses to
three-bedroom houses with garages. There was room to grow because the piece of land from
the government gave you something to build on. Alexandra can+IBk-t do that. Alex can+IBk-t get any
bigger, because it+IBk-s pinned in on all sides, and it can+IBk-t build up, because it+IBk-s mostly shacks.
     When democracy came, people flooded into Alex from the homelands, building new
shacks in the backyards of other shacks with still more shacks attached to the backside of
those shacks, growing more dense and more compressed, leaving close to 200,000 people
living in a few square kilometers. Even if you go back today, Alex hasn+IBk-t changed. It can+IBk-t
change. It+IBk-s physically impossible for it to change. It can only be what it is.
                                                 THE CHEESE BOYS



My friend Bongani was a short, bald, super-buff guy. He wasn+IBk-t always that way.
His whole life he+IBk-d been skinny, and then a bodybuilding magazine found its way
into his hands and changed his life. Bongani was one of those people who brought
out the best in everybody. He was that friend who believed in you and saw the
potential in you that nobody else did, which was why so many of the township kids
gravitated toward him, and why I gravitated toward him as well. Bongani was
always popular, but his reputation really took off when he beat up one of the more
infamous bullies in the school. That cemented his status as sort of the leader and
protector of the township kids.
     Bongani lived in Alex, but I never visited him there while we were still in
school+ADs- he+IBk-d always come to my house in Highlands North. I+IBk-d been to Alex a few
times, for brief visits, but I+IBk-d never spent any real time there. I+IBk-d never been there
at night, let+IBk-s put it that way. Going to Alex during the day is different from going
there at night. The place was nicknamed Gomorrah for a reason.
    One day after school, not long before we matriculated, Bongani walked up to
me on the quad.
    +IBw-Hey, let+IBk-s go to the hood,+IB0- he said.
    +IBw-The hood?+IB0-
     At first I had no idea what he was talking about. I knew the word +IBw-hood+IB0- from
rap songs, and I knew the different townships where black people lived, but I had
never used the one to describe the other.
     The walls of apartheid were coming down just as American hip-hop was
blowing up, and hip-hop made it cool to be from the hood. Before, living in a
township was something to be ashamed of+ADs- it was the bottom of the bottom. Then
we had movies like Boyz n the Hood and Menace II Society, and they made the
hood look cool. The characters in those movies, in the songs, they owned it. Kids
in the townships started doing the same, wearing their identity as a badge of
honor: You were no longer from the township+IBQ-you were from the hood. Being
from Alex gave you way more street cred than living in Highlands North. So when
Bongani said, +IBw-Let+IBk-s go to the hood,+IB0- I was curious about what he meant. I wanted
to find out more.
                                         +IBQ-
When Bongani took me to Alex we entered as most people do, from the Sandton
side. You ride through one of the richest neighborhoods in Johannesburg, past
palatial mansions and huge money. Then you go through the industrial belt of
Wynberg that cordons off the rich and white from the poor and black. At the
entrance to Alex there+IBk-s the huge minibus rank and the bus station. It+IBk-s the same
bustling, chaotic third-world marketplace you see in James Bond and Jason
Bourne movies. It+IBk-s Grand Central Station but outdoors. Everything+IBk-s dynamic.
Everything+IBk-s in motion. Nothing feels like it was there yesterday, and nothing feels
like it will be there tomorrow, but every day it looks exactly the same.
    Right next to the minibus rank, of course, is a KFC. That+IBk-s one thing about
South Africa: There+IBk-s always a KFC. KFC found the black people. KFC did not play
games. They were in the hood before McDonald+IBk-s, before Burger King, before
anyone. KFC was like, +IBw-Yo, we+IBk-re here for you.+IB0-
    Once you go past the minibus rank, you+IBk-re in Alex proper. I+IBk-ve been in few
places where there+IBk-s an electricity like there is in Alex. It+IBk-s a hive of constant
human activity, all day long, people coming and going, gangsters hustling, guys on
the corner doing nothing, kids running around. There+IBk-s nowhere for all that
energy to go, no mechanism for it to dissipate, so it erupts periodically in epic acts
of violence and crazy parties. One minute it+IBk-ll be a placid afternoon, people
hanging out, doing their thing, and next thing you know there+IBk-s a cop car chasing
gangsters, flying through the streets, a gun battle going off, helicopters circling
overhead. Then, ten minutes later, it+IBk-s like it never happened+IBQ-everyone+IBk-s back to
hanging out, back to the hustle, coming and going, running around.
     Alex is laid out on a grid, a series of avenues. The streets are paved, but the
sidewalks are mostly dirt. The color scheme is cinder block and corrugated iron,
gray and dark gray, punctuated by bright splashes of color. Someone+IBk-s painted a
wall lime green, or there+IBk-s a bright-red sign above a takeaway shop, or maybe
somebody+IBk-s picked up a bright-blue piece of sheet metal just by luck. There+IBk-s little
in the way of basic sanitation. Trash is everywhere, typically a garbage fire going
down some side street. There+IBk-s always something burning in the hood.
      As you walk, there+IBk-s every smell you can imagine. People are cooking, eating
takeaways in the streets. Some family has a shack that+IBk-s jury-rigged onto the back
of someone else+IBk-s shack, and they don+IBk-t have any running water, so they+IBk-ve bathed
in a bucket from the outdoor tap and then dumped the dirty water in the street,
where it runs into the river of sewerage that+IBk-s already there because the water
system has backed up again. There+IBk-s a guy fixing cars who thinks he knows what
he+IBk-s doing, but he doesn+IBk-t. He+IBk-s dumping old motor oil into the street, and now the
oil is combining with the dirty bathwater to make a river of filth running down the
street. There+IBk-s probably a goat hanging around+IBQ-there+IBk-s always a goat. As you+IBk-re
walking, sound washes over you, the steady thrum of human activity, people
talking in a dozen different languages, chatting, haggling, arguing. There+IBk-s music
playing constantly. You+IBk-ve got traditional South African music coming from one
corner, someone blasting Dolly Parton from the next corner, and somebody
driving past pumping the Notorious B.I.G.
    The hood was a complete sensory overload for me, but within the chaos there
was order, a system, a social hierarchy based on where you lived. First Avenue was
not cool at all because it was right next to the commotion of the minibus rank.
Second Avenue was nice because it had semi-houses that were built when there
was still some sort of formal settlement going on. Third, Fourth, and Fifth
Avenues were nicer+IBQ-for the township. These were the established families, the old
money. Then from Sixth Avenue on down it got really shitty, more shacks and
shanties. There were some schools, a few soccer fields. There were a couple of
hostels, giant projects built by the government for housing migrant workers. You
never wanted to go there. That+IBk-s where the serious gangsters were. You only went
there if you needed to buy an AK-47.
      After Twentieth Avenue you hit the Jukskei River, and on the far side of that,
across the Roosevelt Street Bridge, was East Bank, the newest, nicest part of the
hood. East Bank was where the government had gone in, cleared out the squatters
and their shacks, and started to build actual homes. It was still low-income
housing, but decent two-bedroom houses with tiny yards. The families who lived
there had a bit of money and usually sent their kids out of the hood to better
schools, like Sandringham. Bongani+IBk-s parents lived in East Bank, at the corner of
Roosevelt and Springbok Crescent, and after walking from the minibus rank
through the hood, we wound up there, hanging around outside his house on the
low brick wall down the middle of Springbok Crescent, doing nothing, shooting
the shit. I didn+IBk-t know it then, but I was about to spend the next three years of my
life hanging out at that very spot.
                                         +IBQ-
I graduated from high school when I was seventeen, and by that point life at home
had become toxic because of my stepfather. I didn+IBk-t want to be there anymore, and
my mom agreed that I should move out. She helped me move to a cheap, roach-
infested flat in a building down the road. My plan, insofar as I had one, was to go
to university to be a computer programmer, but we couldn+IBk-t afford the tuition. I
needed to make money. The only way I knew how to make money was selling
pirated CDs, and one of the best places to sell CDs was in the hood, because that+IBk-s
where the minibus rank was. Minibus drivers were always looking for new songs
because having good music was something they used to attract customers.
      Another nice thing about the hood was that it+IBk-s super cheap. You can get by
on next to nothing. There+IBk-s a meal you can get in the hood called a kota. It+IBk-s a
quarter loaf of bread. You scrape out the bread, then you fill it with fried potatoes,
a slice of baloney, and some pickled mango relish called achar. That costs a couple
of rand. The more money you have, the more upgrades you can buy. If you have a
bit more money you can throw in a hot dog. If you have a bit more than that, you
can throw in a proper sausage, like a bratwurst, or maybe a fried egg. The biggest
one, with all the upgrades, is enough to feed three people.
     For us, the ultimate upgrade was to throw on a slice of cheese. Cheese was
always the thing because it was so expensive. Forget the gold standard+IBQ-the hood
operated on the cheese standard. Cheese on anything was money. If you got a
burger, that was cool, but if you got a cheeseburger, that meant you had more
money than a guy who just got a hamburger. Cheese on a sandwich, cheese in your
fridge, that meant you were living the good life. In any township in South Africa, if
you had a bit of money, people would say, +IBw-Oh, you+IBk-re a cheese boy.+IB0- In essence:
You+IBk-re not really hood because your family has enough money to buy cheese.
     In Alex, because Bongani and his crew lived in East Bank, they were
considered cheese boys. Ironically, because they lived on the first street just over
the river, they were looked down on as the scruff of East Bank and the kids in the
nicer houses higher up in East Bank were the cheesier cheese boys. Bongani and
his crew would never admit to being cheese boys. They would insist, +IBw-We+IBk-re not
cheese. We+IBk-re hood.+IB0- But then the real hood guys would say, +IBw-Eh, you+IBk-re not hood.
You+IBk-re cheese.+IB0- +IBw-We+IBk-re not cheese,+IB0- Bongani+IBk-s guys would say, pointing further up
East Bank. +IBw-They+IBk-re cheese.+IB0- It was all a bunch of ridiculous posturing about who
was hood and who was cheese.
    Bongani was the leader of his crew, the guy who got everyone together and
got things moving. Then there was Mzi, Bongani+IBk-s henchman. Small guy, just
wanted to tag along, be in the mix. Bheki was the drinks man, always finding us
booze and always coming up with an excuse to drink. Then there was Kakoatse.
We called him G. Mr. Nice Guy. All G was interested in was women. If women
were in the mix, he was in the game. Then, finally, there was Hitler, the life of the
party. Hitler just wanted to dance.
     Cheese boys were in a uniquely fucked situation when apartheid ended. It is
one thing to be born in the hood and know that you will never leave the hood. But
the cheese boy has been shown the world outside. His family has done okay. They
have a house. They+IBk-ve sent him to a decent school+ADs- maybe he+IBk-s even matriculated.
He has been given more potential, but he has not been given more opportunity.
He has been given an awareness of the world that is out there, but he has not been
given the means to reach it.
     The unemployment rate, technically speaking, was +IBw-lower+IB0- in South Africa
during apartheid, which makes sense. There was slavery+IBQ-that+IBk-s how everyone was
employed. When democracy came, everyone had to be paid a minimum wage. The
cost of labor went up, and suddenly millions of people were out of work. The
unemployment rate for young black men post-apartheid shot up, sometimes as
high as 50 percent. What happens to a lot of guys is they finish high school and
they can+IBk-t afford university, and even little retail jobs can be hard to come by when
you+IBk-re from the hood and you look and talk a certain way. So, for many young men
in South Africa+IBk-s townships, freedom looks like this: Every morning they wake up,
maybe their parents go to work or maybe not. Then they go outside and chill on
the corner the whole day, talking shit. They+IBk-re free, they+IBk-ve been taught how to
fish, but no one will give them a fishing rod.
                                          +IBQ-
One of the first things I learned in the hood is that there is a very fine line between
civilian and criminal. We like to believe we live in a world of good guys and bad
guys, and in the suburbs it+IBk-s easy to believe that, because getting to know a career
criminal in the suburbs is a difficult thing. But then you go to the hood and you see
there are so many shades in between.
     In the hood, gangsters were your friends and neighbors. You knew them. You
talked to them on the corner, saw them at parties. They were a part of your world.
You knew them from before they became gangsters. It wasn+IBk-t, +IBw-Hey, that+IBk-s a crack
dealer.+IB0- It was, +IBw-Oh, little Jimmy+IBk-s selling crack now.+IB0- The weird thing about these
gangsters was that they were all, at a glance, identical. They drove the same red
sports car. They dated the same beautiful eighteen-year-old girls. It was strange. It
was like they didn+IBk-t have personalities+ADs- they shared a personality. One could be the
other, and the other could be the one. They+IBk-d each studied how to be that
gangster.
     In the hood, even if you+IBk-re not a hardcore criminal, crime is in your life in
some way or another. There are degrees of it. It+IBk-s everyone from the mom buying
some food that fell off the back of a truck to feed her family, all the way up to the
gangs selling military-grade weapons and hardware. The hood made me realize
that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn+IBk-t do:
crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support
and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and
opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime
doesn+IBk-t discriminate.
     My life of crime started off small, selling pirated CDs on the corner. That in
itself was a crime, and today I feel like I owe all these artists money for stealing
their music, but by hood standards it didn+IBk-t even qualify as illegal. At the time it
never occurred to any of us that we were doing anything wrong+IBQ-if copying CDs is
wrong, why would they make CD writers?
     The garage of Bongani+IBk-s house opened up onto Springbok Cresent. Every
morning we+IBk-d open the doors, run an extension cord out into the street, set up a
table, and play music. People would walk by and ask, +IBw-What is that? Can I get one,
please?+IB0- Our corner was also where a lot of minibus drivers ended their routes and
turned around to loop back to the minibus rank. They+IBk-d swing by, place an order,
come back, pick it up. Swing by, place an order, come back, pick it up. We spent
our whole day running out to them, going back to the garage to make more mixes,
and going back out to sell. There was a converted shipping container around the
corner where we+IBk-d hang out when we got tired of the wall. It had a pay phone
installed inside that we+IBk-d use to call people. When things were slow we+IBk-d wander
back and forth between the container and the wall, talking and hanging out with
the other people with nothing to do in the middle of the day. We+IBk-d talk to drug
dealers, talk to gangsters. Every now and then the cops would come crashing
through. A day in the life of the hood. Next day, same thing.
    Selling slowly evolved into hustling because Bongani saw all the angles and
knew how to exploit them. Like Tom, Bongani was a hustler. But where Tom was
only about the short con, Bongani had schemes: If we do this, we get that, then we
can flip that for the other thing, which gives us the leverage we need to get
something bigger. Some minibus drivers couldn+IBk-t pay up front, for example. +IBw-I
don+IBk-t have the money, because I+IBk-ve just started my shift,+IB0- they+IBk-d say. +IBw-But I need
new music. Can I owe you guys some form of credit? I+IBk-ll owe you a ride. I+IBk-ll pay
you at the end of my shift, at the end of the week?+IB0- So we started letting drivers
buy on credit, charging them a bit of interest.
     We started making more money. Never more than a few hundred, maybe a
thousand rand at a time, but it was all cash on hand. Bongani was quick to realize
the position we were in. Cash is the one thing everyone in the hood needs.
Everyone+IBk-s looking for a short-term loan for something, to pay a bill or pay a fine
or just hold things together. People started coming to us and asking for money.
Bongani would cut a deal, and then he+IBk-d come to me. +IBw-Yo, we+IBk-re going to make a
deal with this guy. We+IBk-re going to loan him a hundred, and he+IBk-s going to give us
back one-twenty at the end of the week.+IB0- I+IBk-d say okay. Then the guy would come
back and give us 120 rand. Then we did it again. Then we did it some more. We
started to double our money, then triple our money.
    Cash gave us leverage in the hood+IBk-s barter economy as well. It+IBk-s common
knowledge that if you+IBk-re standing at a corner of a main street in the hood,
somebody+IBk-s going to try to sell you something. +IBw-Yo, yo, yo, man. You want some
weed?+IB0- +IBw-You wanna buy a VCR?+IB0- +IBw-You wanna buy a DVD player?+IB0- +IBw-Yo, I+IBk-m selling
a TV.+IB0- That+IBk-s just how it works.
    Let+IBk-s say we see two guys haggling on the corner, a crackhead trying to sell a
DVD player and some working dude who wants it but doesn+IBk-t have the money
because he hasn+IBk-t got his wages yet. They+IBk-re going back and forth, but the
crackhead wants the money now. Crackheads don+IBk-t wait. There+IBk-s no layaway plan
with a crackhead. So Bongani steps in and takes the working guy aside.
    +IBw-Look, I understand you can+IBk-t pay for the DVD player now,+IB0- Bongani says.
+IBw-But how much are you willing to pay for it?+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-ll pay one-twenty,+IB0- he says.
    +IBw-Okay, cool.+IB0-
    Then Bongani takes the crackhead aside.
    +IBw-How much do you want for the DVD player?+IB0-
    +IBw-I want one-forty.+IB0-
     +IBw-Okay, listen. You+IBk-re a crackhead. This is a stolen DVD player. I+IBk-m going to
give you fifty.+IB0-
    The crackhead protests a bit, but then he takes the money because he+IBk-s a
crackhead and it+IBk-s cash and crack is all about the now. Then Bongani goes back to
the working guy.
    +IBw-All right. We+IBk-ll do one-twenty. Here+IBk-s your DVD player. It+IBk-s yours.+IB0-
    +IBw-But I don+IBk-t have the one-twenty.+IB0-
     +IBw-It+IBk-s cool. You can take it now, only instead of one-twenty you give us one-
forty when you get your wages.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay.+IB0-
     So now we+IBk-ve invested 50 rand with the crackhead and that gets us 140 from
the working guy. But Bongani would see a way to flip it and grow it again. Let+IBk-s say
this guy who bought the DVD player worked at a shoe store.
    +IBw-How much do you pay for a pair of Nikes with your staff discount?+IB0- Bongani
would ask.
    +IBw-I can get a pair of Nikes for one-fifty.+IB0-
     +IBw-Okay, instead of you giving us one-forty, we+IBk-ll give you ten and you get us a
pair of Nikes with your discount.+IB0-
     So now this guy+IBk-s walking away with a DVD player and 10 rand in his pocket.
He+IBk-s feeling like he got a good deal. He brings us the Nikes and then we go to one
of the cheesier cheese boys up in East Bank and we say, +IBw-Yo, dude, we know you
want the new Jordans. They+IBk-re three hundred in the shops. We+IBk-ll sell them to you
for two hundred.+IB0- We sell him the shoes, and now we+IBk-ve gone and turned 60 rand
into 200.
    That+IBk-s the hood. Someone+IBk-s always buying, someone+IBk-s always selling, and the
hustle is about trying to be in the middle of that whole thing. None of it was legal.
Nobody knew where anything came from. The guy who got us Nikes, did he really
have a +IBw-staff discount+IB0-? You don+IBk-t know. You don+IBk-t ask. It+IBk-s just, +IBw-Hey, look what I
found+IB0- and +IBw-Cool, how much do you want?+IB0- That+IBk-s the international code.
     At first I didn+IBk-t know not to ask. I remember one time we bought a car stereo
or something like that.
    +IBw-But who did this belong to?+IB0- I said.
    +IBw-Eh, don+IBk-t worry about it,+IB0- one of the guys told me. +IBw-White people have
insurance.+IB0-
    +IBw-Insurance?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, when white people lose stuff they have insurance policies that pay
them cash for what they+IBk-ve lost, so it+IBk-s like they+IBk-ve lost nothing.+IB0-
    +IBw-Oh, okay,+IB0- I said. +IBw-Sounds nice.+IB0-
    And that was as far as we ever thought about it: When white people lose stuff
they get money, just another nice perk of being white.
    It+IBk-s easy to be judgmental about crime when you live in a world wealthy
enough to be removed from it. But the hood taught me that everyone has different
notions of right and wrong, different definitions of what constitutes crime, and
what level of crime they+IBk-re willing to participate in. If a crackhead comes through
and he+IBk-s got a crate of Corn Flakes boxes he+IBk-s stolen out of the back of a
supermarket, the poor mom isn+IBk-t thinking, I+IBk-m aiding and abetting a criminal by
buying these Corn Flakes. No. She+IBk-s thinking, My family needs food and this guy
has Corn Flakes, and she buys the Corn Flakes.
    My own mother, my super-religious, law-abiding mother who used to shit on
me about breaking the rules and learning to behave, I+IBk-ll never forget one day I
came home and in the kitchen was a giant box of frozen burger patties, like two
hundred of them, from a takeaway place called Black Steer. A burger at Black
Steer cost at least 20 rand.
    +IBw-What the hell is this?+IB0- I said.
    +IBw-Oh, some guy at work had these and was selling them,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I got a
great discount.+IB0-
    +IBw-But where did he get it from?+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t know. He said he knew somebody who+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mom, he stole it.+IB0-
    +IBw-We don+IBk-t know that.+IB0-
     +IBw-We do know that. Where the hell is some guy going to get all of these burger
patties from, randomly?+IB0-
    Of course, we ate the burgers. Then we thanked God for the meal.
    When Bongani first said to me, +IBw-Let+IBk-s go to the hood,+IB0- I thought we were
going to sell CDs and DJ parties in the hood. It turned out that we were selling
CDs and DJing parties in order to capitalize a payday-lending and pawnshop
operation in the hood. Very quickly that became our core business.
     Every day in the hood was the same. I+IBk-d wake up early. Bongani would meet
me at my flat and we+IBk-d catch a minibus to Alex with my computer, carrying the
giant tower and the giant, heavy monitor the whole way. We+IBk-d set it up in
Bongani+IBk-s garage, and start the first batch of CDs. Then we+IBk-d walk. We+IBk-d go down
to the corner of Nineteenth and Roosevelt for breakfast. When you+IBk-re trying to
stretch your money, food is where you have to be careful. You have to plan or
you+IBk-ll eat your profits. So every morning for breakfast we eat vetkoek, which is
fried dough, basically. Those were cheap, like 50 cents a pop. We could buy a
bunch of those and have enough energy to sustain us until later on in the day.
    Then we+IBk-d sit on the corner and eat. While we ate, we+IBk-d be picking up orders
from the minibus drivers as they went past. After that we+IBk-d go back to Bongani+IBk-s
garage, listen to music, lift weights, make the CDs. Around ten or eleven, the
drivers would start coming back from their morning routes. We+IBk-d take the CDs
and head out to the corner for them to pick up their stuff. Then we+IBk-d just be on the
corner, hanging out, meeting characters, seeing who came by, seeing where the
day was going to take us. A guy needs this. A guy+IBk-s selling that. You never knew
what it was going to be.
     There was always a big rush of business at lunch. We+IBk-d be all over Alexandra,
hitting different shops and corners, making deals with everyone. We+IBk-d get free
rides from the minibus drivers because we+IBk-d hop in with them and use it as an
opportunity to talk about what music they needed, but secretly we were riding
with the guy for free. +IBw-Hey, we want to collect orders. We+IBk-ll talk to you while you
drive. What do you need? What music are you looking for? Do you need the new
Maxwell? Okay, we got the new Maxwell. Okay, we+IBk-ll talk to you later. We+IBk-ll jump
out here.+IB0- Then we+IBk-d hop on another ride going wherever we were going next.
    After lunch, business would die down, and that+IBk-s when we+IBk-d get our lunch,
usually the cheapest thing we could afford, like a smiley with some maize meal. A
smiley is a goat+IBk-s head. They+IBk-re boiled and covered with chili pepper. We call them
smileys because when you+IBk-re done eating all the meat off it, the goat looks like it+IBk-s
smiling at you from the plate. The cheeks and the tongue are quite delicious, but
the eyes are disgusting. They pop in your mouth. You put the eyeball into your
mouth and you bite it, and it+IBk-s just a ball of pus that pops. It has no crunch. It has
no chew. It has no flavor that is appetizing in any way.
     After lunch we+IBk-d head back to the garage, relax, sleep off the meal, and make
more CDs. In the afternoons we+IBk-d see a lot of moms. Moms loved us. They were
some of our best customers. Since moms run the household, they+IBk-re the ones
looking to buy that box of soap that fell off the back of the truck, and they were
more likely to buy it from us than from some crackhead. Dealing with crackheads
is unpleasant. We were upstanding, well-spoken East Bank boys. We could even
charge a premium because we added that layer of respectability to the transaction.
Moms are also often the most in need of short-term loans, to pay for this or that
for the family. Again, they+IBk-d rather deal with us than with some gangster loan
shark. Moms knew we weren+IBk-t going to break anyone+IBk-s legs if they couldn+IBk-t pay.
We didn+IBk-t believe in that. Also we weren+IBk-t capable of it+IBQ-let+IBk-s not forget that part.
But that+IBk-s where Bongani+IBk-s brilliance came in. He always knew what a person
could provide pending their failure to pay.
    We made some of the craziest trades. Moms in the hood are protective of their
daughters, especially if their daughters are pretty. In Alex there were girls who got
locked up. They went to school, came straight home, and went straight into the
house. They weren+IBk-t allowed to leave. Boys weren+IBk-t allowed to talk to them, weren+IBk-t
even allowed to hang around the house+IBQ-none of that. Some guy was always going
on about some locked-away girl: +IBw-She+IBk-s so beautiful. I+IBk-ll do anything to get with
her.+IB0- But he couldn+IBk-t. Nobody could.
     Then that mom would need a loan. Once we lent her the money, until she
paid us back she couldn+IBk-t chase us away from her house. We+IBk-d go by and hang out,
chat, make small talk. The daughter would be right there, but the mom couldn+IBk-t
say, +IBw-Don+IBk-t talk to those boys+ACEgHQ- The loan gave us access to establish a relationship
with the mom. We+IBk-d get invited to stay for dinner. Once the mom knew we were
nice, upstanding guys, she+IBk-d agree to let us take her daughter to a party as long as
we promised to get her home safely. So then we+IBk-d go to the guy who+IBk-d been so
desperate to meet the daughter.
    +IBw-Hey, let+IBk-s make a deal. We+IBk-ll bring the girl to your party and you get to hang
out with her. How much can you give us?+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t have money,+IB0- he+IBk-d say, +IBw-but I have some cases of beer.+IB0-
     +IBw-Okay, so tonight we+IBk-re going to this party. You give us two cases of beer for
the party.+IB0-
    +IBw-Cool.+IB0-
     Then we+IBk-d go to the party. We+IBk-d invite the girl, who was usually thrilled to
escape her mother+IBk-s prison. The guy would bring the beer, he+IBk-d get to hang out
with the girl, we+IBk-d write off the mom+IBk-s debt to show her our gratitude, and we+IBk-d
make our money back selling the beer. There was always a way to make it work.
And often that was the most fun part: working the angles, solving the puzzle,
seeing what goes where, who needs what, whom we can connect with who can
then get us the money.
    At the peak of our operation we probably had around 10,000 rand in capital.
We had loans going out and interest coming in. We had our stockpile of Jordans
and DVD players we+IBk-d bought to resell. We also had to buy blank CDs, hire
minibuses to go to our DJ gigs, feed five guys three times a day. We kept track of
everything on the computer. Having lived in my mom+IBk-s world, I knew how to do
spreadsheets. We had a Microsoft Excel document laid out: everybody+IBk-s name,
how much they owed, when they paid, when they didn+IBk-t pay.
     After work was when business started to pick up. Minibus drivers picking up
one last order, men coming home from work. The men weren+IBk-t looking for soap
and Corn Flakes. They wanted the gear+IBQ-DVD players, CD players, PlayStation
games. More guys would come through selling stuff, too, because they+IBk-d been out
hustling and stealing all day. There+IBk-d be a guy selling a cellphone, a guy selling
some leather jackets, a guy selling shoes. There was this one dude who looked like
a black version of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. He+IBk-d always come by at the end
of his shift with the most random useless crap, like an electric toothbrush without
the charger. One time he brought us an electric razor.
    +IBw-What the hell is this?+IB0-
    +IBw-It+IBk-s an electric razor?+IB0-
    +IBw-An electric razor? We+IBk-re black. Do you know what these things do to our
skin? Do you see anyone around here who can use an electric razor?+IB0-
    We never knew where he was getting this stuff from. Because you don+IBk-t ask.
Eventually we pieced it together, though: He worked at the airport. It was all crap
he was boosting from people+IBk-s luggage.
     Slowly the rush would start to taper off and we+IBk-d wind down. We+IBk-d make our
last collections, go over our CD stock, balance our accounts. If there was a party to
DJ that night we+IBk-d start getting ready for that. Otherwise, we+IBk-d buy a few beers
and sit around and drink, talk about the day, listen to the gunshots in the distance.
Gunshots went off every night, and we+IBk-d always try to guess what kind of gun it
was. +IBw-That+IBk-s a nine-millimeter.+IB0- Usually there+IBk-d be a police chase, cop cars flying
through after some guy with a stolen car. Then everyone would go home for
dinner with their families. I+IBk-d take my computer, get back in a minibus, ride home,
sleep, and then come back and do it all again the next day.
                                         +IBQ-
A year passed. Then two. I had stopped planning for school, and was no closer to
having the money to enroll.
     The tricky thing about the hood is that you+IBk-re always working, working,
working, and you feel like something+IBk-s happening, but really nothing+IBk-s happening
at all. I was out there every day from seven a.m. to seven p.m., and every day it
was: How do we turn ten rand into twenty? How do we turn twenty into fifty?
How do I turn fifty into a hundred? At the end of the day we+IBk-d spend it on food
and maybe some beers, and then we+IBk-d go home and come back and it was: How do
we turn ten into twenty? How do we turn twenty into fifty? It was a whole day+IBk-s
work to flip that money. You had to be walking, be moving, be thinking. You had
to get to a guy, find a guy, meet a guy. There were many days we+IBk-d end up back at
zero, but I always felt like I+IBk-d been very productive.
    Hustling is to work what surfing the Internet is to reading. If you add up how
much you read in a year on the Internet+IBQ-tweets, Facebook posts, lists+IBQ-you+IBk-ve
read the equivalent of a shit ton of books, but in fact you+IBk-ve read no books in a
year. When I look back on it, that+IBk-s what hustling was. It+IBk-s maximal effort put into
minimal gain. It+IBk-s a hamster wheel. If I+IBk-d put all that energy into studying I+IBk-d have
earned an MBA. Instead I was majoring in hustling, something no university
would give me a degree for.
     When I first went into Alex, I was drawn by the electricity and the excitement
of it, but more important, I was accepted there, more so than I+IBk-d been in high
school or anywhere else. When I first showed up, a couple of people raised an
eyebrow. +IBw-Who+IBk-s this colored kid?+IB0- But the hood doesn+IBk-t judge. If you want to be
there, you can be there. Because I didn+IBk-t live in the hood I was technically an
outsider in the hood, but for the first time in my life I didn+IBk-t feel like one.
     The hood is also a low-stress, comfortable life. All your mental energy goes
into getting by, so you don+IBk-t have to ask yourself any of the big questions. Who am
I? Who am I supposed to be? Am I doing enough? In the hood you can be a forty-
year-old man living in your mom+IBk-s house asking people for money and it+IBk-s not
looked down on. You never feel like a failure in the hood, because someone+IBk-s
always worse off than you, and you don+IBk-t feel like you need to do more, because
the biggest success isn+IBk-t that much higher than you, either. It allows you to exist in
a state of suspended animation.
    The hood has a wonderful sense of community to it as well. Everyone knows
everyone, from the crackhead all the way through to the policeman. People take
care of one another. The way it works in the hood is that if any mom asks you to
do something, you have to say yes. +IBw-Can I send you?+IB0- is the phrase. It+IBk-s like
everyone+IBk-s your mom, and you+IBk-re everyone+IBk-s kid.
    +IBw-Can I send you?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, whaddya need?+IB0-
    +IBw-I need you to go buy milk and bread.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, cool.+IB0-
    Then she gives you some money and you go buy milk and bread. As long as
you aren+IBk-t busy and it doesn+IBk-t cost you anything, you don+IBk-t say no.
     The biggest thing in the hood is that you have to share. You can+IBk-t get rich on
your own. You have money? Why aren+IBk-t you helping people? The old lady on the
block needs help, everyone pitches in. You+IBk-re buying beer, you buy beer for
everyone. You spread it around. Everyone must know that your success benefits
the community in one way or another, or you become a target.
     The township polices itself as well. If someone+IBk-s caught stealing, the township
deals with them. If someone+IBk-s caught breaking into a house, the township deals
with them. If you+IBk-re caught raping a woman, pray to God the police find you
before the township does. If a woman is being hit, people don+IBk-t get involved. There
are too many questions with a beating. What+IBk-s the fight about? Who+IBk-s responsible?
Who started it? But rape is rape. Theft is theft. You+IBk-ve desecrated the community.
    The hood was strangely comforting, but comfort can be dangerous. Comfort
provides a floor but also a ceiling. In our crew, our friend G was like the rest of us,
unemployed, hanging out. Then he got a job at a nice clothing store. Every
morning he went to work, and the guys would tease him about going to work.
We+IBk-d see him headed out all dressed up, and everyone would be laughing at him.
+IBw-Oh, G, look at you in your fancy clothes+ACEgHQ- +IBw-Oh, G, going to go see the white man
today, huh?+IB0- +IBw-Oh, G, don+IBk-t forget to bring some books back from the library+ACEgHQ-
    One morning, after a month of G working at the place, we were hanging out
on the wall, and G came out in his slippers and his socks. He wasn+IBk-t dressed for
work.
    +IBw-Yo, G, what+IBk-s going on? What+IBk-s up with the job?+IB0-
    +IBw-Oh, I don+IBk-t work there anymore.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why?+IB0-
    +IBw-They accused me of stealing something and I got fired.+IB0-
    And I+IBk-ll never forget thinking to myself that it felt like he did it on purpose. He
sabotaged himself so that he+IBk-d get accepted back into the group again.
     The hood has a gravitational pull. It never leaves you behind, but it also never
lets you leave. Because by making the choice to leave, you+IBk-re insulting the place
that raised you and made you and never turned you away. And that place fights
you back.
     As soon as things start going well for you in the hood, it+IBk-s time to go. Because
the hood will drag you back in. It will find a way. There will be a guy who steals a
thing and puts it in your car and the cops find it+IBQ- something. You can+IBk-t stay. You
think you can. You+IBk-ll start doing better and you+IBk-ll bring your hood friends out to a
nice club, and the next thing you know somebody starts a fight and one of your
friends pulls a gun and somebody+IBk-s getting shot and you+IBk-re left standing around
going, +IBw-What just happened?+IB0-
    The hood happened.
                                          +IBQ-
One night I was DJ+IBk-ing a party, not in Alex but right outside Alex in Lombardy
East, a nicer, middle-class black neighborhood. The police were called about the
noise. They came busting in wearing riot gear and pointing machine guns. That+IBk-s
how our police roll. We don+IBk-t have small and then big. What Americans call SWAT
is just our regular police. They came looking for the source of the music, and the
music was coming from me. This one cop came over to where I was with my
computer and pulled this massive assault rifle on me.
    +IBw-You gotta shut this down right now.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay, okay,+IB0- I said. +IBw-I+IBk-m shutting it down.+IB0-
     But I was running Windows 95. Windows 95 took forever to shut down. I was
closing windows, shutting down programs. I had one of those fat Seagate drives
that damaged easily, and I didn+IBk-t want to cut the power and possibly damage the
drive. This cop clearly didn+IBk-t give a fuck about any of that.
    +IBw-Shut it down+ACE- Shut it down+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-I am+ACE- I+IBk-m shutting it down+ACE- I have to close the programs+ACEgHQ-
    The crowd was getting angry, and the cop was getting nervous. He turned his
gun away from me and shot the computer. Only he clearly didn+IBk-t know anything
about computers because he shot the monitor. The monitor exploded but the
music kept playing. Now there was chaos+IBQ-music blaring and everyone running
and panicking because of the gunshot. I yanked the power cord out of the tower to
shut the thing down. Then the cops started firing tear gas into the crowd.
     The tear gas had nothing to do with me or the music. Tear gas is just what the
police use to shut down parties in black neighborhoods, like the club turning on
the lights to tell everyone to go home.
      I lost the hard drive. Even though the cop shot the monitor the explosion
somehow fried the thing. The computer would still boot up, but it couldn+IBk-t read
the drive. My music library was gone. Even if I+IBk-d had the money for a new hard
drive, it had taken me years to amass the music collection. There was no way to
replace it. The DJ+IBk-ing business was over. The CD-selling business was done. All of
a sudden our crew lost its main revenue stream. All we had left was the hustle, and
we hustled even harder, taking the bit of cash we had on hand and trying to double
it, buying this to flip it for that. We started eating into our savings, and in less than
a month we were running on dust.
    Then, one evening after work, our friend from the airport, the black Mr.
Burns, came by.
    +IBw-Hey, look what I found,+IB0- he said.
    +IBw-What+IBk-ve you got?+IB0-
    +IBw-A camera.+IB0-
     I+IBk-ll never forget that camera. It was a digital camera. We bought it from him,
and I took it and turned it on. It was full of pictures of a nice white family on
vacation, and I felt like shit. The other things we+IBk-d bought had never mattered to
me. Nikes, electric toothbrushes, electric razors. Who cares? Yeah, some guy
might get fired because of the pallet of Corn Flakes that went missing from the
supermarket, but that+IBk-s degrees removed. You don+IBk-t think about it. But this
camera had a face. I went through those pictures, knowing how much my family
pictures meant to me, and I thought, I haven+IBk-t stolen a camera. I+IBk-ve stolen
someone+IBk-s memories. I+IBk-ve stolen part of someone+IBk-s life.
     It+IBk-s such a strange thing, but in two years of hustling I never once thought of it
as a crime. I honestly didn+IBk-t think it was bad. It+IBk-s just stuff people found. White
people have insurance. Whatever rationalization was handy. In society, we do
horrible things to one another because we don+IBk-t see the person it affects. We don+IBk-t
see their face. We don+IBk-t see them as people. Which was the whole reason the hood
was built in the first place, to keep the victims of apartheid out of sight and out of
mind. Because if white people ever saw black people as human, they would see
that slavery is unconscionable. We live in a world where we don+IBk-t see the
ramifications of what we do to others, because we don+IBk-t live with them. It would be
a whole lot harder for an investment banker to rip off people with subprime
mortgages if he actually had to live with the people he was ripping off. If we could
see one another+IBk-s pain and empathize with one another, it would never be worth it
to us to commit the crimes in the first place.
     As much as we needed the money, I never sold the camera. I felt too guilty,
like it would be bad karma, which I know sounds stupid and it didn+IBk-t get the
family their camera back, but I just couldn+IBk-t do it. That camera made me confront
the fact that there were people on the other end of this thing I was doing, and what
I was doing was wrong.
                                         +IBQ-
One night our crew got invited to dance in Soweto against another crew. Hitler
was going to compete with their best dancer, Hector, who was one of the best
dancers in South Africa at the time. This invitation was a huge deal. We were
going over there repping our hood. Alex and Soweto have always had a huge
rivalry. Soweto was seen as the snobbish township and Alexandra was seen as the
gritty and dirty township. Hector was from Diepkloof, which was the nice, well-off
part of Soweto. Diepkloof was where the first million-rand houses were built after
democracy. +IBw-Hey, we+IBk-re not a township anymore. We+IBk-re building nice things now.+IB0-
That was the attitude. That+IBk-s who we were up against. Hitler practiced a whole
week.
     We took a minibus over to Diepkloof the night of the dance, me and Bongani,
Mzi and Bheki and G, and Hitler. Hector won the competition. Then G was caught
kissing one of their girls, and it turned into a fight and everything broke down. On
our way back to Alex, around one in the morning, as we were pulling out of
Diepkloof to get on the freeway, some cops pulled our minibus over. They made
everyone get out and they searched it. We were standing outside, lined up
alongside the car, when one of the cops came back.
    +IBw-We+IBk-ve found a gun,+IB0- he said. +IBw-Whose gun is it?+IB0-
    We all shrugged.
    +IBw-We don+IBk-t know,+IB0- we said.
    +IBw-Nope, somebody knows. It+IBk-s somebody+IBk-s gun.+IB0-
    +IBw-Officer, we really don+IBk-t know,+IB0- Bongani said.
    He slapped Bongani hard across the face.
    +IBw-You+IBk-re bullshitting me+ACEgHQ-
    Then he went down the line, slapping each of us across the face, berating us
about the gun. We couldn+IBk-t do anything but stand there and take it.
    +IBw-You guys are trash,+IB0- the cop said. +IBw-Where are you from?+IB0-
    +IBw-Alex.+IB0-
    +IBw-Ohhhhh, okay, I see. Dogs from Alex. You come here and you rob people and
you rape women and you hijack cars. Bunch of fucking hoodlums.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, we+IBk-re dancers. We don+IBk-t know+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t care. You+IBk-re all going to jail until we figure out whose gun this is.+IB0-
    At a certain point we realized what was going on. This cop was shaking us
down for a bribe. +IBw-Spot fine+IB0- is the euphemism everyone uses. You go through this
elaborate dance with the cop where you say the thing without saying the thing.
    +IBw-Can+IBk-t we do something?+IB0- you ask the officer.
    +IBw-What do you want me to do?+IB0-
    +IBw-We+IBk-re really sorry, Officer. What can we do?+IB0-
    +IBw-You tell me.+IB0-
     Then you+IBk-re supposed to make up a story whereby you indicate to the cop how
much money you have on you. Which we couldn+IBk-t do because we didn+IBk-t have any
money. So he took us to jail. It was a public bus. It could have been anyone+IBk-s gun,
but the guys from Alex were the only ones who got arrested. Everyone else in the
car was free to go. The cops took us to the police station and threw us in a cell and
pulled us out one by one for questioning. When they pulled me aside I had to give
my home address: Highlands North. The cop gave me the most confused look.
      +IBw-You+IBk-re not from Alex,+IB0- he said. +IBw-What are you doing with these crooks?+IB0- I
didn+IBk-t know what to say. He glared at me hard. +IBw-Listen here, rich boy. You think
it+IBk-s fun running around with these guys? This isn+IBk-t play-play anymore. Just tell me
the truth about your friends and the gun, and I+IBk-ll let you go.+IB0-
     I told him no, and he threw me back in the cell. We spent the night, and the
next day I called a friend, who said he could borrow the money from his dad to get
us out. Later that day the dad came down and paid the money. The cops kept
calling it +IBw-bail,+IB0- but it was a bribe. We were never formally arrested or processed.
There was no paperwork.
     We got out and everything was fine, but it rattled us. Every day we were out in
the streets, hustling, trying to act as if we were in some way down with the gangs,
but the truth was we were always more cheese than hood. We had created this idea
of ourselves as a defense mechanism to survive in the world we were living in.
Bongani and the other East Bank guys, because of where they were from, what
they looked like+IBQ-they just had very little hope. You+IBk-ve got two options in that
situation. You take the retail job, flip burgers at McDonald+IBk-s, if you+IBk-re one of the
lucky few who even gets that much. The other option is to toughen up, put up this
facade. You can+IBk-t leave the hood, so you survive by the rules of the hood.
    I chose to live in that world, but I wasn+IBk-t from that world. If anything, I was
an imposter. Day to day I was in it as much as everyone else, but the difference
was that in the back of my mind I knew I had other options. I could leave. They
couldn+IBk-t.
O nce, when I was ten years old, visiting my dad in Yeoville, I needed batteries for one of my
toys. My mom had refused to buy me new batteries because, of course, she thought it was a
waste of money, so I snuck out to the shops and shoplifted a pack. A security guard busted me
on the way out, pulled me into his office, and called my mom.
   +IBw-We+IBk-ve caught your son shoplifting batteries,+IB0- he said. +IBw-You need to come and fetch him.+IB0-
   +IBw-No,+IB0- she said. +IBw-Take him to jail. If he+IBk-s going to disobey he needs to learn the
consequences.+IB0-
    Then she hung up. The guard looked at me, confused. Eventually he let me go on the
assumption that I was some wayward orphan, because what mother would send her ten-year-
old child to jail?
                       THE WORLD DOESN+IBk-T LOVE YOU



My mom never gave me an inch. Anytime I got in trouble it was tough love,
lectures, punishment, and hidings. Every time. For every infraction. You get that
with a lot of black parents. They+IBk-re trying to discipline you before the system does.
+IBw-I need to do this to you before the police do it to you.+IB0- Because that+IBk-s all black
parents are thinking from the day you+IBk-re old enough to walk out into the street,
where the law is waiting.
    In Alex, getting arrested was a fact of life. It was so common that out on the
corner we had a sign for it, a shorthand, clapping your wrists together like you
were being put in handcuffs. Everyone knew what that meant.
    +IBw-Where+IBk-s Bongani?+IB0-
    Wrist clap.
    +IBw-Oh, shit. When?+IB0-
    +IBw-Friday night.+IB0-
    +IBw-Damn.+IB0-
    My mom hated the hood. She didn+IBk-t like my friends there. If I brought them
back to the house, she didn+IBk-t even want them coming inside. +IBw-I don+IBk-t like those
boys,+IB0- she+IBk-d say. She didn+IBk-t hate them personally+ADs- she hated what they
represented. +IBw-You and those boys get into so much shit,+IB0- she+IBk-d say. +IBw-You must be
careful who you surround yourself with because where you are can determine who
you are.+IB0-
    She said the thing she hated most about the hood was that it didn+IBk-t pressure
me to become better. She wanted me to hang out with my cousin at his university.
     +IBw-What+IBk-s the difference if I+IBk-m at university or I+IBk-m in the hood?+IB0- I+IBk-d say. +IBw-It+IBk-s not
like I+IBk-m going to university.+IB0-
      +IBw-Yes, but the pressure of the university is going to get you. I know you. You
won+IBk-t sit by and watch these guys become better than you. If you+IBk-re in an
environment that is positive and progressive, you too will become that. I keep
telling you to change your life, and you don+IBk-t. One day you+IBk-re going to get arrested,
and when you do, don+IBk-t call me. I+IBk-ll tell the police to lock you up just to teach you a
lesson.+IB0-
     Because there were some black parents who+IBk-d actually do that, not pay their
kid+IBk-s bail, not hire their kid a lawyer+IBQ-the ultimate tough love. But it doesn+IBk-t
always work, because you+IBk-re giving the kid tough love when maybe he just needs
love. You+IBk-re trying to teach him a lesson, and now that lesson is the rest of his life.
                                          +IBQ-
One morning I saw an ad in the paper. Some shop was having a clearance sale on
mobile phones, and they were selling them at such a ridiculous price I knew
Bongani and I could flip them in the hood for a profit. This shop was out in the
suburbs, too far to walk and too out-of-the-way to take a minibus. Fortunately my
stepfather+IBk-s workshop and a bunch of old cars were in our backyard.
    I+IBk-d been stealing Abel+IBk-s junkers to get around since I was fourteen. I would
say I was test driving them to make sure they+IBk-d been repaired correctly. Abel
didn+IBk-t think that was funny. I+IBk-d been caught many times, caught and subjected to
my mother+IBk-s wrath. But that had never stopped me from doing anything.
     Most of these junkers weren+IBk-t street legal. They didn+IBk-t have proper
registrations or proper number plates. Luckily, Abel also had a stack of old
number plates in the back of the garage. I quickly learned I could just put one on
an old car and hit the road. I was nineteen, maybe twenty, not thinking about any
of the ramifications of this. I stopped by Abel+IBk-s garage when no one was around,
picked up one of the cars, the red Mazda I+IBk-d taken to the matric dance, slapped
some old plates on it, and set off in search of discounted cell phones.
     I got pulled over in Hillbrow. Cops in South Africa don+IBk-t give you a reason
when they pull you over. Cops pull you over because they+IBk-re cops and they have
the power to pull you over+ADs- it+IBk-s as simple as that. I used to watch American movies
where cops would pull people over and say, +IBw-You didn+IBk-t signal+IB0- or +IBw-Your taillight+IBk-s
out.+IB0- I+IBk-d always wonder, Why do American cops bother lying? One thing I
appreciate about South Africa is that we have not yet refined the system to the
point where we feel the need to lie.
    +IBw-Do you know why I pulled you over?+IB0-
    +IBw-Because you+IBk-re a policeman and I+IBk-m a black person?+IB0-
    +IBw-That+IBk-s correct. License and registration, please.+IB0-
     When the cop pulled me over, it was one of those situations where I wanted to
say, +IBw-Hey, I know you guys are racially profiling me+ACEgHQ- But I couldn+IBk-t argue the case
because I was, at that moment, actually breaking the law. The cop walked up to my
window, asked me the standard cop questions. Where are you going? Is this your
car? Whose car is this? I couldn+IBk-t answer. I completely froze.
     Being young, funnily enough, I was more worried about getting in trouble
with my parents than with the law. I+IBk-d had run-ins with the cops in Alexandra, in
Soweto, but it was always more about the circumstance: a party getting shut down,
a raid on a minibus. The law was all around me, but it had never come down on
me, Trevor, specifically. And when you haven+IBk-t had much experience with the law,
the law appears rational+IBQ-cops are dicks for the most part, but you also recognize
that they+IBk-re doing a job.
    Your parents, on the other hand, are not rational at all. They have served as
judge, jury, and executioner for your entire childhood, and it feels like they give
you a life sentence for every misdemeanor. In that moment, when I should have
been scared of the cop, all I was thinking was Shit shit shit+ADs- I+IBk-m in so much trouble
when I get home.
     The cop called in the number-plate registration and discovered that it didn+IBk-t
match the car. Now he was really on my case. +IBw-This car is not in your name+ACE-
What+IBk-s going on with these plates?+ACE- Step out of the vehicle+ACEgHQ- It was only then that I
realized: Ohhhhh, shit. Now I+IBk-m in real trouble. I stepped out of the car, and he
put the cuffs on me and told me I was being arrested on suspicion of driving a
stolen vehicle. He took me in, and the car was impounded.
     The Hillbrow police station looks exactly like every other police station in
South Africa. They were all built by the same contractor at the height of apartheid
+IBQ-separate nodes in the central nervous system of a police state. If you were
blindfolded and taken from one to the other, you probably wouldn+IBk-t even know
that you+IBk-d changed locations. They+IBk-re sterile, institutional, with fluorescent lights
and cheap floor tile, like a hospital. My cop walked me in and sat me down at the
front booking desk. I was charged and fingerprinted.
      In the meantime, they+IBk-d been checking out the car, which wasn+IBk-t going well
for me, either. Whenever I borrowed cars from Abel+IBk-s workshop, I tried to take the
junkers rather than a real client+IBk-s car+ADs- I thought I+IBk-d get in less trouble that way.
That was a mistake. The Mazda, being one of Abel+IBk-s junkers, didn+IBk-t have a clear
title of ownership. If it had had an owner, the cops would have called the owner,
the owner would have explained that the car had been dropped off for repairs, and
the whole thing would have been sorted out. Since the car didn+IBk-t have an owner, I
couldn+IBk-t prove I hadn+IBk-t stolen it.
    Carjackings were common in South Africa at the time, too. So common you
weren+IBk-t even surprised when they happened. You+IBk-d have a friend coming over for a
dinner party and you+IBk-d get a call.
    +IBw-Sorry. Got carjacked. Gonna be late.+IB0-
    +IBw-Ah, that sucks. Hey, guys+ACE- Dave got carjacked.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sorry, Dave+ACEgHQ-
     And the party would continue. And that+IBk-s if the person survived the
carjacking. Often they didn+IBk-t. People were getting shot for their cars all the time.
Not only could I not prove I hadn+IBk-t stolen the car, I couldn+IBk-t prove I hadn+IBk-t
murdered someone for it, either. The cops were grilling me. +IBw-You kill anyone to get
that car, boy? Eh? You a killer?+IB0-
     I was in deep, deep trouble. I had only one lifeline: my parents. One call
would have fixed everything. +IBw-This is my stepfather. He+IBk-s a mechanic. I borrowed
his car when I shouldn+IBk-t have.+IB0- Done. At worst I+IBk-d get a slap on the wrist for
driving a car that wasn+IBk-t registered. But what would I be getting at home?
      I sat there in the police station+IBQ-arrested for suspicion of grand theft auto, a
plausible suspect for carjacking or murder+IBQ-and debated whether I should call my
parents or go to jail. With my stepfather I was thinking, He might actually kill me.
In my mind that was an entirely realistic scenario. With my mother I was thinking,
She+IBk-s going to make this worse. She+IBk-s not the character witness I want right now.
She won+IBk-t help me. Because she+IBk-d told me she wouldn+IBk-t. +IBw-If you ever get arrested,
don+IBk-t call me.+IB0- I needed someone sympathetic to my plight, and I didn+IBk-t believe
she was that person. So I didn+IBk-t call my parents. I decided I didn+IBk-t need them. I
was a man. I could go it alone. I used my call to phone my cousin and told him not
to tell anyone what had happened while I figured out what to do+IBQ-now I just had
to figure out what to do.
     I+IBk-d been picked up late in the afternoon, so by the time I was processed it was
close to lights-out. I was spending the night in jail, like it or not. It was at that
point that a cop pulled me aside and told me what I was in for.
     The way the system works in South Africa is that you+IBk-re arrested and held in a
cell at the police station until your bail hearing. At the hearing, the judge looks at
your case, hears arguments from the opposing sides, and then he either dismisses
the charges or sets bail and a trial date. If you can make bail, you pay and go
home. But there are all sorts of ways your bail hearing can go wrong: You get some
court-appointed lawyer who hasn+IBk-t read your case and doesn+IBk-t know what+IBk-s going
on. Your family can+IBk-t pay your bail. It could even be that the court+IBk-s backed up.
+IBw-Sorry, we+IBk-re too busy. No more hearings today.+IB0- It doesn+IBk-t matter the reason.
Once you leave jail, you can+IBk-t go back to jail. If your situation isn+IBk-t resolved that
day, you go to prison to await trial. In prison you+IBk-re housed with the people
awaiting trial, not with the general population, but even the awaiting-trial section
is incredibly dangerous because you have people picked up for traffic violations all
the way up to proper hardened criminals. You+IBk-re stuck there together, and you can
be there for days, weeks, maybe months. It+IBk-s the same way in America. If you+IBk-re
poor, if you don+IBk-t know how the system works, you can slip through the cracks,
and the next thing you know you+IBk-re in this weird purgatory where you+IBk-re not in
prison but you+IBk-re not not in prison. You haven+IBk-t been convicted of any crime, but
you+IBk-re still locked up and can+IBk-t get out.
     This cop pulled me aside and said, +IBw-Listen, you don+IBk-t want to go to your bail
hearing. They+IBk-ll give you a state attorney who won+IBk-t know what+IBk-s going on. He+IBk-ll
have no time for you. He+IBk-ll ask the judge for a postponement, and then maybe
you+IBk-ll go free or maybe you won+IBk-t. Trust me, you don+IBk-t want to do that. You have
the right to stay here for as long as you like. You want to meet with a lawyer and
set yourself up before you go anywhere near a court or a judge.+IB0- He wasn+IBk-t giving
me this advice out of the goodness of his heart. He had a deal with a defense
attorney, sending him clients in exchange for a kickback. He handed me the
attorney+IBk-s business card, I called him, and he agreed to take my case. He told me
to stay put while he handled everything.
     Now I needed money, because lawyers, as nice as they are, don+IBk-t do anything
for free. I called a friend and asked him if he could ask his dad to borrow some
money. He said he+IBk-d handle it. He talked to his dad, and the lawyer got his retainer
the next day.
     With the lawyer taken care of, I felt like I had things under control. I was
feeling pretty slick. I+IBk-d handled the situation, and, most important, Mom and Abel
were none the wiser.
    When the time came for lights-out a cop came and took my stuff. My belt, my
wallet, my shoelaces.
    +IBw-Why do you need my shoelaces?+IB0-
    +IBw-So you don+IBk-t hang yourself.+IB0-
    +IBw-Right.+IB0-
     Even when he said that, the gravity of my situation still wasn+IBk-t sinking in.
Walking to the station+IBk-s holding cell, looking around at the other six guys in there,
I was thinking, This is no big deal. Everything+IBk-s gonna be cool. I+IBk-m gonna get out
of this. I thought that right up until the moment the cell door clanged shut behind
me and the guard yelled, +IBw-Lights out+ACEgHQ- That+IBk-s when I thought, Oh, shit. This is real.
                                          +IBQ-
The guards had given me a mat and a scratchy blanket. I rolled them out on the
concrete floor and tried to get comfortable. Every bad prison movie I+IBk-d ever seen
was racing through my head. I was thinking, I+IBk-m gonna get raped. I+IBk-m gonna get
raped. I+IBk-m gonna get raped. But of course I didn+IBk-t get raped, because this wasn+IBk-t
prison. It was jail, and there+IBk-s a big difference, as I would soon come to
understand.
    I woke up the next morning with that fleeting sensation where you think
something has all been a dream. Then I looked around and remembered that it
wasn+IBk-t. Breakfast came, and I settled in to wait.
     A day in jail is mostly silence punctuated by passing guards shouting
profanities at you, doing roll call. Inside the holding cell nobody says anything.
Nobody walks into a jail cell and says, +IBw-Hi, guys+ACE- I+IBk-m Brian+ACEgHQ- Because everyone is
afraid, and no one wants to appear vulnerable. Nobody wants to be the bitch.
Nobody wants to be the guy getting killed. I didn+IBk-t want anyone to know that I was
just a kid in for a traffic charge, so I reached back in my mind for all the
stereotypes of what I imagined people act like in prison, and then I tried to act like
that.
     In South Africa, everyone knows that colored gangsters are the most ruthless,
the most savage. It+IBk-s a stereotype that+IBk-s fed to you your whole life. The most
notorious colored gangs are the Numbers Gangs: the 26s, the 27s, the 28s. They
control the prisons. They+IBk-re known for being brutally violent+IBQ-maiming, torturing,
raping, cutting off people+IBk-s heads+IBQ-not for the sake of making money but just to
prove how ruthless and savage they are, like Mexican drug cartels. In fact a lot of
these gangs base their thing on those Mexican gangs. They have the same look: the
Converse All Stars with the Dickies pants and the open shirt buttoned only at the
top.
     By the time I was a teenager, anytime I was profiled by cops or security
guards, it usually wasn+IBk-t because I was black but because I looked colored. I went
to a club once with my cousin and his friend. The bouncer searched Mlungisi,
waved him in. He searched our friend, waved him in. Then he searched me and
got up in my face.
    +IBw-Where+IBk-s your knife?+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t have a knife.+IB0-
    +IBw-I know you have a knife somewhere. Where is it?+IB0-
     He searched and searched and finally gave up and let me in, looking me over
like I was trouble.
    +IBw-No shit from you+ACE- Okay?+IB0-
      I figured that if I was in jail people were going to assume I was the kind of
colored person who ends up in jail, a violent criminal. So I played it up. I put on
this character+ADs- I played the stereotype. Anytime the cops asked me questions I
started speaking in broken Afrikaans with a thick colored accent. Imagine a white
guy in America, just dark enough to pass for Latino, walking around jail doing bad
Mexican-gangster dialogue from the movies. +IBw-Shit+IBk-s about to get loco, ese.+IB0- That+IBk-s
basically what I was doing+IBQ-the South African version of that. This was my
brilliant plan to survive incarceration. But it worked. The guys in the cell with me,
they were there for drunk driving, for domestic abuse, for petty theft. They had no
idea what real colored gangsters were like. Everyone left me alone.
    We were all playing a game, only nobody knew we were playing it. When I
walked in that first night, everyone was giving me this look: +IBw-I+IBk-m dangerous. Don+IBk-t
fuck with me.+IB0- So I went, +IBw-Shit, these people are hardened criminals. I shouldn+IBk-t
be here, because I am not a criminal.+IB0- Then the next day everything turned over
quickly. One by one, guys left to go to their hearings, I stayed to wait for my
lawyer, and new people started to pitch up. Now I was the veteran, doing my
colored-gangster routine, giving the new guys the same look: +IBw-I+IBk-m dangerous.
Don+IBk-t fuck with me.+IB0- And they looked at me and went, +IBw-Shit, he+IBk-s a hardened
criminal. I shouldn+IBk-t be here, because I am not like him.+IB0- And round and round we
went.
     At a certain point it occurred to me that every single person in that cell might
be faking it. We were all decent guys from nice neighborhoods and good families,
picked up for unpaid parking tickets and other infractions. We could have been
having a great time sharing meals, playing cards, and talking about women and
soccer. But that didn+IBk-t happen, because everyone had adopted this dangerous pose
and nobody talked because everyone was afraid of who the other guys were
pretending to be. Now those guys were going to get out and go home to their
families and say, +IBw-Oh, honey, that was rough. Those were some real criminals in
there. There was this one colored guy. Man, he was a killer.+IB0-
     Once I had the game sorted out, I was good again. I relaxed. I was back to
thinking, I got this. This is no big deal. The food was actually decent. For breakfast
they brought you these peanut butter sandwiches on thick slices of bread. Lunch
was chicken and rice. The tea was too hot, and it was more water than tea, but it
was drinkable. There were older, hard-time prisoners close to parole, and their
detail was to come and clean the cells and circulate books and magazines for you
to read. It was quite relaxing.
     There was one point when I remember eating a meal and saying to myself,
This isn+IBk-t so bad. I hang around with a bunch of dudes. There+IBk-s no chores. No bills
to pay. No one constantly nagging me and telling me what to do. Peanut butter
sandwiches? Shit, I eat peanut butter sandwiches all the time. This is pretty
sweet. I could do this. I was so afraid of the ass-whooping waiting for me at home
that I genuinely considered going to prison. For a brief moment I thought I had a
plan. +IBw-I+IBk-ll go away for a couple of years, come back, and say I was kidnapped, and
mom will never know and she+IBk-ll just be happy to see me.+IB0-
                                         +IBQ-
On the third day, the cops brought in the largest man I+IBk-d ever seen. This guy was
huge. Giant muscles. Dark skin. Hardened face. He looked like he could kill all of
us. Me and the other prisoners who+IBk-d been acting tough with one another+IBQ-the
second he walked in our tough-guy routines were over. Everyone was terrified. We
all stared at him. +IBw-Oh, fuck+ICYgHQ-
    For whatever reason this guy was half naked when the cops picked him up.
He was wearing clothes the police had scrounged up for him at the station, this
torn-up wifebeater that was way too small, pants so short on him they looked like
capris. He looked like a black version of the Incredible Hulk.
     This guy went and sat alone in the corner. Nobody said a word. Everyone
watched and waited, nervously, to see what he would do. Then one of the cops
came back and called the Hulk over+ADs- they needed information from him. The cop
started asking him a bunch of questions, but the guy kept shaking his head and
saying he didn+IBk-t understand. The cop was speaking Zulu. The Hulk was speaking
Tsonga. Black person to black person, and neither could understand the other+IBQ-
the Tower of Babel. Few people in South Africa speak Tsonga, but since my
stepfather was Tsonga I had picked it up along the way. I overheard the cop and
the other guy going back and forth with nothing getting across, so I stepped in and
translated for them and sorted everything out.
     Nelson Mandela once said, +IBw-If you talk to a man in a language he
understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to
his heart.+IB0- He was so right. When you make the effort to speak someone else+IBk-s
language, even if it+IBk-s just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, +IBw-I
understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as
a human being.+IB0-
    That is exactly what happened with the Hulk. The second I spoke to him, this
face that had seemed so threatening and mean lit up with gratitude. +IBw-Ah, na
khensa, na khensa, na khensa. Hi wena mani? Mufana wa mukhaladi u xitiela
kwini xiTsonga? U huma kwini?+IB0- +IBw-Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Who are
you? How does a colored guy know Tsonga? Where are you from?+IB0-
     Once we started talking I realized he wasn+IBk-t the Hulk at all. He was the
sweetest man, a gentle giant, the biggest teddy bear in the world. He was simple,
not educated. I+IBk-d assumed he was in for murder, for squashing a family to death
with his bare hands, but it wasn+IBk-t anything like that. He+IBk-d been arrested for
shoplifting PlayStation games. He was out of work and needed money to send to
his family back home, and when he saw how much these games sold for he
thought he could steal a few and sell them to white kids and make a lot of money.
As soon as he told me that, I knew he wasn+IBk-t some hardened criminal. I know the
world of pirated things+IBQ-stolen videogames have no value because it+IBk-s cheaper and
less risky to copy them, like Bolo+IBk-s parents did.
     I tried to help him out a bit. I told him my trick of putting off your bail
hearing to get your defense together, so he stayed in the cell, too, biding his time,
and we hit it off and hung out for a few days, having a good time, getting to know
each other. No one else in the cell knew what to make of us, the ruthless colored
gangster and his menacing, Hulk-like friend. He told me his story, a South African
story that was all too familiar to me: The man grows up under apartheid, working
on a farm, part of what+IBk-s essentially a slave labor force. It+IBk-s a living hell but it+IBk-s at
least something. He+IBk-s paid a pittance but at least he+IBk-s paid. He+IBk-s told where to be
and what to do every waking minute of his day. Then apartheid ends and he
doesn+IBk-t even have that anymore. He finds his way to Johannesburg, looking for
work, trying to feed his children back home. But he+IBk-s lost. He has no education. He
has no skills. He doesn+IBk-t know what to do, doesn+IBk-t know where to be. The world
has been taught to be scared of him, but the reality is that he is scared of the world
because he has none of the tools necessary to cope with it. So what does he do? He
takes shit. He becomes a petty thief. He+IBk-s in and out of jail. He gets lucky and finds
some construction work, but then he gets laid off from that, and a few days later
he+IBk-s in a shop and he sees some PlayStation games and he grabs them, but he
doesn+IBk-t even know enough to know that he+IBk-s stolen something of no value.
    I felt terrible for him. The more time I spent in jail, the more I realized that
the law isn+IBk-t rational at all. It+IBk-s a lottery. What color is your skin? How much
money do you have? Who+IBk-s your lawyer? Who+IBk-s the judge? Shoplifting PlayStation
games was less of an offense than driving with bad number plates. He had
committed a crime, but he was no more a criminal than I was. The difference was
that he didn+IBk-t have any friends or family to help him out. He couldn+IBk-t afford
anything but a state attorney. He was going to go stand in the dock, unable to
speak or understand English, and everyone in the courtroom was going to assume
the worst of him. He was going to go to prison for a while and then be set free with
the same nothing he had going in. If I had to guess, he was around thirty-five,
forty years old, staring down another thirty-five, forty years of the same.
                                         +IBQ-
The day of my hearing came. I said goodbye to my new friend and wished him the
best. Then I was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van and driven to the
courthouse to meet my fate. In South African courts, to minimize your exposure
and your opportunities for escape, the holding cell where you await your hearing
is a massive pen below the courtroom+ADs- you walk up a set of stairs into the dock
rather than being escorted through the corridors. What happens in the holding
cell is you+IBk-re mixed in with the people who+IBk-ve been in prison awaiting trial for
weeks and months. It+IBk-s a weird mix, everything from white-collar criminals to
guys picked up on traffic stops to real, hardcore criminals covered with prison
tattoos. It+IBk-s like the cantina scene from Star Wars, where the band+IBk-s playing music
and Han Solo+IBk-s in the corner and all of the bad guys and bounty hunters from all
over the universe are hanging out+IBQ-a wretched hive of scum and villainy, only
there+IBk-s no music and there+IBk-s no Han Solo.
    I was with these people for only a brief window of time, but in that moment I
saw the difference between prison and jail. I saw the difference between criminals
and people who+IBk-ve committed crimes. I saw the hardness in people+IBk-s faces. I
thought back on how naive I+IBk-d been just hours before, thinking jail wasn+IBk-t so bad
and I could handle it. I was now truly afraid of what might happen to me.
     When I walked into that holding pen, I was a smooth-skinned, fresh-faced
young man. At the time, I had a giant Afro, and the only way to control it was to
have it tied back in this ponytail thing that looked really girly. I looked like
Maxwell. The guards closed the door behind me, and this creepy old dude yelled
out in Zulu from the back, +IBw-Ha, ha, ha+ACE- Hhe madoda+ACE- Angikaze ngibone indoda
enhle kangaka+ACE- Sizoba nobusuku obuhle+ACEgHQ- +IBw-Yo, yo, yo+ACE- Damn, guys. I+IBk-ve never
seen a man this beautiful before. It+IBk-s gonna be a good night tonight+ACEgHQ-
    Fuuuuuuuuuck.
     Right next to me as I walked in was a young man having a complete
meltdown, talking to himself, bawling his eyes out. He looked up and locked eyes
with me, and I guess he thought I looked like a kindred soul he could talk to. He
came straight at me and started crying about how he+IBk-d been arrested and thrown
in jail and the gangs had stolen his clothes and his shoes and raped him and beat
him every day. He wasn+IBk-t some ruffian. He was well-spoken, educated. He+IBk-d been
waiting for a year for his case to be heard+ADs- he wanted to kill himself. That guy put
the fear of God in me.
     I looked around the holding cell. There were easily a hundred guys in there,
all of them spread out and huddled into their clearly and unmistakably defined
racial groups: a whole bunch of black people in one corner, the colored people in a
different corner, a couple of Indians off to themselves, and a handful of white guys
off to one side. The guys who+IBk-d been with me in the police van, the second we
walked in, they instinctively, automatically, walked off to join the groups they
belonged to. I froze.
    I didn+IBk-t know where to go.
     I looked over at the colored corner. I was staring at the most notorious, most
violent prison gang in South Africa. I looked like them, but I wasn+IBk-t them. I
couldn+IBk-t go over there doing my fake gangster shit and have them discover I was a
fraud. No, no, no. That game was over, my friend. The last thing I needed was
colored gangsters up against me.
    But then what if I went to the black corner? I know that I+IBk-m black and I
identify as black, but I+IBk-m not a black person on the face of it, so would the black
guys understand why I was walking over? And what kind of shit would I start by
going there? Because going to the black corner as a perceived colored person
might piss off the colored gangs even more than going to the colored corner as a
fake colored person. Because that+IBk-s what had happened to me my entire life.
Colored people would see me hanging out with blacks, and they+IBk-d confront me,
want to fight me. I saw myself starting a race war in the holding cell.
    +IBw-Hey+ACE- Why are you hanging out with the blacks?+IB0-
    +IBw-Because I am black.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, you+IBk-re not. You+IBk-re colored.+IB0-
     +IBw-Ah, yes. I know it looks that way, friend, but let me explain. It+IBk-s a funny
story, actually. My father is white and my mother is black and race is a social
construct, so+ICYgHQ-
    That wasn+IBk-t going to work. Not here.
     All of this was happening in my head in an instant, on the fly. I was doing
crazy calculations, looking at people, scanning the room, assessing the variables. If
I go here, then this. If I go there, then that. My whole life was flashing before me+IBQ-
the playground at school, the spaza shops in Soweto, the streets of Eden Park+IBQ-
every time and every place I ever had to be a chameleon, navigate between groups,
explain who I was. It was like the high school cafeteria, only it was the high school
cafeteria from hell because if I picked the wrong table I might get beaten or
stabbed or raped. I+IBk-d never been more scared in my life. But I still had to pick.
Because racism exists, and you have to pick a side. You can say that you don+IBk-t pick
sides, but eventually life will force you to pick a side.
     That day I picked white. They just didn+IBk-t look like they could hurt me. It was a
handful of average, middle-aged white dudes. I walked over to them. We hung out
for a while, chatted a bit. They were mostly in for white-collar crimes, money
schemes, fraud and racketeering. They+IBk-d be useless if anyone came over looking to
start trouble+ADs- they+IBk-d get their asses kicked as well. But they weren+IBk-t going to do
anything to me. I was safe.
    Luckily the time went by fairly quickly. I was in there for only an hour before I
was called up to court, where a judge would either let me go or send me to prison
to await trial. As I was leaving, one of the white guys reached over to me. +IBw-Make
sure you don+IBk-t come back down here,+IB0- he said. +IBw-Cry in front of the judge+ADs- do
whatever you have to do. If you go up and get sent back down here, your life will
never be the same.+IB0-
    Up in the courtroom, I found my lawyer waiting. My cousin Mlungisi was
there, too, in the gallery, ready to post my bail if things went my way.
    The bailiff read out my case number, and the judge looked up at me.
    +IBw-How are you?+IB0- he said.
    I broke down. I+IBk-d been putting on this tough-guy facade for nearly a week,
and I just couldn+IBk-t do it anymore.
    +IBw-I-I+IBk-m not fine, Your Honor. I+IBk-m not fine.+IB0-
    He looked confused. +IBw-What?+ACEgHQ-
    I said, +IBw-I+IBk-m not fine, sir. I+IBk-m really suffering.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why are you telling me this?+IB0-
    +IBw-Because you asked how I was.+IB0-
    +IBw-Who asked you?+IB0-
    +IBw-You did. You just asked me.+IB0-
    +IBw-I didn+IBk-t say, +IBg-How are you?+IBk- I said, +IBg-Who are you?+IBk- Why would I waste time
asking +IBg-How are you?+IBkAIQ- This is jail. I know everyone is suffering down there. If I
asked everyone +IBg-How are you?+IBk- we+IBk-d be here all day. I said, +IBg-Who are you?+IBk- State
your name for the record.+IB0-
    +IBw-Trevor Noah.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay. Now we can carry on.+IB0-
     The whole courtroom started laughing, so then I started laughing, too. But
now I was even more petrified because I didn+IBk-t want the judge to think I wasn+IBk-t
taking him seriously because I was laughing.
    It turned out that I needn+IBk-t have been worried. Everything that happened next
took only a few minutes. My lawyer had talked to the prosecutor and everything
had been arranged beforehand. He presented my case. I had no priors. I wasn+IBk-t
dangerous. There were no objections from the opposing side. The judge assigned
my trial date and set my bail, and I was free to go.
     I walked out of court and the light of day hit my face and I said, +IBw-Sweet Jesus,
I am never going back there again.+IB0- It had been only a week, in a cell that wasn+IBk-t
terribly uncomfortable with food that wasn+IBk-t half bad, but a week in jail is a long,
long time. A week without shoelaces is a long, long time. A week with no clocks,
with no sun, can feel like an eternity. The thought of anything worse, the thought
of doing real time in a real prison, I couldn+IBk-t even imagine.
                                         +IBQ-
I drove with Mlungisi to his place, took a shower, and slept there. The next day he
dropped me back at my mom+IBk-s house. I strolled up the driveway acting real casual.
My plan was to say I+IBk-d been crashing with Mlungisi for a few days. I walked into
the house like nothing had happened. +IBw-Hey, Mom+ACE- What+IBk-s up?+IB0- Mom didn+IBk-t say
anything, didn+IBk-t ask me any questions. I was like, Okay. Cool. We+IBk-re good.
     I stayed for most of the day. Later in the afternoon we were sitting at the
kitchen table, talking. I was telling all these stories, going on about everything
Mlungisi and I had been up to that week, and I caught my mom giving me this
look, slowly shaking her head. It was a different look than I had ever seen her give
before. It wasn+IBk-t +IBw-One day, I+IBk-m going to catch you.+IB0- It wasn+IBk-t anger or disapproval.
It was disappointment. She was hurt.
    +IBw-What?+IB0- I said. +IBw-What is it?+IB0-
    She said, +IBw-Boy, who do you think paid your bail? Hmm? Who do you think
paid your lawyer? Do you think I+IBk-m an idiot? Did you think no one would tell me?+IB0-
     The truth came spilling out. Of course she+IBk-d known: the car. It had been
missing the whole time. I+IBk-d been so wrapped up in dealing with jail and covering
my tracks I+IBk-d forgotten that the proof of my crime was right there in the yard, the
red Mazda missing from the driveway. And of course when I called my friend and
he+IBk-d asked his dad for the money for the lawyer, the dad had pressed him on what
the money was for and, being a parent himself, had called my mother
immediately. She+IBk-d given my friend the money to pay the lawyer. She+IBk-d given my
cousin the money to pay my bail. I+IBk-d spent the whole week in jail thinking I was so
slick. But she+IBk-d known everything the whole time.
     +IBw-I know you see me as some crazy old bitch nagging at you,+IB0- she said, +IBw-but you
forget the reason I ride you so hard and give you so much shit is because I love
you. Everything I have ever done I+IBk-ve done from a place of love. If I don+IBk-t punish
you, the world will punish you even worse. The world doesn+IBk-t love you. If the
police get you, the police don+IBk-t love you. When I beat you, I+IBk-m trying to save you.
When they beat you, they+IBk-re trying to kill you.+IB0-
M y favorite thing to eat as a kid, and still my favorite dessert of all time, was custard and
jelly, what Americans would call Jell-O. One Saturday my mom was planning for a big family
celebration and she made a huge bowl of custard and jelly and put it in the fridge. It had every
flavor: red, green, and yellow. I couldn+IBk-t resist it. That whole day, every time I walked past the
fridge I+IBk-d pop my head in with a spoon and sneak a bite. This was a giant bowl, meant to last
for a week for the whole family. I finished it in one day by myself.
    That night I went to bed and I got absolutely butchered by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes love to
feast on me, and when I was a kid it was bad. They would destroy me at night. I would wake up
covered with bites and feel ill to my stomach and itchy all over. Which was exactly what
happened this particular Sunday morning. Covered with mosquito bites, my stomach bloated
with custard and jelly, I could barely get out of bed. I felt like I was going to vomit. Then my
mom walked in.
    +IBw-Get dressed,+IB0- she said. +IBw-We+IBk-re going to church.+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t feel well.+IB0-
    +IBw-That+IBk-s why we+IBk-re going to church. That+IBk-s where Jesus is going to heal you.+IB0-
    +IBw-Eh, I+IBk-m not sure that+IBk-s how it works.+IB0-
   My mom and I had different ideas about how Jesus worked. She believed that you pray to
Jesus and then Jesus pitches up and does the thing that you need. My views on Jesus were
more reality-based.
   +IBw-Why don+IBk-t I take medicine,+IB0- I said, +IBw-and then pray to Jesus to thank him for giving us the
doctors who invented medicine, because medicine is what makes you feel better, not Jesus.+IB0-
    +IBw-You don+IBk-t need medicine if you have Jesus. Jesus will heal you. Pray to Jesus.+IB0-
    +IBw-But is medicine not a blessing from Jesus? And if Jesus gives us medicine and we do not
take the medicine, are we not denying the grace that he has given us?+IB0-
    Like all of our debates about Jesus, this conversation went nowhere.
    +IBw-Trevor,+IB0- she said, +IBw-if you don+IBk-t go to church you+IBk-re going to get worse. You+IBk-re lucky you
got sick on Sunday, because now we+IBk-re going to church and you can pray to Jesus and Jesus is
going to heal you.+IB0-
    +IBw-That sounds nice, but why don+IBk-t I just stay home?+IB0-
    +IBw-No. Get dressed. We+IBk-re going to church.+IB0-
                                                  MY MOTHER+IBk-S LIFE



Once I had my hair cornrowed for the matric dance, I started getting attention
from girls for the first time. I actually went on dates. At times I thought that it was
because I looked better. At other times I thought it was because girls liked the fact
that I was going through as much pain as they did to look good. Either way, once I
found success, I wasn+IBk-t going to mess with the formula. I kept going back to the
salon every week, spending hours at a time getting my hair straightened and
cornrowed. My mom would just roll her eyes. +IBw-I could never date a man who
spends more time on his hair than I do,+IB0- she+IBk-d say.
      Monday through Saturday my mom worked in her office and puttered around
her garden dressed like a homeless person. Then Sunday morning for church she+IBk-d
do her hair and put on a nice dress and some high heels and she looked like a
million bucks. Once she was all done up, she couldn+IBk-t resist teasing me, throwing
little verbal jabs the way we+IBk-d always do with each other.
    +IBw-Now who+IBk-s the best-looking person in the family, eh? I hope you enjoyed
your week of being the pretty one, +IBk-cause the queen is back, baby. You spent four
hours at the salon to look like that. I just took a shower.+IB0-
     She was just having fun with me+ADs- no son wants to talk about how hot his mom
is. Because, truth be told, she was beautiful. Beautiful on the outside, beautiful on
the inside. She had a self-confidence about her that I never possessed. Even when
she was working in the garden, dressed in overalls and covered in mud, you could
see how attractive she was.
                                          +IBQ-
I can only assume that my mother broke more than a few hearts in her day, but
from the time I was born, there were only two men in her life, my father and my
stepfather. Right around the corner from my father+IBk-s house in Yeoville, there was a
garage called Mighty Mechanics. Our Volkswagen was always breaking down, and
my mom would take it there to get it repaired. We met this really cool guy there,
Abel, one of the auto mechanics. I+IBk-d see him when we went to fetch the car. The
car broke down a lot, so we were there a lot. Eventually it felt like we were there
even when there was nothing wrong with the vehicle. I was six, maybe seven. I
didn+IBk-t understand everything that was happening. I just knew that suddenly this
guy was around. He was tall, lanky and lean but strong. He had these long arms
and big hands. He could lift car engines and gearboxes. He was handsome, but he
wasn+IBk-t good-looking. My mom liked that about him+ADs- she used to say there+IBk-s a type
of ugly that women find attractive. She called him Abie. He called her Mbuyi,
short for Nombuyiselo.
     I liked him, too. Abie was charming and hilarious and had an easy, gracious
smile. He loved helping people, too, especially anyone in distress. If someone+IBk-s car
broke down on the freeway, he pulled over to see what he could do. If someone
yelled +IBw-Stop, thief+ACEgHQ- he was the guy who gave chase. The old lady next door needed
help moving boxes? He+IBk-s that guy. He liked to be liked by the world, which made
his abuse even harder to deal with. Because if you think someone is a monster and
the whole world says he+IBk-s a saint, you begin to think that you+IBk-re the bad person. It
must be my fault this is happening is the only conclusion you can draw, because
why are you the only one receiving his wrath?
      Abel was always cool with me. He wasn+IBk-t trying to be my dad, and my dad was
still in my life, so I wasn+IBk-t looking for anyone to replace him. That+IBk-s mom+IBk-s cool
friend is how I thought of him. He started coming out to stay with us in Eden
Park. Some nights he+IBk-d want us to crash with him at his converted garage flat in
Orange Grove, which we did. Then I burned down the white people+IBk-s house, and
that was the end of that. From then on we lived together in Eden Park.
    One night my mom and I were at a prayer meeting and she took me aside.
    +IBw-Hey,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I want to tell you something. Abel and I are going to get
married.+IB0-
    Instinctively, without even thinking, I said, +IBw-I don+IBk-t think that+IBk-s a good idea.+IB0-
      I wasn+IBk-t upset or anything. I just had a sense about the guy, an intuition. I+IBk-d
felt it even before the mulberry tree. That night hadn+IBk-t changed my feelings toward
Abel+ADs- it had only shown me, in flesh and blood, what he was capable of.
    +IBw-I understand that it+IBk-s hard,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I understand that you don+IBk-t want a
new dad.+IB0-
    +IBw-No,+IB0- I said. +IBw-It+IBk-s not that. I like Abel. I like him a lot. But you shouldn+IBk-t marry
him.+IB0- I didn+IBk-t know the word +IBw-sinister+IB0- then, but if I had I probably would have
used it. +IBw-There+IBk-s just something not right about him. I don+IBk-t trust him. I don+IBk-t
think he+IBk-s a good person.+IB0-
    I+IBk-d always been fine with my mom dating this guy, but I+IBk-d never considered
the possibility of him becoming a permanent addition to our family. I enjoyed
being with Abel the same way I enjoyed playing with a tiger cub the first time I
went to a tiger sanctuary: I liked it, I had fun with it, but I never thought about
bringing it home.
    If there was any doubt about Abel, the truth was right there in front of us all
along, in his name. He was Abel, the good brother, the good son, a name straight
out of the Bible. And he lived up to it as well. He was the firstborn, dutiful, took
care of his mother, took care of his siblings. He was the pride of his family.
    But Abel was his English name. His Tsonga name was Ngisaveni. It means
+IBw-Be afraid.+IB0-
                                          +IBQ-
Mom and Abel got married. There was no ceremony, no exchange of rings. They
went and signed the papers and that was it. A year or so later, my baby brother,
Andrew, was born. I only vaguely remember my mom being gone for a few days,
and when she got back there was now this thing in the house that cried and shat
and got fed, but when you+IBk-re nine years older than your sibling, their arrival
doesn+IBk-t change much for you. I wasn+IBk-t changing diapers+ADs- I was out playing arcade
games at the shop, running around the neighborhood.
     The main thing that marked Andrew+IBk-s birth for me was our first trip to meet
Abel+IBk-s family during the Christmas holidays. They lived in Tzaneen, a town in
Gazankulu, what had been the Tsonga homeland under apartheid. Tzaneen has a
tropical climate, hot and humid. The white farms nearby grow some of the most
amazing fruit+IBQ-mangoes, lychees, the most beautiful bananas you+IBk-ve ever seen in
your life. That+IBk-s where all the fruit we export to Europe comes from. But on the
black land twenty minutes down the road, the soil has been decimated by years of
overfarming and overgrazing. Abel+IBk-s mother and his sisters were all traditional,
stay-at-home moms, and Abel and his younger brother, who was a policeman,
supported the family. They were all very kind and generous and accepted us as
part of the family right away.
     Tsonga culture, I learned, is extremely patriarchal. We+IBk-re talking about a
world where women must bow when they greet a man. Men and women have
limited social interactions. The men kill the animals, and the women cook the
food. Men are not even allowed in the kitchen. As a nine-year-old boy, I thought
this was fantastic. I wasn+IBk-t allowed to do anything. At home my mom was forever
making me do chores+IBQ-wash the dishes, sweep the house+IBQ-but when she tried to
do that in Tzaneen, the women wouldn+IBk-t allow it.
    +IBw-Trevor, make your bed,+IB0- my mom would say.
     +IBw-No, no, no, no,+IB0- Abel+IBk-s mother would protest. +IBw-Trevor must go outside and
play.+IB0-
    I was made to run off and have fun while my girl step-cousins had to clean the
house and help the women cook. I was in heaven.
    My mother loathed every moment of being there. For Abel, a firstborn son
who was bringing home his own firstborn son, this trip was a huge deal. In the
homelands, the firstborn son almost becomes the father/husband by default
because the dad is off working in the city. The firstborn son is the man of the
house. He raises his siblings. His mom treats him with a certain level of respect as
the dad+IBk-s surrogate. Since this was Abel+IBk-s big homecoming with Andrew, he
expected my mother to play her traditional role, too. But she refused.
     The women in Tzaneen had a multitude of jobs during the day. They prepared
breakfast, prepared tea, prepared lunch, did the washing and the cleaning. The
men had been working all year in the city to support the family, so this was their
vacation, more or less. They were at leisure, waited on by the women. They might
slaughter a goat or something, do whatever manly tasks needed to be done, but
then they would go to an area that was only for men and hang out and drink while
the women cooked and cleaned. But my mom had been working in the city all
year, too, and Patricia Noah didn+IBk-t stay in anyone+IBk-s kitchen. She was a free-
roaming spirit. She insisted on walking to the village, going where the men hung
out, talking to the men as equals.
     The whole tradition of women bowing to the men, my mom found that
absurd. But she didn+IBk-t refuse to do it. She overdid it. She made a mockery of it.
The other women would bow before men with this polite little curtsy. My mom
would go down and cower, groveling in the dirt like she was worshipping a deity,
and she+IBk-d stay down there for a long time, like a really long time, long enough to
make everyone very uncomfortable. That was my mom. Don+IBk-t fight the system.
Mock the system. To Abel, it looked like his wife didn+IBk-t respect him. Every other
man had some docile girl from the village, and here he+IBk-d come with this modern
woman, a Xhosa woman no less, a culture whose women were thought of as
particularly loudmouthed and promiscuous. The two of them fought and bickered
the whole time, and after that first trip my mother refused to go back.
     Up to that point I+IBk-d lived my whole life in a world run by women, but after my
mom and Abel were married, and especially after Andrew was born, I watched
him try to assert himself and impose his ideas of what he thought his family
should be. One thing that became clear early on was that those ideas did not
include me. I was a reminder that my mom had lived a life before him. I didn+IBk-t
even share his color. His family was him, my mom, and the new baby. My family
was my mom and me. I actually appreciated that about him. Sometimes he was
my buddy, sometimes not, but he never pretended our relationship was anything
other than what it was. We+IBk-d joke around and laugh together. We+IBk-d watch TV
together. He+IBk-d slip me pocket money now and again after my mother said I+IBk-d had
enough. But he never gave me a birthday present or a Christmas present. He never
gave me the affection of a father. I was never his son.
    Abel+IBk-s presence in the house brought with it new rules. One of the first things
he did was kick Fufi and Panther out of the house.
    +IBw-No dogs in the house.+IB0-
    +IBw-But we+IBk-ve always had the dogs in the house.+IB0-
    +IBw-Not anymore. In an African home, dogs sleep outside. People sleep inside.+IB0-
    Putting the dogs in the yard was Abel+IBk-s way of saying, +IBw-We+IBk-re going to do
things around here the way they+IBk-re supposed to be done.+IB0- When they were just
dating, my mother was still the free spirit, doing what she wanted, going where
she wanted. Slowly, those things got reined in. I could feel that he was trying to
rein in our independence. He even got upset about church. +IBw-You cannot be at
church the whole day,+IB0- he+IBk-d say. +IBw-My wife is gone all day, and what will people
say? +IBg-Why is his wife not around? Where is she? Who goes to church for the whole
day?+IBk- No, no, no. This brings disrespect to me.+IB0-
    He tried to stop her from spending so much time at church, and one of the
most effective tools he used was to stop fixing my mother+IBk-s car. It would break
down, and he+IBk-d purposefully let it sit. My mom couldn+IBk-t afford another car, and
she couldn+IBk-t get the car fixed somewhere else. You+IBk-re married to a mechanic and
you+IBk-re going to get your car fixed by another mechanic? That+IBk-s worse than
cheating. So Abel became our only transport, and he would refuse to take us
places. Ever defiant, my mother would take minibuses to get to church.
     Losing the car also meant losing access to my dad. We had to ask Abel for
rides into town, and he didn+IBk-t like what they were for. It was an insult to his
manhood.
    +IBw-We need to go to Yeoville.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why are you going to Yeoville?+IB0-
    +IBw-To see Trevor+IBk-s dad.+IB0-
      +IBw-What? No, no. How can I take my wife and her child and drop you off there?
You+IBk-re insulting me. What do I tell my friends? What do I tell my family? My wife
is at another man+IBk-s house? The man who made that child with her? No, no, no.+IB0-
    I saw my father less and less. Not long after, he moved down to Cape Town.
      Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I
wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was
the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were
plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my
mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient,
but he never falls in love with subservient women. He+IBk-s attracted to independent
women. +IBw-He+IBk-s like an exotic bird collector,+IB0- she said. +IBw-He only wants a woman who
is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.+IB0-
                                         +IBQ-
When we first met Abel, he smoked a lot of weed. He drank, too, but it was mostly
weed. Looking back, I almost miss his pothead days because the weed mellowed
him out. He+IBk-d smoke, chill, watch TV, and fall asleep. I think subconsciously it was
something he knew he needed to do to take the edge off his anger. He stopped
smoking after he and my mom got married. She made him stop for religious
reasons+IBQ-the body is a temple and so on. But what none of us saw coming was that
when he stopped smoking weed he just replaced it with alcohol. He started
drinking more and more. He never came home from work sober. An average day
was a six-pack of beer after work. Weeknights he+IBk-d have a buzz on. Some Fridays
and Saturdays he just didn+IBk-t come home.
     When Abel drank, his eyes would go red, bloodshot. That was the clue I
learned to read. I always thought of Abel as a cobra: calm, perfectly still, then
explosive. There was no ranting and raving, no clenched fists. He+IBk-d be very quiet,
and then out of nowhere the violence would come. The eyes were my only clue to
stay away. His eyes were everything. They were the eyes of the Devil.
    Late one night we woke up to a house filled with smoke. Abel hadn+IBk-t come
home by the time we+IBk-d gone to bed, and I+IBk-d fallen asleep in my mother+IBk-s room with
her and Andrew, who was still a baby. I jerked awake to her shaking me and
screaming. +IBw-Trevor+ACE- Trevor+ACEgHQ- There was smoke everywhere. We thought the house
was burning down.
     My mom ran down the hallway to the kitchen, where she discovered the
kitchen on fire. Abel had driven home drunk, blind drunk, drunker than we+IBk-d ever
seen him before. He+IBk-d been hungry, tried to heat up some food on the stove, and
passed out on the couch while it was cooking. The pot had burned itself out and
burned up the kitchen wall behind the stove, and smoke was billowing
everywhere. She turned off the stove and opened the doors and the windows to try
to air the place out. Then she went over to the couch and woke him up and started
berating him for nearly burning the house down. He was too drunk to care.
    She came back into the bedroom, picked up the phone, and called my
grandmother. She started going on and on about Abel and his drinking. +IBw-This
man, he+IBk-s going to kill us one day. He almost burnt the house down+ICYgHQ-
      Abel walked into the bedroom, very calm, very quiet. His eyes were blood red,
his eyelids heavy. He put his finger on the cradle and hung up the call. My mom
lost it.
    +IBw-How dare you+ACE- Don+IBk-t you hang up my phone call+ACE- What do you think you+IBk-re
doing?+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-You don+IBk-t tell people what+IBk-s happening in this house,+IB0- he said.
     +IBw-Oh, please+ACE- You+IBk-re worried about what the world is thinking? Worry about
this world+ACE- Worry about what your family is thinking+ACEgHQ-
    Abel towered over my mother. He didn+IBk-t raise his voice, didn+IBk-t get angry.
    +IBw-Mbuyi,+IB0- he said softly, +IBw-you don+IBk-t respect me.+IB0-
    +IBw-Respect?+ACE- You almost burned down our house. Respect? Oh, please+ACE- Earn
your respect+ACE- You want me to respect you as a man, then act like a man+ACE- Drinking
your money in the streets, and where are your child+IBk-s diapers?+ACE- Respect?+ACE- Earn
your respect+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mbuyi+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-You+IBk-re not a man+ADs- you+IBk-re a child+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mbuyi+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-I can+IBk-t have a child for a husband+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mbuyi+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-I+IBk-ve got my own children to raise+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mbuyi, shut up+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-A man who comes home drunk+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mbuyi, shut up+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-And burns down the house with his children+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Mbuyi, shut up+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-And you call yourself a father+IBQgHQ-
     Then out of nowhere, like a clap of thunder when there were no clouds,
crack+ACE-, he smacked her across the face. She ricocheted off the wall and collapsed
like a ton of bricks. I+IBk-d never seen anything like it. She went down and stayed
down for a good thirty seconds. Andrew started screaming. I don+IBk-t remember
going to pick him up, but I clearly remember holding him at some point. My mom
pulled herself up and struggled back to her feet and launched right back into him.
She+IBk-d clearly been knocked for a loop, but she was trying to act more with-it than
she was. I could see the disbelief in her face. This had never happened to her
before in her life. She got right back in his face and started shouting at him.
    +IBw-Did you just hit me?+IB0-
     The whole time, in my head, I kept thinking the same thing Abel was saying.
Shut up, Mom. Shut up. You+IBk-re going to make it worse. Because I knew, as the
receiver of many beatings, the one thing that doesn+IBk-t help is talking back. But she
wouldn+IBk-t stay quiet.
    +IBw-Did you just hit me?+IB0-
    +IBw-Mbuyi, I told you+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-No man has ever+ACE- Don+IBk-t think you can control me when you can+IBk-t even
control+IBQgHQ-
    Crack+ACE- He hit her again. She stumbled back but this time didn+IBk-t fall. She
scrambled, grabbed me, and grabbed Andrew.
    +IBw-Let+IBk-s go. We+IBk-re leaving.+IB0-
    We ran out of the house and up the road. It was the dead of night, cold
outside. I was wearing nothing but a T-shirt and sweatpants. We walked to the
Eden Park police station, over a kilometer away. My mom marched us in, and
there were two cops on duty at the front desk.
    +IBw-I+IBk-m here to lay a charge,+IB0- she said.
       +IBw-What are you here to lay a charge about?+IB0-
       +IBw-I+IBk-m here to lay a charge against the man who hit me.+IB0-
       To this day I+IBk-ll never forget the patronizing, condescending way they spoke to
her.
       +IBw-Calm down, lady. Calm down. Who hit you?+IB0-
       +IBw-My husband.+IB0-
       +IBw-Your husband? What did you do? Did you make him angry?+IB0-
       +IBw-Did I+ICY-what? No. He hit me. I+IBk-m here to lay a charge against+IBQgHQ-
     +IBw-No, no. Ma+IBk-am. Why do you wanna make a case, eh? You sure you want to do
this? Go home and talk to your husband. You do know once you lay charges you
can+IBk-t take them back? He+IBk-ll have a criminal record. His life will never be the same.
Do you really want your husband going to jail?+IB0-
    My mom kept insisting that they take a statement and open a case, and they
actually refused+IBQ-they refused to write up a charge sheet.
   +IBw-This is a family thing,+IB0- they said. +IBw-You don+IBk-t want to involve the police.
Maybe you want to think it over and come back in the morning.+IB0-
     Mom started yelling at them, demanding to see the station commander, and
right then Abel walked into the station. He+IBk-d driven down. He+IBk-d sobered up a bit,
but he was still drunk, driving into a police station. That didn+IBk-t matter. He walked
over to the cops, and the station turned into a boys+IBk- club. Like they were a bunch
of old pals.
     +IBw-Hey, guys,+IB0- he said. +IBw-You know how it is. You know how women can be. I just
got a little angry, that+IBk-s all.+IB0-
       +IBw-It+IBk-s okay, man. We know. It happens. Don+IBk-t worry.+IB0-
     I had never seen anything like it. I was nine years old, and I still thought of
the police as the good guys. You get in trouble, you call the police, and those
flashing red-and-blue lights are going to come and save you. But I remember
standing there watching my mom, flabbergasted, horrified that these cops
wouldn+IBk-t help her. That+IBk-s when I realized the police were not who I thought they
were. They were men first, and police second.
    We left the station. My mother took me and Andrew, and we went out to stay
with my grandmother in Soweto for a while. A few weeks later, Abel drove over
and apologized. Abel was always sincere and heartfelt with his apologies: He
didn+IBk-t mean it. He knows he was wrong. He+IBk-ll never do it again. My grandmother
convinced my mom that she should give Abel a second chance. Her argument was
basically, +IBw-All men do it.+IB0- My grandfather, Temperance, had hit her. Leaving Abel
was no guarantee it wouldn+IBk-t happen again, and at least Abel was willing to
apologize. So my mom decided to give him another chance. We drove back to
Eden Park together, and for years, nothing+IBQ-for years Abel didn+IBk-t lay a finger on
her. Or me. Everything went back to the way it was.
                                         +IBQ-
Abel was an amazing mechanic, probably one of the best around at the time. He+IBk-d
been to technical college, graduated first in his class. He+IBk-d had job offers from
BMW and Mercedes. His business thrived on referrals. People would bring their
cars from all over the city for him to fix because he could work miracles on them.
My mom truly believed in him. She thought she could raise him up, help him
make good on his potential, not merely as a mechanic but as the owner of his own
workshop.
     As headstrong and independent as my mom is, she remains the woman who
gives back. She gives and gives and gives+ADs- that is her nature. She refused to be
subservient to Abel at home, but she did want him to succeed as a man. If she
could make their marriage a true marriage of equals, she was willing to pour
herself into it completely, the same way she poured herself into her children. At
some point, Abel+IBk-s boss decided to sell Mighty Mechanics and retire. My mom had
some money saved, and she helped Abel buy it. They moved the workshop from
Yeoville to the industrial area of Wynberg, just west of Alex, and Mighty
Mechanics became the new family business.
    When you first go into business there are so many things nobody tells you.
That+IBk-s especially true when you+IBk-re two young black people, a secretary and a
mechanic, coming out of a time when blacks had never been allowed to own
businesses at all. One of the things nobody tells you is that when you buy a
business you buy its debt. After my mom and Abel opened up the books on Mighty
Mechanics and came to a full realization of what they+IBk-d bought, they saw how
much trouble the company was already in.
     The garage gradually took over our lives. I+IBk-d get out of school and walk the
five kilometers from Maryvale to the workshop. I+IBk-d sit for hours and try to do my
homework with the machines and repairs going on around me. Inevitably Abel
would get behind schedule on a car, and since he was our ride, we+IBk-d have to wait
for him to finish before we could go home. It started out as +IBw-We+IBk-re running late.
Go nap in a car, and we+IBk-ll tell you when we+IBk-re leaving.+IB0- I+IBk-d crawl in the backseat of
some sedan, they+IBk-d wake me up at midnight, and we+IBk-d drive all the way back out to
Eden Park and crash. Then pretty soon it was +IBw-We+IBk-re running late. Go sleep in a
car, and we+IBk-ll wake you for school in the morning.+IB0- We started sleeping at the
garage. At first it was one or two nights a week, then three or four. Then my mom
sold the house and put that money into the business as well. She went all in. She
gave up everything for him.
     From that point on we lived in the garage. It was a warehouse, basically, and
not the fancy, romantic sort of warehouse hipsters might one day turn into lofts.
No, no. It was a cold, empty space. Gray concrete floors stained with oil and
grease, old junk cars and car parts everywhere. Near the front, next to the roller
door that opened onto the street, there was a tiny office built out of drywall for
doing paperwork and such. In the back was a kitchenette, just a sink, a portable
hot plate, and some cabinets. To bathe, there was only an open wash basin, like a
janitor+IBk-s sink, with a showerhead rigged up above.
      Abel and my mom slept with Andrew in the office on a thin mattress they+IBk-d
roll out on the floor. I slept in the cars. I got really good at sleeping in cars. I know
all the best cars to sleep in. The worst were the cheap ones, Volkswagens, low-end
Japanese sedans. The seats barely reclined, no headrests, cheap fake-leather
upholstery. I+IBk-d spend half the night trying not to slide off the seat. I+IBk-d wake up with
sore knees because I couldn+IBk-t stretch out and extend my legs. German cars were
wonderful, especially Mercedes. Big, plush leather seats, like couches. They were
cold when you first climbed in, but they were well insulated and warmed up nicely.
All I needed was my school blazer to curl up under, and I could get really cozy
inside a Mercedes. But the best, hands-down, were American cars. I used to pray
for a customer to come in with a big Buick with bench seats. If I saw one of those,
I+IBk-d be like, Yes+ACE- It was rare for American cars to come in, but when they did, boy,
was I in heaven.
     Since Mighty Mechanics was now a family business, and I was family, I also
had to work. There was no more time for play. There wasn+IBk-t even time for
homework. I+IBk-d walk home, the school uniform would come off, the overalls would
go on, and I+IBk-d get under the hood of some sedan. I got to a point where I could do
a basic service on a car by myself, and often I did. Abel would say, +IBw-That Honda.
Minor service.+IB0- And I+IBk-d get under the hood. Day in and day out. Points, plugs,
condensers, oil filters, air filters. Install new seats, change tires, swap headlights,
fix taillights. Go to the parts shop, buy the parts, back to the workshop. Eleven
years old, and that was my life. I was falling behind in school. I wasn+IBk-t getting
anything done. My teachers used to come down on me.
    +IBw-Why aren+IBk-t you doing your homework?+IB0-
    +IBw-I can+IBk-t do my homework. I have work, at home.+IB0-
     We worked and worked and worked, but no matter how many hours we put
in, the business kept losing money. We lost everything. We couldn+IBk-t even afford
real food. There was one month I+IBk-ll never forget, the worst month of my life. We
were so broke that for weeks we ate nothing but bowls of marogo, a kind of wild
spinach, cooked with caterpillars. Mopane worms, they+IBk-re called. Mopane worms
are literally the cheapest thing that only the poorest of poor people eat. I grew up
poor, but there+IBk-s poor and then there+IBk-s +IBw-Wait, I+IBk-m eating worms.+IB0- Mopane worms
are the sort of thing where even people in Soweto would be like, +IBw-Eh+ICY-no.+IB0- They+IBk-re
these spiny, brightly colored caterpillars the size of your finger. They+IBk-re nothing
like escargot, where someone took a snail and gave it a fancy name. They+IBk-re
fucking worms. They have black spines that prick the roof of your mouth as you+IBk-re
eating them. When you bite into a mopane worm, it+IBk-s not uncommon for its
yellow-green excrement to squirt into your mouth.
     For a while I sort of enjoyed the caterpillars. It was like a food adventure, but
then over the course of weeks, eating them every day, day after day, I couldn+IBk-t take
it anymore. I+IBk-ll never forget the day I bit a mopane worm in half and that yellow-
green ooze came out and I thought, +IBw-I+IBk-m eating caterpillar shit.+IB0- Instantly I wanted
to throw up. I snapped and ran to my mom crying. +IBw-I don+IBk-t want to eat caterpillars
anymore+ACEgHQ- That night she scraped some money together and bought us chicken.
As poor as we+IBk-d been in the past, we+IBk-d never been without food.
     That was the period of my life I hated the most+IBQ-work all night, sleep in some
car, wake up, wash up in a janitor+IBk-s sink, brush my teeth in a little metal basin,
brush my hair in the rearview mirror of a Toyota, then try to get dressed without
getting oil and grease all over my school clothes so the kids at school won+IBk-t know I
live in a garage. Oh, I hated it so much. I hated cars. I hated sleeping in cars. I
hated working on cars. I hated getting my hands dirty. I hated eating worms. I
hated it all.
     I didn+IBk-t hate my mom, or even Abel, funnily enough. Because I saw how hard
everyone was working. At first I didn+IBk-t know about the mistakes being made on
the business level that were making it hard, so it just felt like a hard situation. But
eventually I started to see why the business was hemorrhaging money. I used to go
around and buy auto parts for Abel, and I learned that he was buying his parts on
credit. The vendors were charging him a crazy markup. The debt was crippling the
company, and instead of paying off the debt he was drinking what little cash he
made. Brilliant mechanic, horrible businessman.
     At a certain point, in order to try to save the garage, my mother quit her job at
ICI and stepped in to help him run the workshop. She brought her office skills to
the garage full-time and started keeping the books, making the schedule,
balancing the accounts. And it was going well, until Abel started to feel like she
was running his business. People started commenting on it as well. Clients were
getting their cars on time, vendors were getting paid on time, and they would say,
+IBw-Hey, Abie, this workshop is going so much better now that your wife has taken
over.+IB0- That didn+IBk-t help.
     We lived in the workshop for close to a year, and then my mom had had
enough. She was willing to help him, but not if he was going to drink all the
profits. She had always been independent, self-sufficient, but she+IBk-d lost that part
of herself at the mercy of someone else+IBk-s failed dream. At a certain point she said,
+IBw-I can+IBk-t do this anymore. I+IBk-m out of this. I+IBk-m done.+IB0- She went out and got a job as a
secretary with a real-estate developer, and somehow, between that and borrowing
against whatever equity was left in Abel+IBk-s workshop, she was able to get us the
house in Highlands North. We moved, the workshop was seized by Abel+IBk-s
creditors, and that was the end of that.
                                          +IBQ-
Growing up I suffered no shortage of my mother+IBk-s old school, Old Testament
discipline. She spared no rod and spoiled no child. With Andrew, she was
different. He got spankings at first, but they tapered off and eventually went away.
When I asked her why I got beatings and Andrew didn+IBk-t, she made a joke about it
like she does with everything. +IBw-I beat you like that because you could take it,+IB0- she
said. +IBw-I can+IBk-t hit your little brother the same way because he+IBk-s a skinny little stick.
He+IBk-ll break. But you, God gave you that ass for whipping.+IB0- Even though she was
kidding, I could tell that the reason she didn+IBk-t beat Andrew was because she+IBk-d had
a genuine change of heart on the matter. It was a lesson she+IBk-d learned, oddly
enough, from me.
     I grew up in a world of violence, but I myself was never violent at all. Yes, I
played pranks and set fires and broke windows, but I never attacked people. I
never hit anyone. I was never angry. I just didn+IBk-t see myself that way. My mother
had exposed me to a different world than the one she grew up in. She bought me
the books she never got to read. She took me to the schools that she never got to
go to. I immersed myself in those worlds and I came back looking at the world a
different way. I saw that not all families are violent. I saw the futility of violence,
the cycle that just repeats itself, the damage that+IBk-s inflicted on people that they in
turn inflict on others.
     I saw, more than anything, that relationships are not sustained by violence
but by love. Love is a creative act. When you love someone you create a new world
for them. My mother did that for me, and with the progress I made and the things
I learned, I came back and created a new world and a new understanding for her.
After that, she never raised her hand to her children again. Unfortunately, by the
time she stopped, Abel had started.
    In all the times I received beatings from my mom, I was never scared of her. I
didn+IBk-t like it, certainly. When she said, +IBw-I hit you out of love,+IB0- I didn+IBk-t necessarily
agree with her thinking. But I understood that it was discipline and it was being
done for a purpose. The first time Abel hit me I felt something I had never felt
before. I felt terror.
     I was in grade six, my last year at Maryvale. We+IBk-d moved to Highlands North,
and I+IBk-d gotten in trouble at school for forging my mom+IBk-s signature on some
document+ADs- there was some activity I didn+IBk-t want to participate in, so I+IBk-d signed the
release in her name to get out of it. The school called my mom, and she asked me
about it when I got home that afternoon. I was certain she was going to punish me,
but this turned out to be one of those times when she didn+IBk-t care. She said I should
have just asked her+ADs- she would have signed the form anyway. Then Abel, who+IBk-d
been sitting in the kitchen with us, watching the whole thing, said, +IBw-Hey, can I talk
to you for a second?+IB0- Then he took me into this tiny room, a walk-in pantry off the
kitchen, and he closed the door behind us.
    He was standing between me and the door, but I didn+IBk-t think anything of it. It
didn+IBk-t occur to me to be scared. Abel had never tried to discipline me before. He+IBk-d
never even given me a lecture. It was always +IBw-Mbuyi, your son did this,+IB0- and then
my mother would handle it. And this was the middle of the afternoon. He was
completely sober, which made what happened next all the more terrifying.
    +IBw-Why did you forge your mother+IBk-s signature?+IB0- he said.
    I started making up some excuse. +IBw-Oh, I, uh, forgot to bring the form home+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Don+IBk-t lie to me. Why did you forge your mom+IBk-s signature?+IB0-
    I started stammering out more bullshit, oblivious to what was coming, and
then out of nowhere it came.
     The first blow hit me in the ribs. My mind flashed: It+IBk-s a trap+ACE- I+IBk-d never been
in a fight before, had never learned how to fight, but I had this instinct that told
me to get in close. I had seen what those long arms could do. I+IBk-d seen him take
down my mom, but more important, I+IBk-d seen him take down grown men. Abel
never hit people with a punch+ADs- I never saw him punch another person with a
closed fist. But he had this ability to hit a grown man across his face with an open
hand and they+IBk-d crumple. He was that strong. I looked at his arms and I knew,
Don+IBk-t be on the other end of those things. I ducked in close and he kept hitting and
hitting, but I was in too tight for him to land any solid blows. Then he caught on
and he stopped hitting and started trying to grapple and wrestle me. He did this
thing where he grabbed the skin on my arms and pinched it between his thumb
and forefinger and twisted hard. Jesus, that hurt.
     It was the most terrifying moment of my life. I had never been that scared
before, ever. Because there was no purpose to it+IBQ-that+IBk-s what made it so terrifying.
It wasn+IBk-t discipline. Nothing about it was coming from a place of love. It didn+IBk-t feel
like something that would end with me learning a lesson about forging my mom+IBk-s
signature. It felt like something that would end when he wanted it to end, when
his rage was spent. It felt like there was something inside him that wanted to
destroy me.
     Abel was much bigger and stronger than me, but being in a confined space
was to my advantage because he didn+IBk-t have the room to maneuver. As he
grappled and punched I somehow managed to twist and wriggle my way around
him and slip out the door. I was quick, but Abel was quick as well. He chased me. I
ran out of the house and jumped over the gate, and I ran and I ran and I ran. The
last time I turned around he was rounding the gate, coming out of the yard after
me. Until I turned twenty-five years old, I had a recurring nightmare of the look
on his face as he came around that corner.
     The moment I saw him I put my head down and ran. I ran like the Devil was
chasing me. Abel was bigger and faster, but this was my neighborhood. You
couldn+IBk-t catch me in my neighborhood. I knew every alley and every street, every
wall to climb over, every fence to slip through. I was ducking through traffic,
cutting through yards. I have no idea when he gave up because I never looked
back. I ran and ran and ran, as far as my legs would carry me. I was in Bramley,
three neighborhoods away, before I stopped. I found a hiding place in some
bushes and crawled inside and huddled there for what felt like hours.
     You don+IBk-t have to teach me a lesson twice. From that day until the day I left
home, I lived like a mouse in that house. If Abel was in a room, I was out of the
room. If he was in one corner, I was in the other corner. If he walked into a room,
I would get up and act like I was going to the kitchen, then when I reentered the
room, I would make sure I was close to the exit. He could be in the happiest,
friendliest mood. Didn+IBk-t matter. Never again did I let him come between me and a
door. Maybe a couple of times after that I was sloppy and he+IBk-d land a punch or a
kick before I could get away, but I never trusted him again, not for a moment.
     It was different for Andrew. Andrew was Abel+IBk-s son, flesh of his flesh, blood of
his blood. Despite being nine years younger than me, Andrew was really the eldest
son in that house, Abel+IBk-s firstborn, and that accorded him a respect that I and even
my mother never enjoyed. And Andrew had nothing but love for that man, despite
his shortcomings. Because of that love, I think, out of all of us, Andrew was the
only one who wasn+IBk-t afraid. He was the lion tamer, only he+IBk-d been raised by the
lion+IBQ-he couldn+IBk-t love the beast any less despite knowing what it was capable of.
For me, the first glint of anger or madness from Abel and I was gone. Andrew
would stay and try to talk Abel down. He+IBk-d even get between Abel and Mom. I
remember one night when Abel threw a bottle of Jack Daniel+IBk-s at Andrew+IBk-s head.
It just missed him and exploded on the wall. Which is to say that Andrew stayed
long enough to get the bottle thrown at him. I wouldn+IBk-t have stuck around long
enough for Abel to get a bead on me.
                                         +IBQ-
When Mighty Mechanics went under, Abel had to get his cars out. Someone was
taking over the property+ADs- there were liens against his assets. It was a mess. That+IBk-s
when he started running his workshop out of our yard. It+IBk-s also when my mother
divorced him.
     In African culture there+IBk-s legal marriage and traditional marriage. Just
because you divorce someone legally doesn+IBk-t mean they are no longer your spouse.
Once Abel+IBk-s debts and his terrible business decisions started impacting my
mother+IBk-s credit and her ability to support her sons, she wanted out. +IBw-I don+IBk-t have
debts,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I don+IBk-t have bad credit. I+IBk-m not doing these things with you.+IB0- We
were still a family and they were still traditionally married, but she divorced him
in order to separate their financial affairs. She also took her name back.
     Because Abel had started running an unlicensed business in a residential
area, one of the neighbors filed a petition to get rid of us. My mom applied for a
license to be able to operate a business on the property. The workshop stayed, but
Abel kept running it into the ground, drinking his money. At the same time, my
mother started moving up at the real-estate company she worked for, taking on
more responsibilities and earning a better salary. His workshop became like a side
hobby almost. He was supposed to pay for Andrew+IBk-s school fees and groceries, but
he started falling behind even on that, and soon my mom was paying for
everything. She paid the electricity. She paid the mortgage. He literally
contributed nothing.
    That was the turning point. When my mother started making more money
and getting her independence back+IBQ-that+IBk-s when we saw the dragon emerge. The
drinking got worse. He grew more and more violent. It wasn+IBk-t long after coming
for me in the pantry that Abel hit my mom for the second time. I can+IBk-t recall the
details of it, because now it+IBk-s muddled with all the other times that came after it. I
do remember that the police were called. They came out to the house this time, but
again it was like a boys+IBk- club. +IBw-Hey, guys. These women, you know how they are.+IB0-
No report was made. No charges were filed.
     Whenever he+IBk-d hit her or come after me, my mom would find me crying
afterward and take me aside. She+IBk-d give me the same talk every time.
    +IBw-Pray for Abel,+IB0- she+IBk-d say. +IBw-Because he doesn+IBk-t hate us. He hates himself.+IB0-
     To a kid this makes no sense. +IBw-Well, if he hates himself,+IB0- I+IBk-d say, +IBw-why doesn+IBk-t
he kick himself?+IB0-
    Abel was one of those drinkers where once he was gone you+IBk-d look into his
eyes and you didn+IBk-t even see the same person. I remember one night he came
home fuckdrunk, stumbling through the house. He stumbled into my room,
muttering to himself, and I woke up to see him whip out his dick and start pissing
on the floor. He thought he was in the bathroom. That+IBk-s how drunk he would get+IBQ-
he wouldn+IBk-t know which room in the house he was in. There were so many nights
he would stumble into my room thinking it was his and kick me out of bed and
pass out. I+IBk-d yell at him, but it was like talking to a zombie. I+IBk-d go sleep on the
couch.
    He+IBk-d get wasted with his crew in the backyard every evening after work, and
many nights he+IBk-d end up fighting with one of them. Someone would say something
Abel didn+IBk-t like, and he+IBk-d beat the shit out of him. The guy wouldn+IBk-t show up for
work Tuesday or Wednesday, but then by Thursday he+IBk-d be back because he
needed the job. Every few weeks it was the same story, like clockwork.
     Abel kicked the dogs, too. Fufi, mostly. Panther was smart enough to stay
away, but dumb, lovable Fufi was forever trying to be Abel+IBk-s friend. She+IBk-d cross his
path or be in his way when he+IBk-d had a few, and he+IBk-d give her the boot. After that
she+IBk-d go and hide somewhere for a while. Fufi getting kicked was always the
warning sign that shit was about to go down. The dogs and the workers in the yard
often got the first taste of his anger, and that would let the rest of us know to lie
low. I+IBk-d usually go find Fufi wherever she was hiding and be with her.
     The strange thing was that when Fufi got kicked she never yelped or cried.
When the vet diagnosed her as deaf, he also found out she had some condition
where she didn+IBk-t have a fully developed sense of touch. She didn+IBk-t feel pain. Which
was why she would always start over with Abel like it was a new day. He+IBk-d kick
her, she+IBk-d hide, then she+IBk-d be right back the next morning, wagging her tail. +IBw-Hey.
I+IBk-m here. I+IBk-ll give you another chance.+IB0-
     And he always got the second chance. The Abel who was likable and charming
never went away. He had a drinking problem, but he was a nice guy. We had a
family. Growing up in a home of abuse, you struggle with the notion that you can
love a person you hate, or hate a person you love. It+IBk-s a strange feeling. You want
to live in a world where someone is good or bad, where you either hate them or
love them, but that+IBk-s not how people are.
     There was an undercurrent of terror that ran through the house, but the
actual beatings themselves were not that frequent. I think if they had been, the
situation would have ended sooner. Ironically, the good times in between were
what allowed it to drag out and escalate as far as it did. He hit my mom once, then
the next time was three years later, and it was just a little bit worse. Then it was
two years later, and it was just a little bit worse. Then it was a year later, and it was
just a little bit worse. It was sporadic enough to where you+IBk-d think it wouldn+IBk-t
happen again, but it was frequent enough that you never forgot it was possible.
There was a rhythm to it. I remember one time, after one terrible incident, nobody
spoke to him for over a month. No words, no eye contact, no conversations,
nothing. We moved through the house as strangers, at different times. Complete
silent treatment. Then one morning you+IBk-re in the kitchen and there+IBk-s a nod. +IBw-Hey.+IB0-
+IBw-Hey.+IB0- Then a week later it+IBk-s +IBw-Did you see the thing on the news?+IB0- +IBw-Yeah.+IB0- Then
the next week there+IBk-s a joke and a laugh. Slowly, slowly, life goes back to how it
was. Six months, a year later, you do it all again.
                                           +IBQ-
One afternoon I came home from Sandringham and my mom was very upset and
worked up.
    +IBw-This man is unbelievable,+IB0- she said.
    +IBw-What happened?+IB0-
    +IBw-He bought a gun.+IB0-
    +IBw-What? A gun? What do you mean, +IBg-He bought a gun+IBk-?+IB0-
    A gun was such a ridiculous thing in my world. In my mind, only cops and
criminals had guns. Abel had gone out and bought a 9mm Parabellum Smith +ACY-
Wesson. Sleek and black, menacing. It didn+IBk-t look cool like guns in movies. It
looked like it killed things.
    +IBw-Why did he buy a gun?+IB0- I asked.
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t know.+IB0-
    She said she+IBk-d confronted him about it, and he+IBk-d gone off on some nonsense
about the world needing to learn to respect him.
     +IBw-He thinks he+IBk-s the policeman of the world,+IB0- she said. +IBw-And that+IBk-s the problem
with the world. We have people who cannot police themselves, so they want to
police everyone else around them.+IB0-
    Not long after that, I moved out. The atmosphere had become toxic for me. I+IBk-d
reached the point where I was as big as Abel. Big enough to punch back. A father
does not fear retribution from his son, but I was not his son. He knew that. The
analogy my mom used was that there were now two male lions in the house.
+IBw-Every time he looks at you he sees your father,+IB0- she+IBk-d say. +IBw-You+IBk-re a constant
reminder of another man. He hates you, and you need to leave. You need to leave
before you become like him.+IB0-
    It was also just time for me to go. Regardless of Abel, our plan had always
been for me to move out after school. My mother never wanted me to be like my
uncle, one of those men, unemployed and still living at home with his mother. She
helped me get my flat, and I moved out. The flat was only ten minutes away from
the house, so I was always around to drop in to help with errands or have dinner
once in a while. But, most important, whatever was going on with Abel, I didn+IBk-t
have to be involved.
     At some point my mom moved to a separate bedroom in the house, and from
then on they were married in name only, not even cohabitating but coexisting.
That state of affairs lasted a year, maybe two. Andrew had turned nine, and in my
world I was counting down until he turned eighteen, thinking that would finally
free my mom from this abusive man. Then one afternoon my mom called and
asked me to come by the house. A few hours later, I popped by.
    +IBw-Trevor,+IB0- she said. +IBw-I+IBk-m pregnant.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sorry, what?+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m pregnant.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+ACEgHQ-
      Good Lord, I was furious. I was so angry. She herself seemed resolute, as
determined as ever, but with an undertone of sadness I had never seen before, like
the news had devastated her at first but she+IBk-d since reconciled herself to the reality
of it.
    +IBw-How could you let this happen?+IB0-
    +IBw-Abel and I, we made up. I moved back into the bedroom. It was just one
night, and then+ICY-I became pregnant. I don+IBk-t know how.+IB0-
    She didn+IBk-t know. She was forty-four years old. She+IBk-d had her tubes tied after
Andrew. Even her doctor had said, +IBw-This shouldn+IBk-t be possible. We don+IBk-t know
how this happened.+IB0-
     I was boiling with rage. All we had to do was wait for Andrew to grow up, and
it was going to be over, and now it was like she+IBk-d re-upped on the contract.
     +IBw-So you+IBk-re going to have this child with this man? You+IBk-re going to stay with
this man another eighteen years? Are you crazy?+IB0-
    +IBw-God spoke to me, Trevor. He told me, +IBg-Patricia, I don+IBk-t do anything by
mistake. There is nothing I give you that you cannot handle.+IBk- I+IBk-m pregnant for a
reason. I know what kind of kids I can make. I know what kind of sons I can raise.
I can raise this child. I will raise this child.+IB0-
    Nine months later Isaac was born. She called him Isaac because in the Bible
Sarah gets pregnant when she+IBk-s like a hundred years old and she+IBk-s not supposed to
be having children and that+IBk-s what she names her son.
     Isaac+IBk-s birth pushed me even further away. I visited less and less. Then I
popped by one afternoon and the house was in chaos, police cars out front, the
aftermath of another fight.
    He+IBk-d hit her with a bicycle. Abel had been berating one of his workers in the
yard, and my mom had tried to get between them. Abel was furious that she+IBk-d
contradicted him in front of an employee, so he picked up Andrew+IBk-s bike and he
beat her with it. Again she called the police, and the cops who showed up this time
actually knew Abel. He+IBk-d fixed their cars. They were pals. No charges were filed.
Nothing happened.
    That time I confronted him. I was big enough now.
    +IBw-You can+IBk-t keep doing this,+IB0- I said. +IBw-This is not right.+IB0-
    He was apologetic. He always was. He didn+IBk-t puff out his chest and get
defensive or anything like that.
    +IBw-I know,+IB0- he said. +IBw-I+IBk-m sorry. I don+IBk-t like doing these things, but you know
how your mom is. She can talk a lot and she doesn+IBk-t listen. I feel like your mom
doesn+IBk-t respect me sometimes. She came and disrespected me in front of my
workers. I can+IBk-t have these other men looking at me like I don+IBk-t know how to
control my wife.+IB0-
    After the bicycle, my mom hired contractors she knew through the real-estate
business to build her a separate house in the backyard, like a little servants+IBk-
quarters, and she moved in there with Isaac.
    +IBw-This is the most insane thing I+IBk-ve ever seen,+IB0- I told her.
     +IBw-This is all I can do,+IB0- she said. +IBw-The police won+IBk-t help me. The government
won+IBk-t protect me. Only my God can protect me. But what I can do is use against
him the one thing that he cherishes, and that is his pride. By me living outside in a
shack, everyone is going to ask him, +IBg-Why does your wife live in a shack outside
your house?+IBk- He+IBk-s going to have to answer that question, and no matter what he
says, everyone will know that something is wrong with him. He loves to live for the
world. Let the world see him for who he is. He+IBk-s a saint in the streets. He+IBk-s a devil
in this house. Let him be seen for who he is.+IB0-
     When my mom had decided to keep Isaac, I was so close to writing her off. I
couldn+IBk-t stand the pain anymore. But seeing her hit with a bicycle, living like a
prisoner in her own backyard, that was the final straw for me. I was a broken
person. I was done.
     +IBw-This thing?+IB0- I told her. +IBw-This dysfunctional thing? I won+IBk-t be a part of it. I
can+IBk-t live this life with you. I refuse. You+IBk-ve made your decision. Good luck with
your life. I+IBk-m going to live mine.+IB0-
    She understood. She didn+IBk-t feel betrayed or abandoned at all.
     +IBw-Honey, I know what you+IBk-re going through,+IB0- she said. +IBw-At one point, I had to
disown my family to go off and live my own life, too. I understand why you need to
do the same.+IB0-
     So I did. I walked out. I didn+IBk-t call. I didn+IBk-t visit. Isaac came and I went, and
for the life of me I could not understand why she wouldn+IBk-t do the same: leave. Just
leave. Just fucking leave.
    I didn+IBk-t understand what she was going through. I didn+IBk-t understand
domestic violence. I didn+IBk-t understand how adult relationships worked+ADs- I+IBk-d never
even had a girlfriend. I didn+IBk-t understand how she could have sex with a man she
hated and feared. I didn+IBk-t know how easily sex and hatred and fear can intertwine.
     I was angry with my mom. I hated him, but I blamed her. I saw Abel as a
choice she+IBk-d made, a choice she was continuing to make. My whole life, telling me
stories about growing up in the homelands, being abandoned by her parents, she
had always said, +IBw-You cannot blame anyone else for what you do. You cannot
blame your past for who you are. You are responsible for you. You make your own
choices.+IB0-
     She never let me see us as victims. We were victims, me and my mom,
Andrew and Isaac. Victims of apartheid. Victims of abuse. But I was never allowed
to think that way, and I didn+IBk-t see her life that way. Cutting my father out of our
lives to pacify Abel, that was her choice. Supporting Abel+IBk-s workshop was her
choice. Isaac was her choice. She had the money, not him. She wasn+IBk-t dependent.
So in my mind, she was the one making the decision.
     It is so easy, from the outside, to put the blame on the woman and say, +IBw-You
just need to leave.+IB0- It+IBk-s not like my home was the only home where there was
domestic abuse. It+IBk-s what I grew up around. I saw it in the streets of Soweto, on
TV, in movies. Where does a woman go in a society where that is the norm? When
the police won+IBk-t help her? When her own family won+IBk-t help her? Where does a
woman go when she leaves one man who hits her and is just as likely to wind up
with another man who hits her, maybe even worse than the first? Where does a
woman go when she+IBk-s single with three kids and she lives in a society that makes
her a pariah for being a manless woman? Where she+IBk-s seen as a whore for doing
that? Where does she go? What does she do?
     But I didn+IBk-t comprehend any of that at the time. I was a boy with a boy+IBk-s
understanding of things. I distinctly remember the last time we argued about it,
too. It was sometime after the bicycle, or when she was moving into her shack in
the backyard. I was going off, begging her for the thousandth time.
    +IBw-Why? Why don+IBk-t you just leave?+IB0-
    She shook her head. +IBw-Oh, baby. No, no, no. I can+IBk-t leave.+IB0-
    +IBw-Why not?+IB0-
    +IBw-Because if I leave he+IBk-ll kill us.+IB0-
    She wasn+IBk-t being dramatic. She didn+IBk-t raise her voice. She said it totally calm
and matter-of-fact, and I never asked her that question again.
                                          +IBQ-
Eventually she did leave. What prompted her to leave, what the final breaking
point was, I have no idea. I was gone. I was off becoming a comedian, touring the
country, playing shows in England, hosting radio shows, hosting television shows.
I+IBk-d moved in with my cousin Mlungisi and made my own life separate from hers. I
couldn+IBk-t invest myself anymore, because it would have broken me into too many
pieces. But one day she bought another house in Highlands North, met someone
new, and moved on with her life. Andrew and Isaac still saw their dad, who, by
that point, was just existing in the world, still going through the same cycle of
drinking and fighting, still living in a house paid for by his ex-wife.
    Years passed. Life carried on.
     Then one morning I was in bed around ten a.m. and my phone rang. It was on
a Sunday. I know it was on a Sunday because everyone else in the family had gone
to church and I, quite happily, had not. The days of endlessly schlepping back and
forth to church were no longer my problem, and I was lazily sleeping in. The irony
of my life is that whenever church is involved is when shit goes wrong, like getting
kidnapped by violent minibus drivers. I+IBk-d always teased my mom about that, too.
+IBw-This church thing of yours, all this Jesus, what good has come of it?+IB0-
    I looked over at my phone. It was flashing my mom+IBk-s number, but when I
answered, it was Andrew on the other end. He sounded perfectly calm.
    +IBw-Hey, Trevor, it+IBk-s Andrew.+IB0-
    +IBw-Hey.+IB0-
    +IBw-How are you?+IB0-
    +IBw-Good. What+IBk-s up?+IB0-
    +IBw-Are you busy?+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m sort of sleeping. Why?+IB0-
    +IBw-Mom+IBk-s been shot.+IB0-
     Okay, so there were two strange things about the call. First, why would he ask
me if I was busy? Let+IBk-s start there. When your mom+IBk-s been shot, the first line out
of your mouth should be +IBw-Mom+IBk-s been shot.+IB0- Not +IBw-How are you?+IB0- Not +IBw-Are you
busy?+IB0- That confused me. The second weird thing was when he said, +IBw-Mom+IBk-s been
shot,+IB0- I didn+IBk-t ask, +IBw-Who shot her?+IB0- I didn+IBk-t have to. He said, +IBw-Mom+IBk-s been shot,+IB0-
and my mind automatically filled in the rest: +IBw-Abel shot mom.+IB0-
    +IBw-Where are you now?+IB0- I said.
    +IBw-We+IBk-re at Linksfield Hospital.+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay, I+IBk-m on my way.+IB0-
    I jumped out of bed, ran down the corridor, and banged on Mlungisi+IBk-s door.
+IBw-Dude, my mom+IBk-s been shot+ACE- She+IBk-s in the hospital.+IB0- He jumped out of bed, too,
and we got in the car and raced to the hospital, which luckily was only fifteen
minutes away.
    At that point, I was upset but not terrified. Andrew had been so calm on the
phone, no crying, no panic in his voice, so I was thinking, She must be okay. It
must not be that bad. I called him back from the car to find out more.
    +IBw-Andrew, what happened?+IB0-
    +IBw-We were on our way home from church,+IB0- he said, again totally calm. +IBw-And
Dad was waiting for us at the house, and he got out of his car and started
shooting.+IB0-
    +IBw-But where? Where did he shoot her?+IB0-
    +IBw-He shot her in her leg.+IB0-
    +IBw-Oh, okay,+IB0- I said, relieved.
    +IBw-And then he shot her in the head.+IB0-
      When he said that, my body just let go. I remember the exact traffic light I
was at. For a moment there was a complete vacuum of sound, and then I cried
tears like I had never cried before. I collapsed in heaving sobs and moans. I cried
as if every other thing I+IBk-d cried for in my life had been a waste of crying. I cried so
hard that if my present crying self could go back in time and see my other crying
selves, it would slap them and say, +IBw-That shit+IBk-s not worth crying for.+IB0- My cry was
not a cry of sadness. It was not catharsis. It wasn+IBk-t me feeling sorry for myself. It
was an expression of raw pain that came from an inability of my body to express
that pain in any other way, shape, or form. She was my mom. She was my
teammate. It had always been me and her together, me and her against the world.
When Andrew said, +IBw-shot her in the head,+IB0- I broke in two.
     The light changed. I couldn+IBk-t even see the road, but I drove through the tears,
thinking, Just get there, just get there, just get there. We pulled up to the hospital,
and I jumped out of the car. There was an outdoor sitting area by the entrance to
the emergency room. Andrew was standing there waiting for me, alone, his clothes
smeared with blood. He still looked perfectly calm, completely stoic. Then the
moment he looked up and saw me he broke down and started bawling. It was like
he+IBk-d been holding it together the whole morning and then everything broke loose
at once and he lost it. I ran to him and hugged him and he cried and cried. His cry
was different from mine, though. My cry was one of pain and anger. His cry was
one of helplessness.
    I turned and ran into the emergency room. My mom was there in triage on a
gurney. The doctors were stabilizing her. Her whole body was soaked in blood.
There was a hole in her face, a gaping wound above her lip, part of her nose gone.
    She was as calm and serene as I+IBk-d ever seen her. She could still open one eye,
and she turned and looked up at me and saw the look of horror on my face.
    +IBw-It+IBk-s okay, baby,+IB0- she whispered, barely able to speak with the blood in her
throat.
    +IBw-It+IBk-s not okay.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, no, I+IBk-m okay, I+IBk-m okay. Where+IBk-s Andrew? Where+IBk-s your brother?+IB0-
    +IBw-He+IBk-s outside.+IB0-
    +IBw-Go to Andrew.+IB0-
    +IBw-But Mom+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Shh. It+IBk-s okay, baby. I+IBk-m fine.+IB0-
    +IBw-You+IBk-re not fine, you+IBk-re+IBQgHQ-
    +IBw-Shhhhhh. I+IBk-m fine, I+IBk-m fine, I+IBk-m fine. Go to your brother. Your brother needs
you.+IB0-
     The doctors kept working, and there was nothing I could do to help her. I
went back outside to be with Andrew. We sat down together, and he told me the
story.
     They were coming home from church, a big group, my mom and Andrew and
Isaac, her new husband and his children and a whole bunch of his extended
family, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews. They had just pulled into the
driveway when Abel pulled up and got out of his car. He had his gun. He looked
right at my mother.
     +IBw-You+IBk-ve stolen my life,+IB0- he said. +IBw-You+IBk-ve taken everything away from me. Now
I+IBk-m going to kill all of you.+IB0-
    Andrew stepped in front of his father. He stepped right in front of the gun.
    +IBw-Don+IBk-t do this, Dad, please. You+IBk-re drunk. Just put the gun away.+IB0-
    Abel looked down at his son.
    +IBw-No,+IB0- he said. +IBw-I+IBk-m killing everybody, and if you don+IBk-t walk away I will shoot
you first.+IB0-
    Andrew stepped aside.
   +IBw-His eyes were not lying,+IB0- he told me. +IBw-He had the eyes of the Devil. In that
moment I could tell my father was gone.+IB0-
    For all the pain I felt that day, in hindsight, I have to imagine that Andrew+IBk-s
pain was far greater than mine. My mom had been shot by a man I despised. If
anything, I felt vindicated+ADs- I+IBk-d been right about Abel all along. I could direct my
anger and hatred toward him with no shame or guilt whatsoever. But Andrew+IBk-s
mother had been shot by Andrew+IBk-s father, a father he loved. How does he
reconcile his love with that situation? How does he carry on loving both sides?
Both sides of himself?
    Isaac was only four years old. He didn+IBk-t fully comprehend what was
happening, and as Andrew stepped aside, Isaac started crying.
    +IBw-Daddy, what are you doing? Daddy, what are you doing?+IB0-
    +IBw-Isaac, go to your brother,+IB0- Abel said.
    Isaac ran over to Andrew, and Andrew held him. Then Abel raised his gun
and he started shooting. My mother jumped in front of the gun to protect
everyone, and that+IBk-s when she took the first bullet, not in her leg but in her butt
cheek. She collapsed, and as she fell to the ground she screamed.
    +IBw-Run+ACEgHQ-
     Abel kept shooting and everyone ran. They scattered. My mom was struggling
to get back to her feet when Abel walked up and stood over her. He pointed the
gun at her head point-blank, execution-style. Then he pulled the trigger. Nothing.
The gun misfired. Click+ACE- He pulled the trigger again, same thing. Then again and
again. Click+ACE- Click+ACE- Click+ACE- Click+ACE- Four times he pulled the trigger, and four times
the gun misfired. Bullets were popping out of the ejection port, falling out of the
gun, falling down on my mom and clattering to the ground.
    Abel stopped to see what was wrong with the gun. My mother jumped up in a
panic. She shoved him aside, ran for the car, jumped into the driver+IBk-s seat.
     Andrew ran behind and jumped into the passenger seat next to her. Just as
she turned the ignition, Andrew heard one last gunshot, and the windshield went
red. Abel had fired from behind the car. The bullet went into the back of her head
and exited through the front of her face, and blood sprayed everywhere. Her body
slumped over the steering wheel. Andrew, reacting without thinking, pulled my
mom to the passenger side, flipped over her, jumped into the driver+IBk-s seat,
slammed the car into gear, and raced to the hospital in Linksfield.
    I asked Andrew what happened to Abel. He didn+IBk-t know. I was filled with
rage, but there was nothing I could do. I felt completely impotent, but I still felt I
had to do something. So I took out my phone and I called him+IBQ-I called the man
who+IBk-d just shot my mom, and he actually picked up.
    +IBw-Trevor.+IB0-
    +IBw-You killed my mom.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes, I did.+IB0-
    +IBw-You killed my mom+ACEgHQ-
    +IBw-Yes. And if I could find you, I would kill you as well.+IB0-
    Then he hung up. It was the most chilling moment. It was terrifying.
Whatever nerve I+IBk-d worked up to call him I immediately lost. To this day I don+IBk-t
know what I was thinking. I don+IBk-t know what I expected to happen. I was just
enraged.
     I kept asking Andrew questions, trying to get more details. Then, as we were
talking, a nurse came outside looking for me.
    +IBw-Are you the family?+IB0- she asked.
    +IBw-Yes.+IB0-
   +IBw-Sir, there+IBk-s a problem. Your mother was speaking a bit at first. She+IBk-s stopped
now, but from what we+IBk-ve gathered she doesn+IBk-t have health insurance.+IB0-
    +IBw-What? No, no. That can+IBk-t be true. I know my mom has health insurance.+IB0-
    She didn+IBk-t. As it turned out, a few months prior, she+IBk-d decided, +IBw-This health
insurance is a scam. I never get sick. I+IBk-m going to cancel it.+IB0- So now she had no
health insurance.
    +IBw-We can+IBk-t treat your mother here,+IB0- the nurse said. +IBw-If she doesn+IBk-t have
insurance we have to send her to a state hospital.+IB0-
     +IBw-State hospital?+ACE- What+IBQ-no+ACE- You can+IBk-t. My mom+IBk-s been shot in the head.
You+IBk-re going to put her back on a gurney? Send her out in an ambulance? She+IBk-ll
die. You need to treat her right now.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sir, we can+IBk-t. We need a form of payment.+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m your form of payment. I+IBk-ll pay.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes, people say that, but without a guarantee+IBQgHQ-
    I pulled out my credit card.
    +IBw-Here,+IB0- I said. +IBw-Take this. I+IBk-ll pay. I+IBk-ll pay for everything.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sir, hospital can be very expensive.+IB0-
    +IBw-I don+IBk-t care.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sir, I don+IBk-t think you understand. Hospital can be really expensive.+IB0-
    +IBw-Lady, I have money. I+IBk-ll pay anything. Just help us.+IB0-
     +IBw-Sir, you don+IBk-t understand. We have to do so many tests. One test alone could
cost two, three thousand rand.+IB0-
    +IBw-Three thousan+IBQ-what? Lady, this is my mother+IBk-s life we+IBk-re talking about. I+IBk-ll
pay.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sir, you don+IBk-t understand. Your mother has been shot. In her brain. She+IBk-ll be
in ICU. One night in ICU could cost you fifteen, twenty thousand rand.+IB0-
    +IBw-Lady, are you not listening to me? This is my mother+IBk-s life. This is her life.
Take the money. Take all of it. I don+IBk-t care.+IB0-
    +IBw-Sir+ACE- You don+IBk-t understand. I+IBk-ve seen this happen. Your mother could be in
the ICU for weeks. This could cost you five hundred thousand, six hundred
thousand. Maybe even millions. You+IBk-ll be in debt for the rest of your life.+IB0-
    I+IBk-m not going to lie to you: I paused. I paused hard. In that moment, what I
heard the nurse saying was, +IBw-All of your money will be gone,+IB0- and then I started to
think, Well+ICY-what is she, fifty? That+IBk-s pretty good, right? She+IBk-s lived a good life.
     I genuinely did not know what to do. I stared at the nurse as the shock of what
she+IBk-d said sunk in. My mind raced through a dozen different scenarios. What if I
spend that money and then she dies anyway? Do I get a refund? I actually
imagined my mother, as frugal as she was, waking up from a coma and saying,
+IBw-You spent how much? You idiot. You should have saved that money to look after
your brothers.+IB0- And what about my brothers? They would be my responsibility
now. I would have to raise the family, which I couldn+IBk-t do if I was millions in debt,
and it was always my mother+IBk-s solemn vow that raising my brothers was the one
thing I would never have to do. Even as my career took off, she+IBk-d refused any help
I offered. +IBw-I don+IBk-t want you paying for your mother the same way I had to pay for
mine,+IB0- she+IBk-d say. +IBw-I don+IBk-t want you raising your brothers the same way Abel had to
raise his.+IB0-
     My mother+IBk-s greatest fear was that I would end up paying the black tax, that I
would get trapped by the cycle of poverty and violence that came before me. She
had always promised me that I would be the one to break that cycle. I would be the
one to move forward and not back. And as I looked at that nurse outside the
emergency room, I was petrified that the moment I handed her my credit card, the
cycle would just continue and I+IBk-d get sucked right back in.
     People say all the time that they+IBk-d do anything for the people they love. But
would you really? Would you do anything? Would you give everything? I don+IBk-t
know that a child knows that kind of selfless love. A mother, yes. A mother will
clutch her children and jump from a moving car to keep them from harm. She will
do it without thinking. But I don+IBk-t think the child knows how to do that, not
instinctively. It+IBk-s something the child has to learn.
    I pressed my credit card into the nurse+IBk-s hand.
    +IBw-Do whatever you have to do. Just please help my mom.+IB0-
    We spent the rest of the day in limbo, waiting, not knowing, pacing around
the hospital, family members stopping by. Several hours later, the doctor finally
came out of the emergency room to give us an update.
    +IBw-What+IBk-s happening?+IB0- I asked.
    +IBw-Your mother is stable,+IB0- he said. +IBw-She+IBk-s out of surgery.+IB0-
    +IBw-Is she going to be okay?+IB0-
    He thought for a moment about what he was going to say.
     +IBw-I don+IBk-t like to use this word,+IB0- he said, +IBw-because I+IBk-m a man of science and I
don+IBk-t believe in it. But what happened to your mother today was a miracle. I never
say that, because I hate it when people say it, but I don+IBk-t have any other way to
explain this.+IB0-
      The bullet that hit my mother in the butt, he said, was a through-and-
through. It went in, came out, and didn+IBk-t do any real damage. The other bullet
went through the back of her head, entering below the skull at the top of her neck.
It missed the spinal cord by a hair, missed the medulla oblongata, and traveled
through her head just underneath the brain, missing every major vein, artery, and
nerve. With the trajectory the bullet was on, it was headed straight for her left eye
socket and would have blown out her eye, but at the last second it slowed down,
hit her cheekbone instead, shattered her cheekbone, ricocheted off, and came out
through her left nostril. On the gurney in the emergency room, the blood had
made the wound look much worse than it was. The bullet took off only a tiny flap
of skin on the side of her nostril, and it came out clean, with no bullet fragments
left inside. She didn+IBk-t even need surgery. They stopped the bleeding, stitched her
up in back, stitched her up in front, and let her heal.
    +IBw-There was nothing we can do, because there+IBk-s nothing we need to do,+IB0- the
doctor said.
    My mother was out of the hospital in four days. She was back at work in
seven.
                                          +IBQ-
The doctors kept her sedated the rest of that day and night to rest. They told all of
us to go home. +IBw-She+IBk-s stable,+IB0- they said. +IBw-There+IBk-s nothing you can do here. Go
home and sleep.+IB0- So we did.
     I went back first thing the next morning to be with my mother in her room
and wait for her to wake up. When I walked in she was still asleep. The back of her
head was bandaged. She had stitches in her face and gauze covering her nose and
her left eye. She looked frail and weak, tired, one of the few times in my life I+IBk-d
ever seen her look that way.
     I sat close by her bed, holding her hand, waiting and watching her breathe, a
flood of thoughts going through my mind. I was still afraid I was going to lose her.
I was angry at myself for not being there, angry at the police for all the times they
didn+IBk-t arrest Abel. I told myself I should have killed him years ago, which was
ridiculous to think because I+IBk-m not capable of killing anyone, but I thought it
anyway. I was angry at the world, angry at God. Because all my mom does is pray.
If there+IBk-s a fan club for Jesus, my mom is definitely in the top 100, and this is what
she gets?
    After an hour or so of waiting, she opened her unbandaged eye. The second
she did, I lost it. I started bawling. She asked for some water and I gave her a cup,
and she leaned forward a bit to sip through the straw. I kept bawling and bawling
and bawling. I couldn+IBk-t control myself.
    +IBw-Shh,+IB0- she said. +IBw-Don+IBk-t cry, baby. Shhhhh. Don+IBk-t cry.+IB0-
    +IBw-How can I not cry, Mom? You almost died.+IB0-
     +IBw-No, I wasn+IBk-t going to die. I wasn+IBk-t going to die. It+IBk-s okay. I wasn+IBk-t going to
die.+IB0-
    +IBw-But I thought you were dead.+IB0- I kept bawling and bawling. +IBw-I thought I+IBk-d lost
you.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, baby. Baby, don+IBk-t cry. Trevor. Trevor, listen. Listen to me. Listen.+IB0-
    +IBw-What?+IB0- I said, tears streaming down my face.
    +IBw-My child, you must look on the bright side.+IB0-
     +IBw-What? What are you talking about, +IBg-the bright side+IBk-? Mom, you were shot in
the face. There is no bright side.+IB0-
    +IBw-Of course there is. Now you+IBk-re officially the best-looking person in the
family.+IB0-
     She broke out in a huge smile and started laughing. Through my tears, I
started laughing, too. I was bawling my eyes out and laughing hysterically at the
same time. We sat there and she squeezed my hand and we cracked each other up
the way we always did, mother and son, laughing together through the pain in an
intensive-care recovery room on a bright and sunny and beautiful day.
W hen my mother was shot, so much happened so quickly. We were only able to piece the
whole story together after the fact, as we collected all the different accounts from everyone
who was there. Waiting around at the hospital that day, we had so many unanswered
questions, like, What happened to Isaac? Where was Isaac? We only found out after we found
him and he told us.
    When Andrew sped off with my mom, leaving the four-year-old alone on the front lawn,
Abel walked over to his youngest, picked him up, put the boy in his car, and drove away. As
they drove, Isaac turned to his dad.
   +IBw-Dad, why did you kill Mom?+IB0- he asked, at that point assuming, as we all did, that my mom
was dead.
    +IBw-Because I+IBk-m very unhappy,+IB0- Abel replied. +IBw-Because I+IBk-m very sad.+IB0-
    +IBw-Yeah, but you shouldn+IBk-t kill Mom. Where are we going now?+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m going to drop you off at your uncle+IBk-s house.+IB0-
    +IBw-And where are you going?+IB0-
    +IBw-I+IBk-m going to kill myself.+IB0-
    +IBw-But don+IBk-t kill yourself, Dad.+IB0-
    +IBw-No, I+IBk-m going to kill myself.+IB0-
     The uncle Abel was talking about was not a real uncle but a friend. He dropped Isaac off
with this friend and then he drove off. He spent that day and went to everyone, relatives and
friends, and said his goodbyes. He even told people what he had done. +IBw-This is what I+IBk-ve done.
I+IBk-ve killed her, and I+IBk-m now on the way to kill myself. Goodbye.+IB0- He spent the whole day on this
strange farewell tour, until finally one of his cousins called him out.
   +IBw-You need to man up,+IB0- the cousin said. +IBw-This is the coward+IBk-s way. You need to turn
yourself in. If you were man enough to do this, you have to be man enough to face the
consequences.+IB0-
    Abel broke down and handed his gun over to the cousin, the cousin drove him to the police
station, and Abel turned himself in.
    He spent a couple of weeks in jail, waiting for a bail hearing. We filed a motion opposing
bail because he+IBk-d shown that he was a threat. Since Andrew and Isaac were still minors, social
workers started getting involved. We felt like the case was open-and-shut, but then one day,
after a month or so, we got a call that he+IBk-d made bail. The great irony was that he got bail
because he told the judge that if he was in jail, he couldn+IBk-t earn money to support his kids. But
he wasn+IBk-t supporting his kids+IBQ-my mom was supporting the kids.
    So Abel was out. The case slowly ground its way through the legal system, and everything
went against us. Because of my mother+IBk-s miraculous recovery, the charge was only attempted
murder. And because no domestic violence charges had ever been filed in all the times my
mother had called the police to report him, Abel had no criminal record. He got a good lawyer,
who continued to lean on the court about the fact that he had children at home who needed
him. The case never went to trial. Abel pled guilty to attempted murder. He was given three
years+IBk- probation. He didn+IBk-t serve a single day in prison. He kept joint custody of his sons. He+IBk-s
walking around Johannesburg today, completely free. The last I heard he still lives somewhere
around Highlands North, not too far from my mom.

                                               +IBQ-
The final piece of the story came from my mom, who could only tell us her side after she woke
up. She remembered Abel pulling up and pointing the gun at Andrew. She remembered falling
to the ground after getting shot in the ass. Then Abel came and stood over her and pointed his
gun at her head. She looked up and looked at him straight down the barrel of the gun. Then
she started to pray, and that+IBk-s when the gun misfired. Then it misfired again. Then it misfired
again, and again. She jumped up, shoved him away, and ran for the car. Andrew leapt in
beside her and she turned the ignition and then her memory went blank.
     To this day, nobody can explain what happened. Even the police didn+IBk-t understand.
Because it wasn+IBk-t like the gun didn+IBk-t work. It fired, and then it didn+IBk-t fire, and then it fired
again for the final shot. Anyone who knows anything about firearms will tell you that a 9mm
handgun cannot misfire in the way that gun did. But at the crime scene the police had drawn
little chalk circles all over the driveway, all with spent shell casings from the shots Abel fired,
and then these four bullets, intact, from when he was standing over my mom+IBQ-nobody knows
why.
    My mom+IBk-s total hospital bill came to 50,000 rand. I paid it the day we left. For four days
we+IBk-d been in the hospital, family members visiting, talking and hanging out, laughing and
crying. As we packed up her things to leave, I was going on about how insane the whole week
had been.
    +IBw-You+IBk-re lucky to be alive,+IB0- I told her. +IBw-I still can+IBk-t believe you didn+IBk-t have any health
insurance.+IB0-
    +IBw-Oh but I do have insurance,+IB0- she said.
    +IBw-You do?+IB0-
    +IBw-Yes. Jesus.+IB0-
    +IBw-Jesus?+IB0-
    +IBw-Jesus.+IB0-
    +IBw-Jesus is your health insurance?+IB0-
    +IBw-If God is with me, who can be against me?+IB0-
    +IBw-Okay, Mom.+IB0-
    +IBw-Trevor, I prayed. I told you I prayed. I don+IBk-t pray for nothing.+IB0-
    +IBw-You know,+IB0- I said, +IBw-for once I cannot argue with you. The gun, the bullets+IBQ-I can+IBk-t explain
any of it. So I+IBk-ll give you that much.+IB0- Then I couldn+IBk-t resist teasing her with one last little jab.
+IBw-But where was your Jesus to pay your hospital bill, hmm? I know for a fact that He didn+IBk-t pay
that.+IB0-
    She smiled and said, +IBw-You+IBk-re right. He didn+IBk-t. But He blessed me with the son who did.+IB0-
