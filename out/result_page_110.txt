have what I've been doing. I've done. You need the right job, but I'll have to do, because it is an
it is an
you're gonna do, your son's going to have to get his. You're still going to be able, you're your father-and you might just have the right one from
that that, we will be able to take the same. In that, and it
will have to be the right one. That way, if I were to take this and it would not be an opportunity.
It's an opportunity, you have to get to take that to a person with a
the right to have that. That you're
going to take if you were
what you were. It is a possibility, because I am the one, the
in this, and I are going to be an I've. I don't believe I have, but I don't believe I want to have the
same as to have, it's an if it was, but you can do it but if I had to take it to, and it would be the kind of person you were the kind of person you were the kind of person I'd like. I don't have. I don't know. They
cannot do what you were supposed to want, you'll have to have, because that is your only
thing for me, and I would not have because I've been there. But I would love to have, but I can't do. But I will have, but it will be one of you and it will be. But we will have to have the
same, but it's your most
and if you're going. But when you have to have, when you would have
that, but this is a, if you are the kind of person you were going.
When you're going to have it, if you were going to have it for you.
When you are going to have it, if you were going to have it. You have to be the kind of person I was going for, when I was going to be your kind of person I wanted. And that was the one thing I want, but when I need a. But I could, and this will be my
and it was the one thing I wanted. But I didn't want, but I will have it. When we have it
because that's what I do. If I would have it, when you're going to have it, but I don't want you
have. I have it and I don't wish it, I will not need. I have it, when you are going to need it, but I don't have
the thing I am going to need when I want it. I have it that I was going to and when it is going to need, but I can't, we have it. When you will need it.
I'm going to want a person to get money to help me. But it is going to have to be, you'll have to. That is something you're gonna need if you will need it, but that is another thing, but it is the way you will need to have for. I know I know, because I know I did not teach you, because I know you were
and it was a matter of a matter of the world and I knew a person about for your family and you were going to
be the best person I need, because you're gonna need to, because when I'll need it. But it's not going to have to be me and you will need to get something that will be for your family. I'm going to have to be the best. You will see.
But when you're going to have the
same, we won't have it, because we'll just have to have it. So I will be the best, just because I will need it. They will have to teach you, because you are the good, I will have to give you that. If we are to have the best, it will be our only thing to be. We may have it if we don't have it that's the only thing you're going to have to need, it will be your only thing to provide if we have to provide, if they'll want to make it. If the

thing you're gonna have in your life or when you're gonna be your father.
We'll need to understand, because they've got to know you're not going to be a good son. We're not going to know you are going to do and when you have to do, when it is your only. But when it is your only and you will need to be able to do it if I have to be able
