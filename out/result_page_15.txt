her name
came from. Panther had a pink nose, so she was Pink Panther and eventually just
Panther. They were two sisters who loved and hated each other. They would look
out for each other, but they would also fight all the time. Like, blood fights. Biting.
Clawing. It was a strange, gruesome relationship. She wasn't scared by it because of the color
the Panthers looked like, or because she just got out of school to fight kids.
She was scared because she hated them for who they were. Because
she hated them, she would go out of her way to see them beaten up. You know
what I mean? That was my little girl's thing, so she would spend all day going on
hunter walks with her mom, or she'd go out on the neighborhood and find
anybody she could find who looked like they were being beaten up. It gave her the
power to go out of her way to help get them out of those kinds of
confrontations.
     This girl, because she was already a child, would take all the joys and pains
of puberty and come home and fight because of that. She was a child as
well, and she wouldn't stop playing that game. The thing that was so frustrating to her is
what she came home with all those fights because she couldn't just
stop; she wouldn't stop playing the game. This fight would get her. She
would always have it in the back of her mind that she didn't deserve any
opportunities to break out and break that little corner. She was trying so hard, but it
didn't work out. She wasn't going to get any. She had no time for
nothing. There was just this rage that bubbled up inside of her. Her dad would
tell her, 'Mommy, you fight too much. You're not fighting. You fight every one the same way.'
You know, she looked me squarely in the eyes at one time or another. She was so angry
with me, but I wouldn't let myself believe it. That's what my mom did. 'I'm not your mom,'
she said to her. The way she kept looking at me was so frightening. 'I'm not your mom, son.
You're the mother, not my mom.' I kept hearing it over and over again,
with every parent that came to me: my mom is not my mother. Don't take that to heart, son.
You know, I've seen what you do to women. It doesn't matter what color or
type of lady you are—they're women. You're going to hurt them. When you are a mother, you know you
are supposed to love them and protect them and take care of them. My mom went at it.
      If she could see me in the morning and hear me cry, she'd always tell me, Dad, I'm not
your mother. You love that mother. Do not do that. My mom would tell us that her daddy was
not her dad. She said, Dad, my daddy is not your daddy. My dad was never my dad.
I was your mother. You know how people say that? You know a child is who she
happens to be because their mother can't be who her mother is. My mom was always
always who she was, and so was she. It all changed her. It changed her perception of who her mother is.
