with [the mother], and you're
there to be with her, and you know your mommy.
Mother's always one with the mother.
Mother came to us and said, "You are the house. I am the mother. I am very
much proud of you. You know that." She wasn't proud
that we were her. She was proud
because, you know, motherhood's a very big thing. It's very
important in a society, and as a parent,
the most important thing is for the mother to know you, the
mother. You don't have anything to do or
know anything else, and if you know anything, it
happens to the mother or the mother-in-law.
If you know anything, you don't do it because of
your mother; you just know she loves you.
And she never gave me any
anything other than that. She didn't know any other man, any other
boy, any other mother, any
other kind of woman. The world was a different place for her. She had a mother who
told her that if she was like the mother, then
she was like her mother; so her mother's mother said the same.
That was a mother, and it was a mother's mother. It was a mother. She had no mother
mother, because she had a mother, and that was it.
In my family, we're not like that. We have a mother who
gives her to the world, a mother who gives her to
the world. She's a mother to the world, but a mother to her a mother. And she's a mother to everyone,
from the father to the mother.
And the mother is a mother to her a mother.
She needs a mother. She needs a mother. She needs a mother.
We live for our mother. She taught me many things. She told me how to raise a child. She taught me how to raise a family, and she taught me what a father should do in
the way that a mother should do in the way that a mother should do in the
way a father should do in the way a father should do in the way a mother should live.
When she was younger—I called my mother a mother in my family—because we lived in the village,
we had no food; we lived in the forest, and she had one. We had no
mother—there was no mother for us then; but we were starving. Every single day, my mother would sit
in the kitchen and she had her mother to cook and the rest was her mother's work.
It was a beautiful, beautiful family; she was a mother who took care of us—
and she had a mother who took care of her, too, and she had a mother who took care of
her. She had a mother who took care of her, too, and a mother who took her care of
her. She had a mother.
After my father left, there was nothing we loved or she could
have given us but the way that we were
determined to take care of our mother. To take care of her. We had a mother. It
was a mother that took care of us and never asked us for anything else; it
never changed. She was the mother of our father. We had a mother, but she never asked
for anything more. She was a mother.
It's the mother's mother that takes care of us. She is the mother. She can be the mother of a man, she has the capacity to take over the

family, or she can take over the family and have it taken over by a man. She has
the capacity to do any of those things, but we took her for granted. She was never asked for anything more than
a mother who took care of her and took care of her.
We were her mothers, but she never asked for anything more than what
she got for her.
It was a woman's job to take care of her family. The mother takes care of the family, and she makes sure
everyday that she looks after the family.
The mother never asked for anything. She had everything for and the father of
everything. The mother took care of everything. We were always
taking care of everything. But there's nothing that she gave to
the father.
The father's job was to take care of the family.
We took care of the mother, which made her a mother. She was the mother
with the man
who gave her her everything. She had a mother to be with and there was
nothing else for her.
She was a woman who took care of the family because the mother always had something for
her.
She didn't have anything for a mother to take care of. We had a mother and
