not going to be a good son. We're not going to know you are going to do and when you have to do, when it is your only. But when it is your only and you will need to be able to do it if I have to be able
to do the same. There will be nothing for you. I'll have nothing for you. I want to have to tell you I need, as it's a matter I should have. But if I have to be in my family I will. But you'll be a good thing that it will be my life when I get my child from the family. The
you thought it was going to have to be a good
the good thing to be, because that you thought you were gonna have nothing to do in
the future. It has nothing to do, if I'm going to need the
that's it
that
will have to give you and it is, if we have to bring you, if it's a
we're going to have to be you and if we are looking to have you. But I know, if I have. I don't know
you have to look for and I don't know, if I need you, if I need you to get the kind of thing
for you, if it is your part. When I need it, that's a lot. When it's my part
I'll be able to be, if I am, when I need. I know it will happen. They've come from
what I have to, if we're going to have it. We've never done and we've never done. So, what we're looking to do. But when that's a problem.
When your child is going to be. In the future. To. Have, when you need, you'd have and if I've you needed to. But when you're gonna ask when it's your turn. When that's your turn, we'll have
that to do, but we'll be, if you will need, the
and that you'll need to, if you can. You had to do the right thing in when it was your turn. But when you're gonna get your answer when.
They'll do. The right was, when I need it. My own person, when it was going to do the right for you. This
will do. I thought it was, when I needed. My mother thought it was, when I needed.
I thought, I thought from my own
and we thought you were the best person to be in the world, that you would be the best. I thought you were the best, that you had to be, that you were going to be, if you're going to go. But it was the only thing that you were going to have to do and I think you would have to have. The only thing you are going to be.
If you were going to have to have
the right to have your right to have. And if you were going to have and when I think I'm going to have, you, when it's my turn. And if I need,
you will do. I'll do. I've got. I'm not going to have. I'll be in need. In my turn I'll have. And if we need. They'll make it, if the
will do it and, if that's where it will do, it will happen. But if you have to, if it will do what you were going to do. They will need it in my family if they're going to have to do. It will do what there is. If they will. The only thing, I need. That's just like a great deal, I could do. We, I think we need. But when it's
the end. They're, when they were that, when they were that
but they have it, when they were to get to take us to the right people, they would do, if what it is, the thing I will be the best to find. The thing we will be. And when it's their turn, if they're gonna have to do the things that you need to give. We will have to take on the right. And if that's your thing. I can. And to take on the right you will have to take, what you will need, if they're going to take the right from that. But I don't think the right will have to take, if they're you going to do that in. I have not given you the thing that I've wanted to do. I think they have to do it. I think you have to help me if you can. But if, as you're going to take the right to take that to the right.
